from bgrubb grubb subject mac ibm info-version send follow up to sorry about the header but the pnews here do not let one easily change the header and i give up after a year of try thi sheet be also available by ftp on in the a mac ibm info-version the reason for thi general datum sheet be to consolidate and condense the information out there so that person in both camp can be clear and accurate about what they be say about their machine since computer technology be alway change there be alway go to be point in which the sheet will be lack or incorrect on information so please just do say the sheet be incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to make the need correction all price be in u dollar to keep thi datum sheet organize please provide if possible article citation for the information provide or correct and keep the opinion to a minimum a thi be a general datum sheet keep the info provide simple so i can understand what be be talk about and can explain it to other finally keep the information relevant to the section correct for example o code in rom be software contain in hardware so no more of the it be support in o disk software datum for the hardware section please thank you note for proper read off line thi document should be in point monaco special thank to andrew chihuahua charlie andrew andrew klossner bell-peter peter bell bcoleman

show motorola intel cpu use in mac and most clone machine for example since apple never use the motorola and in the mac these chip be not list year only appear with dead cpu and indicate first to last year use a a cpu cache note both ibm and mac use cach external to the cpu these external cach increase the speed of the cpu but be not a part of it in most of the present mac there be external cach built-in while with ibm they be optional though machine be generally sell with them instal since there be many different external cach cpu-mac and ibm scsi video disk and static ram-mac each have a different effect on cpu performance and they be machine static ram cache in iicus iifx and iivx seller cache card instal in some iici or expansion iicus cache card go up to dependent i have decide to

create a limit the ha clock an internal processor clock pclk that be freq of external bu clock bclk which be the one use to rate the chip bradley lamont motorola datum book some compiler produce program sensitive to the pclk and so they act a if the wa a clock doubler chip but thi very compiler and program dependent complier maybe write to allow program to take consitant advantage of the pclk in the future a it be now study such a one in a byte article which show and roughly be very dependent on the machine o and program test and a such be not representative of general performance motorola

list a a general rule of thumb motorola chip be faster than intel chip at the same frequency but intel ha chip at higher frequency than motorola so thi even out the macintosh bible ed support the comparison between intel and motorola chip for the and above v chip datum addres register the limit on the mac bring it down to the and lower chip otherwise it would compare to the hardware segment v alu and these chip come have no usable built-in mmu unlike their successor the hardware segment protect mode be use by and window the use of the hardware segment and their nature put the between the and in feature and the lc datum path strenghthen the comparison two chip with mmu and protect memory be at present the only mac o to use the protect memory feature for app system use thi feature to protect a ram disk create by the memory control panel but thi be support only on powerbook and quadra the color classic and lcius hardware datum path make the in them comparative to same a and without the fpu use a a low cost solution for person who do not need the fpu only with program sensitive to pclk pipelining do the behave like fpu or a two microprocessor with built-in fpu mmu internal cache which be implement a two cach in the and one in the only with program sensitive to pclk pipelining do the behave like a pentium both be plan to be superscalar but both have heat problem these chip may

almost every time you add something requirement for add-in card driver video and operate system in the ibm world intel microsoft and other hardware and software developer be work out and play standard pc week color mac mhz pixel clock standard all present mac support the use of color through color quickdraw in rom color quickdraw allow an almost transparent capability to display and edit x-bit image in y bite color and retain all the color of y-bit color where x and y independently be or regardles of monitor resolution dpus color to dpus palettebook or monitor type include autosynchronou vga mcga and svga monitor with range include hz vertically and khz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor macuser aug older machine that support color ius iix and iicx have only color in rom and need a software patch to use color macuser special to keep cost down and speed up most mac have only or bite display capability built-in but most of those can be expand to display color presently quickdraw be optimize for dpus display quickdraw qx will change thi in addition quickdraw allow in mac with a nubu slot more then one monitor to be use in any combination from two monitor show the same thing to multiple monitor act a one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the picture vram video ram standard for present non-powerbook mac handle of built-in video from a color palette vram provide run a color display expandable to color or a display sound output standard in all mac since the stereo sound become standard with the ibm even though pc have rom bio definition of how the operate system interact with the video hardware nan zou the use of driver bypass bio video hareware inconsitancy see super vga below and nonstanderzation of clone bio have leave resolution of video display hardware o and program interaction up to the o and video hardware in question faisal nameer jawdat in addition ibm and clone maker never bother to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode be actually present matt healy nor a standardize screen-drawing toolbox like mac qd a a result the o must be very well write to detect some mode especially with some third party card or to use them consitantly at present thing be so dependent on the interaction of the program o print driver and monitor card that edit picture regardles of color mode o and monitor combination a one can do on the mac be impossible with an ibm for example one can not edit a color picture do on a with a svga monitor on a with vga color palette and do and still have all the color one start out with later ibm machine will have integrate graphic accelerator faster processor and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound card cd rom and ethernet pc week mda monocrome display adapter original character-mapped video mode no graphic text cga color graphic array color or color palette bad for the eye ega enhanced graphic array color from color palette and some lower re some version could run at color bearable on the eye vga video graphic array at color at color and some other these two be the most commonly use all mode have a clut from a to ibm or a mac color palette mhz pixel clock mel martinez monitor use analog input incompatible with ttl signal from etc mcga multi-color graphic array subset of vga that provide all the feature of mda cga but lack some ega and vga mode like vga dictionary of computer terms-dct common on the initial implementation from ibm and some model svga super vga thi be not a standard in the way the other be but instead wa a all category for a group of video card a such with each manufacturer use their own implementation scheme svga wa chao with person debate a to what be svga and what be not in an effort to make svga more of a standard vesa wa establish and be use in the newer unit but thing be still a me video be either or today resolution of and at and color be common newer one since have the sierra hicolor ramdac give color at some of the very newer one can do bite per pixel usually at speedwise too much variation some very slow western digital paradise base for example some very fast base for example some be so-so like tseng a very popular chipset some limit factor overcome by vl bu linear addres map be mhz isa bu at architecture where the cpu look at the card through a window etc other non-svga standard ibm own standard interlace graphic accelerator with graphic function like linedraw polygon fill etc in hardware some clone implementation from atus be the fastest video available today though some clone model do not have interlace high end graphic co-processor usually some do speed up vector-oriented graphic like cad xga extended graphic array newer and faster than only available for mca bus-based clone be come out soon emulate vga ega and cga dct max resolution at same a also some bpp mode accelerate graphic function up to time faster than standard vga in window and include line draw bite and pixel-block transfer area fill mask and address ha an intelligent way to detect and co exist with other card so multiple desktop like on the mac may not be far away since thi be an architecture it resolution and color depth be fix ibm implement only color while other company can have color through ibm technical license refresh rate up to hz ensure flicker free rock solid image to reduce visual discomfort and be vga compatible up to on some monitor type usable by mac-see mac section above for specific detail expansion both mac ibm scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner nubu card expansion mac plu only some monitor and cd-rom main problem there be a lot of external device which be internal terminate which cause problem for more then two devise off the scsi port a scsi chain be suppose to be terminate only at the begin and at the end any other set up cause problem for either mac or ibm device per scsi controller asynchronou ave and synchronou max transfer difference be due to software driver fast be a misname for in mode see for detail device per scsi controller in mode be fully compliant and tend to be implement a a very fast since it do not require the different controller interface in hardware and software that and do transfer speed be with burst with burst and with burst and fast since can use software driver and hardware at speed and a such be limit to device sometime it be mistakenly call fast fast require a software driver and electronic but can still use the port wide and require a different scsi port electronic and software driver from which make them more expensive than other scsi interface mac scsi asynchronou built-in standard since the plu even though apple develop some specification for scsi controler the o scsi manager need to be rewrite to take full advantage of the feature of both scsi interface a a result present mac use a a fast asynchronou presently quadra be the only mac with a controller chip built-in digital review oct though they lack some other part of the hardware like the wide port interface since other mac require a nubu card to use older nubu mac have a bottleneck due to the speed of the nubu and cpu rumor-some cyclone mac june will come with a wide fast port standard and have a rewrite o scsi manager ibm scsi be not too wide spread yet generally not bundle with system except a add-on eisa and vesa local bu adapter avalable like the mac be use a a very fast by most controller out there unlike the mac ibm ha no exact scsi controller specification which result in add incompatibility for scsi mac memory expansion with a few exception the mac ha use non-parity simm memory expansion since the plu while parity simm could be use in these mac only special iici could make use of the parity feature by convension both simm type be call simm the iifx use parity simm the lc iius and all use a new simm that be accessable by at a time and be use in ibm the mac do a complete memory check at startup by every memory location if something be seriously wrong with a simm the mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicate what the problem be since mac make before feb manage memory baced on datum path simm have to be instal in pair or in set of the centri and quadra eliminate thi with a new memory management setup that allow memory to be upgrade one simm at a time if the simm be the same size be use then the memory be acros the two simm result in a performance boost on ram acces macworld apr printer adb and modem built-in interface standard monitor interface and sound input built-in on most present mac pd available in se all present non-powerbook mac se

burst mode future card design will be instead of the old quickring a peer-to-peer bu use in parallel with nubu apple vlbu architecture be identical to that of vlbu byte burst mode byte in development cpu expansion handle either through the pd or the nubu unlike pd nubu cpu card example-radiu rocket allow use of multiple processor at the same time thi be like have two or more mac in the same box able to dual task or joinly proces depend on the card or software involve each nubu card need it own memory but most nubu card of thi type come with ram simm on the card standard ibm memory expansion parity simm non-parity simm some newer model do a mac like simm memory check or a dozen or so different type of memory board hd interface limit to hard drife by design or lack of development mfm modified frequency modulation rll run length limited only use with smaller hard drife ide integrated device electronic asynchronou max and synchronou max transfer currently the most common standard

development ose assume full installation print driver font multifinder etc and multiple application use mac to of o and hardware command have be put into rom thi allow apple to control it machine by put key hook for the mac o quickdraw menu command print mouse scsi sound driver etc in rom which require clone maker to use the rom chip or read rom on to disk which require acces to the proper mac since different mac have slightly different rom chip plu v classic for example with key hook for the o support interface in rom programer do not have to worry a much whether the disk o ha the necessary hardware command or that those command be consitant and therefore can write smaller program thi also allow apple greater control over hardware-software standard and that the disk o can be smaller and with some of the tookbox command code in rom with lower ram requirement then a totally disk base o mac use masked rom which be a fast a dram jon wtte single program usage base requirement

o instead of allow free upgrade bundled with new machine for upgrade otherwise the installer ha a bug that when upgrade it may keep some old system font from the previou system inside the system file thi can eat up any ram benefit and cause other problem apple itself recommend remove all font from the system file unix need ram suggest hard drive and a or equivalent to run thi preemptive multitasking o be large due to be unix and need translator between it and the mac rom price note sound output wa support in ose to by many format include the follow snd wave asnd fssd qssn smsd soun and dcfl in the sound manager wa optimize for the sound standard and aiff which cause some playback problem for the old format though most still play ibm machines have little gui code datum and hook present in hardware for programmer to work with so most of the cod must be provide in the o since hard disk be slow the disk o code be read into ram in addition what little rom code there be also read into ram a proces call shadow rom thi result in faster implementation since ram be faster then prom or eprom having most of the o code on disk ha the advantage of be able to better optimize the code give a certain piece or collection of hardware which be harder with a rom base system due to the need in addition it reduce the need for and size of patch if a major revision of the hardware support be need side note the ftc charge that microsoft form a o trust by not provide all feature documentation for it ose to developer outside m and design it window and do app to fail under undocumented window and there be deliberate code in window nt betum which cause the install to abort if boot manager be present gregory hick info-ibmpc digest due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the ftc judicial council for action against microsoft wa a tie which result in no action rumors-the ftc will presue the matter likely to the point of choose a new member or whole new council in addition the government ha turn down microsoft copyright of window which would allow it to charge a fee for developer use their hook pc week microsoft ose do ha a barrier with it own memory manager a

be a problem with either mac of ibm machine especially if one send truetype font to a older style postscript printer mac hardware built-in localtalk network port and a built-in printer port localtalk ha moderate speed require special connector for each machine and up and can be run off of either the printer port to include very old mac or the network port standard today built-in ethernet be become common but many older mac require a pd or nubu card at about for each machine these card provide three connector and transceiver thick thin and for ethernet the macintosh quadra family and some centri model include ethernet interface on motherboard with transceiver available tokenring ha be a network option since software appletalk the suite of protocol standard with mac o which can use variety of

the screen bitmap font quickdraw qx be suppossed to fix thi and similar problem ibm hardware localtalk not widely use ethernet and tokenring software novell netware banyan vine decnet group appletalk protocol and appleshare subset of appletalk each of the ms-do network scheme be in general totally incompatible with the other once you have choose one you be pretty much locked-in to that product line from then on group be a little more forgive and remove some of thi problem novell netware be the biggest percent of the corporate market and in general be more powerful and offer better than appleshare but it also more complex to set up and manage thi will change due to the use of the mac finder and file management system by novell pc week infoworld dec macweek printing very o dependent do if it a single user then you plug the printer into the parallel port and do worry about it tweeking may be need with poorly write software network printing be not control by the system but be mostly implement by the actual program therefore performance vary from one software program to the next window support standard driver and can do a good job of show job in the print queue but it alway list printer a active even if they be not thi become a problem if there be several incompatible printer on the same net because there no way for software to reliably determine which printer be active right now window for workgroup be more mac-like and intelligent about thi mac-like the o deal with printer with app make call to the o printing bug due to poor program some program for all the above ose do not have wysiwyg print thi be the fault of the program in question and not that of the o involve price issue thi be very dynamic with mac provide more build-in feature than ibm and ibm be more only what you need then mac and price war by both world the ibm machine modualar nature prevent any kind of true hardware standarization which in turn require ose and program to be very complex to handle all the variation in hardware when one add all the standard mac hardware feature to an ibm built-in sound support scsi pd built-in monitor support built-in network standard mouse interface and nubu in higher machine the mac tend to be cheaper then an equivalent equipted ibm machine especially since some ibm monitor can be use with mac which cut some more of the mac cost macuser aug some
