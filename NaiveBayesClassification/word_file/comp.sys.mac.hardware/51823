from hade brian v hughe subject re centri math coprocessor option write sorry if thi be a faq i do normally read i be purchase a couple of centri i configure the system a follow eight mb ram ethernet mb vram math coprocessor option my purchase agent tell me about the math coprocessor option and send me the apple summary documentation to prove it i order the coprocessor option but i really not sure that we need it i think the chip have a math coprocessor build into it ha apple have a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the chip in the centri i be concern that i may have set up a hardware bottleneck apple ha really confuse person with thi whole thing i think we be answer thi question for about the next year or so there be no option to get an fpu on a what you have be a choice of cpu there be the that do not have an integrate fpu like the full and be only present in the base model of the appleusa and there be the full which you get when you order anything other than the base configuration therefore since you have order one of the version with on-board ethernet model you will not be get the but even if you want to have the you would be able to order a with ram on-board ethernet and an it not an option also a note to person out there that have and think that there be an optional fpu the clas chip can not recognize an external fpu so there be no socket on the motherboard for a fpu chip and you can not go out and purchase an fpu on a pd card or something like that the only way to get an fpu in these machine be to replace the with a full and if you have a you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the with the full but if you have a you do need to have a heat sink hade
