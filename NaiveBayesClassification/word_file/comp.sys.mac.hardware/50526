from dcb david c blume subject can not move datum fast enough i want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around megabyte sec for very large datum transfer around mb i have a quadra i have a nubu network card that can pump datum in to mac memory at use block-mode transfer i have a high-speed disk array no asynchronou pb call that can achieve let say all transfer go from disk to buffer to network card it be not enough to first transfer all the datum from the disk to buffer then transfer all the datum from the buffer to card then result in an overall too slow so i try the follow scheme for an n-megabyte transfer step load the mb from disk to buffer step asynch send mb out card load the mb from disk to buffer step asynch send mb out card load the mb from disk to buffer step n asynch send the mb out card load the nth mb from disk to buffer step send the nth mb out card even though the code apparently do execute the card transfer asynchronously and the card do not use the mac cpu at all it be use the buffer tho each of the step through n take a long a if the two transfer be execute one after another so there be no improvement in the rate why is the mac ram dual-port so the nubu card and the disk driver can both acces datum at the same time is the problem that the two device card and disk driver both have to use the same bu to mac ram is there anything i can do david david blume i get tire think of all the thing i dcb do want to do bukowski barfly
