from buzz steve bollinger subject re stereo sound problem on mac game in article isy ingemar ragnemalm ingemar write enter game developer the sound driver and current sound manager be inconveniently lame for make game the sound driver be pretty ok since it fast sound manager use by the book be useles disposing of sound channel a soon a sound ha complete be out of the question for game with smooth animation it too slow why would you dispose a channel if you be go to play more sound soon if you be try to write a game you should be use sndplay instead make a channel and use buffercmd to play sound on it it work great you can add callback to the channel also to let you know when the channel be get empty before it get empty the sound driver be so much snappier than sound manager unfortunately system support it poorly make program crash occasionally the moral of the story be to developer do cheat well i want my code to work on old system too i do know about sy but at least on there be bug in the sound manager that cause channel to hang with no error message thi happend when i keep a channel open for long period necessary for performance and play many sound stop sound halfway callback seem not to be reliable then only way i can safely tell if a sound ha stop play be to inspect private variable in the channel qhead i think it wa and the only way i have find to tell if a channel be hang be to inspect an undocumented flag and modify it callback be very reliable i find them reliable even under system i wa do continuou background sound with interrupt sound effect on system with the im-v documentation you probably be cancel ymy callback command out of ymy channel of course you do get call in general if you have problem with sound work when you play one per channel and then close the channel with the relate slowdown but then when you play more than one you do work then you be add more than one synthesizer to a channel possibly the same one multiple time thi might be because you be call sndplay on a preexist channel with a sound resource which add the sample sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it play most sample sound have thi command at the start of them you need to resedit the sound and remove that command then when you create ymy channel specify the sample sound synthesizer to be the channel synth then you can use asynch sndplay all you want you probably want to switch to buffercmd since you be go to have to use snddocommand anyway to add callback now before you go ahead and tell me i be full of it and the sound manager do work for game remember spectre use it and it work great if spectre can spare the cpu time you can too one little disclaimer there be some out there who say the sound manager in the iisi ca be make to work right i not sure either way but i know for sure that you can make ymy sound work correctly on every other machine use the sound manager steve
