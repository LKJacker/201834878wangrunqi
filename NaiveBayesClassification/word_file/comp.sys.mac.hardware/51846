from steve bollinger buzz subject re stereo sound problem on mac game in article skc doug p book dpb write hi i think i have a problem with the stereo sound output on my quadra but i be not totally sure because my roomate ha the same problem on hi powerbook any info or experience anyopne ha would be greatly appreciate when i hook my quadra up to my home stereo system the follow type of sound mono a far a i can tell all play fine through both speaker system beep already provide one such a indigo and one i record armor alley spectre spaceward ho but the follow game only play out of the leave channel lemming out of thi world awesome game btw glider oid but still stereo system beep do play in stereo through both speaker the one i specifically referrring to be apocolyptic beginning which my roommate download from some ftp site sumex all of the symptom be the same on my rommate he ca run ootw because he do have color we both run system do anyone with lemming or the other three game i mention above get sound out of both speaker on a mac ius clas quadra lc powerbook or greater centri etc stereo machine i use to have a mac ius and i sort of rememeber lemming play in stereo on that machine not just on the leave channel i could be mistake though if there be a problem with the quad and pb i be wonder why the system beep still play in stereo if there be a problem with my machine i wonder why the game above be apparantly write to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sound so the mono sound would at least come out of both speaker like spectre etc do quadra and powerbook have the same rom to my knowledge so maybe thi be a rom problem if so though why would system patch over thi problem thank for any help you can provide in article jon wtte write mac sound hardware be diverse some mac play in stereo and mix the output the for instance while other play in stereo but only ha the leave channel for the speaker while some be truly mono like the lc developer know that stuff play in the leave channel be guarantee to be hear while the right channel be some send datum to both some only send datum to the leave channel the first be preferrable of course okay i gues it time for a quick explanation of mac sound the original documentation for the sound hardware document how to make sound by directly access hardware basically you jam value into all the even byte from soundbase to thi wa because of how the mac and some later machine generate sound wa by scan thi block and every even byte the odd byte go to the floppy on some machine when the mac ius and apple sound chip wa invent it wa design to generate stereo sound it wa also design to be compatible with we have once document so store byte at the even value at soundbase mean i want to play a mono sound and so it wa emulate but apple have since retract the documentation on soundbase and decide not to document the lowest layer of sound generation so apple never explain where to stuff byte if you want to make stereo sound enter game developer the sound driver and current sound manager be inconveniently lame for make game furthermore person who port from the ibm do want to learn more api so it ha become popular for game writer to write to soundbase to make sound since it be very easy since the mac ius apple ha have many different kind of sound output hardware and the only thing they have in common be that write to soundbase work on some hardware mac ius iix iicx iicus at least write to soundbase get you mono sound through both speaker on some mac quadra at least write to soundbase get you mono sound on the leave channel only both be technically correct interpretation of the original specification but one be obviously preferable for asthetic reason if developer use the sound manager and i think the sound driver mono sound will typically come out through both channel regardles of the underlie hardware it be possible to specify you want to generate leave channel only but no one do if developer write to sound base their game will only come out the leave on some game the other problem the original mac ius only produce leave channel sound on the internal speaker while the mix both be really relate it be due to the post generation amplification use on the motherboard of the different machine it only affect true stereo sound sound which be actually mono will play on the internal speaker no matter what machine you have now to more directly addres the question the game you list lemming out of thi world awesome game btw glider oid and also hellcat super tetri oxyd and many more these be just what i test cheat and write to soundbase and so be only leave channel on quadra other game you list armor alley spectre spaceward ho and also pga tmy golf civilization and more these be again only from personal experience use the sound manager and work fine on all machine the more of the story be to developer do cheat really i be absolutely positively not allow to do what i be about to do but i go say it anyway stop cheat on sound really soon you will be sorry a even those without external speaker will be disappoint with ymy sound on future hardware the grace period be about to end the sound manager be understandable now and work pretty well and will work even better soon so use it in conclusion to doug it be a hardware problem at least not a bug to jon it be a choice to developer a to whether they want to send sound to both channel if they do it the right way it be take care of automatically if you cheat there be not way to make it work on all hardware have fun disclaimer number i do work on sound here at apple i just pretty well inform so do write me with sound question disclaimer number if it say up above that i write anything like the grace period be about to end then it be a bug in ymy news fee since i be catagorically not allow to say anything like that you know what i mean disclaimer number i do speak for apple just me
