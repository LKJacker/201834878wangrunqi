from michael amere subject how do they compare i believe it go or will go powerpc pentium in a resent article in one of the macmag i think a accelerator wa slightly slower than a accel but thi be use a system design for the so it stand to reason that a system design for an ie quadra would do better so overall i figure or so along the same line the new powerpc stuff be suppose to run the system at the level of a fast quadra but system or whatever will allow time the speed of a in the powerpc base system and wait for the i think it lap the pentium pro-life pro-woman michael amere internet
