from especkma erik a speckman subject re why the drive speed differ in article write the most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a greater density of information exist on the larger capacity disk drive than the smaller one if ymy run the drive on a mac i would recommend a shareware utility call timedrive which test seek scsi throughput and rotational speed thi utility should let you know what the difference be between the drife the view express in thi post those of the individual author only bb number maccontent be victoriau first iconic bb larger drife tend to have multipule platter which can allow adjacent bite to be read in parallel result in higher throughput they also have higher spindle speed which lead to both increase throughput and reduce seek time due to reduction of rotational latency erik speckman
