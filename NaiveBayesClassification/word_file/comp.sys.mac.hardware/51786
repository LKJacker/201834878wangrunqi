from dashley doug ashley subject re se rom seanmcd write in article wgw william g wright write anyway i wa hop someone knowledgeable about mac internal could set me straight be it simply impossible for a mac se to print grayscale or could someone arm with enough info and a little pro gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the rom capability to use the grayscale feature i believe you need a mac equip with colmy quickdraw i wa tell thi somewhere or other but it not mention in apple fact guide for apple seller in the pres release or in the technical spec sean i think you will find that the mac se can print grayscale image load with the proper software however the mac se can not display grayscale on it screen or any attach video because that ability be not in the rom so while you might be able to print grayscale you have a hard time seeing the grayscale image you want to print doug thi signature under construction wyvern technology tidewater premier online information system login guest password guest to register
