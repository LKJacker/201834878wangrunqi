from jason s macdonald subject re lc ram upgrade will be slow douce andrew geweke write i can not speak for dale but i be quite sure that the macintosh use the full or datum path to it full advantage that be it be run a fast with two or fmy simm a it would with one simm now it may be that longword access assume a datum path here get the first byte from the first simm the second byte from the second and so on thi would mean that each longword of memory be actually split among fmy simm one for each byte on the other hand it could be that the simm be interleave by word or longword not just by byte or they could be successive in memory and the memory controller deal with the eight-bit datum path that each one ha i suspect though that they be interleave to some extent so that bite can be read or write at once thi would indicate a byte-level interleave i be not confuse thi with the new machine longword interleave with two simm of the same sort although that seem to be the same sort of idea there you get an essential datum path ro excuse me to ram instead of just a one ye the cpu ca handle it but when write to successive address it speed something up so dale be i right simm be interleave by byte allow the full datum bu or a be common with usenet and me in particular be i a clueles a everyone else what conclusion can be draw from thi i try to figure out what kind of memory configuration for the lc iius datapath would be fastest any idea thank jason macdonald jason scott macdonald technology sufficiently advance be indistinguishable from magic cat exist so that we arthur c clarke may care the lion
