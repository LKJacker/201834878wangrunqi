from fredm fred g martin subject re adapter for iisi and a vga monitor in article chou dongseok chous write i understand that if i have a correct adapter then i can use a vga monitor with my iisi are those adapter work with specific brand is adapter for nec or sony work with other brand i will be use a vga monitor with iisi for a month soon i do have any clue what monitor will be here the story the iisi can not supply a vga output however some vga-type monitor can adequately deal with the video signal the mac use to drive the apple or inch high resolution color display apple own mode so if you wish to hook one of these monitor up to ymy iisi you need a an adapter that convert from the mac connector to the vga-style high density connector but tell the mac to use it own mode not the vga mode and b a vga monitor that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the mac mode over the vga mode which a i state in above the iisi can not produce a far a a above be concern contact jame engineering inc fairmount ave el cerrito ca fax they can probably get you the right adapter remember you do not want the run-of-the-mill mac-to-vga adapter because it will try to have ymy iisi produce the vga mode which it can not the computer will just fail to produce any video signal at all instead you want an adapter that connect between the mac-style and vga-style connector but tell the mac to use the apple mode sorry for the poor terminology available for describe thi distinction a far a b be concern make sure to get a monitor that can deal with a horizontal bandwidth of khz and a vertical retrace rate of hz these be the spec of apple mode for comparison the vga-standard mode use a khz horizontal bandwidth and a hz vertical retrace rate the monitor will probably need to have capability a the apple mode you be use be one of the set of standard mode in the pc compatible world good luck fred martin fred martin fredm ame st rm epistemology and learning group mit medium lab cambridge ma usa
