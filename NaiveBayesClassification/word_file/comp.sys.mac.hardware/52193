from carlo carlo tiana subject quadra marginal video we be have a problem with a quadra that ha stump a couple of tech send to u by the vendor a well a u thi quadra be with ram vram and some large disk i think what happen be that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry vertical sync it be quite apparent that the mac cpu be still ok and the problem really seem to lie with the video circuitry since you can still save ymy document quit ymy aplpication even pull down menu etc only the display be scroll lik crazy so it pretty hard to hit menu item we have the original logic board replace twice now and the same problem ha be occur on all board although the inteval between occurrence ha vary the first board have thi problem every about more often if the cache wa turn off ye off thi be the only symptom that be not obviously relate to the video circuitry after all the cache be on the cpu right the second board have the problem every about minute we do not keep it rather we put the original back the current board we have ha thi problem a lot le often ha go about a week without do it but do it twice within an hmy yesterday the technician that have come out to try to figure it out seem pretty sharp and try a number of sensible thing most of which we have previously try ourself anyway these include swap the ram swap the vram swap monitor different apple rgb and apple rgb swap cable disconnect hd and boot from floppy sacrifice variou small mammal here be some other fact when we put a rasterop procolor on the nubu the problem be fix it do not occur with the internal video or the procolor video out the vendor can not reproduce the problem back in their shop on the board that exhibit it in my lab apple be say to be get a little bite piss off at ship u board that they can not find anything wrong with and get them ship back a faulty accord to u here be some speculation i bet that neither apple nor the vendor ha test these board with that much ram and vram on them simultaneaously which may have something to do with their find it hard to reproduce the problem though we can reproduce it with just of ram so thi be probably a red herring the vendor representative blame in ymy wall claim that my wall have metal in them which interfere with the mac operation we have another in the lab which work like a charm though it not in the exact same spot please do tell me thi be probably it i do not want to believe it it probably not poltergeist since they do not have badge to get past security at the entrance to my site ha anyone any idea please please email a well a post cause i seem to be spend a lot of time reboot my mac lately and have a lot le time available to read news thank you in advance carlo tiana nasa ame research center carlo carlo carlo we alway remember you have a choice carlo
