from b-clark brian clark subject re high resolution adc for mac ius in article b-clark brian clark write i do know about the instrutech board though i plan to check them out but you need to be very careful check the monotonicity and ratio of many of the bite board out there the ni board be very clearly specify in term of monotonicity ratio accuracy etc and the and have all the dyynamic range and freedom from distortion that you expect from a good true bite converter thi be not true for the spectral innovation board for example to boorishly reply to myself i find i do have the instrutech information already the spec to use the term loosely be a follow bite converter with bite accuracy to khz bite accuracy to khz no spec for monotonicity linearity there be multiplexed input share the single so that all input be not sample at the same time and in the above conversion spec the all-channel sample rate must be use thu for two channel you only have unknown quality bite at khz per channel thi be poorer quality than the national instrument at the same sample rate bite converter no spec for monotonicity linearity each of the output channel ha it own converter the price for the external converter box the the nubu interface board the plu c driver software and igor xop be rather steep
