from guykuo guy kuo subject quadra clock modification long here be how i modify my quadra for higher speed previously i have be use a variable speed overdrive for accelerate my cpu but thi modification be test out a more stable at higher speed ymy mileage may vary the top speed you achieve can not be predict before hand my personal ha test fine up to mhz thu far i do have higher speed clock oscillator on hand to test higher speed part clock oscillator pin ttl variety you will need a selection of speed begin at mhz on up the cpu will run at the oscillator speed the original one be a mhz unit i recommend get a mhz clock in case you damage the exist one i obtain my clock oscillator from digikey for le than each some of their part number be mhz ttl clock oscillator part mhz ttl clock oscillator part mhz ttl clock oscillator part do get the half size clock oscillator they wo fit there be also cmo clock oscillator i have try one in a quadra they work fine in iisi socket obtain a pin socket which be in the same form factor a a pin dip package alternatively use machine socket pin from an augat style socket just cut them out of the socket cooling fan a very small volt fan to keep the cpu cool be a must my vso come with a specially modify heatsink which have a fan build onto it it have a pass-through connector which tap into the hard drive power cable you should rig up something similar or risk fry ymy cpu procedure insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warn here remove the top lid of the machine you will see the floppy disk and hard drive mount in a plastic tower follow the usual anti-static precaution and of course make sure the machine be off when you do thi unplug all cable wall and monitor power supply cord from the back of the mac remove the power supply by pull the plastic interlock tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pull the power supply straight up the tab be a piece of plastic from the leave posterior aspect of the tower which extend downward to hook on to the power supply you may also feel a horseshoe shape piece at the right portion of the power supply leave that alone the plastic tab from the tower be all you need release look at the rear of the tower assembly you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable lead to the floppy drive disconnect all these from the motherboard the hard drive power cable connector ha a tab which must be squeeze to release it unplug the drive activity led from it clear plastic mount look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower a phillip head screw be at the base remove it take care not to drop it into the case a bite of gummy glue on ymy screwdriver be helpful here remove the tower assembly by pull medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower thi tab prevent the tower from slide posteriorly slide the entire tower assembly cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case remove the interrupt switch assembly it be a strangely shape plastic device at the leave front edge of the motherboard pull the middle rear plastic prong up and forward the entire device will release unplug the speaker cable squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backward to free it from the case remove the motherboard form the case lift the front right corner of the motherboard about mm thi allow it to clear the clear plastic power light guide slide the motherboard forward about cm the motherboard then come directly out locate the mhz clock crystal it be a small metal box near the cpu chip note and remember it orientation the new clock oscillator must be align with pin in the same orientation very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator some of the pin may be bend over simply desolder then unbend them be sure ymy desoldering iron be hot enough before heat the board i use a suction desoldering iron to accomplish thi task thi be not appropriate for a first solder experience the motherboard be a multi-layer design with very fine trace easily damage without proper care install ymy socket or socket pin where the old oscillator once wa put a mhz clock oscillator into the new socket you could use the old clock but it ha solder on it pin thi may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problem later i suggest use a new mhz clock install ymy cool fan system to complete the modification reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board firmly plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard reinstall the tower assembly by first place the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about cm posterior of it intend position lower the tower assembly into place while maintain contact with the right wall of the case once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it click into place reconnect the motherboard end of the cable forget the floppy drive cable replace the phillip head screw drop the power supply straight down into place until it click in plug the hard drive activity light back into it clear plastic mount reattach ymy cable and power cord cros ymy finger and turn on the mac it should make the usual power on chord if it do something be amis immediately turn of the power and recheck ymy handiwork if all be not well you have my sincere condolence hopefully all will work normally turn the machine back off and replace the mhz clock oscillator with a faster one reboot and be astound you will need to fully test the machine for many hour before decide a particular speed be truly usable with my vso a machine lock-up might take hour of operation to occur in the brief time since modify my clock oscillator hour i have not have a single problem good luck to all who attempt thi modification there be a small but real risk but you could well reach quadra speed or higher with le than in part guy kuo guykuo
