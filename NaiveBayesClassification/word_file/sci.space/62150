from aw allen w sherzer subject re shuttle bizarre dc-x in article beo khayash ken hayashida write well spenz what can i say you attack my beloved vehicle if i may offer a constructive criticism perhap you should decide if you love vehicle or the use they be put to i myself think the be a beautiful aircraft but rest assure i would even think of fly it in combat today most of u want acces to space and judge vehicle on how they perform we see zero-defect operation in many of life not to thi degree calling shuttle flight characteristic bizarre in the same post a tout dc-x be interest why dc-x will also have similar zero-defect issue be i wrong ymy wrong the dc approach be very tollerent of failure it also ha the advantage of far greater reliability do to it reusable nature shuttle be reusable it salvagable i be think of how dc-x will deploy a chute or reverse orientation at supersonic speed the flip over happen at a very low speed not supersonic if the dc-x show the flip over work it will work unles the law of physic change how much in dc-x be redundant that the real question the final will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop upon re-entry for example it can loose about of available thrust and still land safely everything we do in life ha zero-defect issue at time agree everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that not the same thing shuttle simply be a fault tolerent design ssto be a a doctor i can not error in my diagnosi and treatment recommendation you do put ymy patient in condition where there be no way out you would for example give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effect would you while dc-x r d program make good sense i be le optimistic about dc-x a you and apparently other be you be very much in the minority if the dc series fail to make orbit it will still be a very worthwhile effort it will show u exactly what we do need to do to build ssto but dc-x will still have failure it be the nature of aerospace r d again refer to the it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop shuttle do dc be fault tollerent shuttle be it successor be not slat to be passenger carry not true build a passenger pallet a fairly easy thing to do and it will carry passenger the impression i have when i visit macdac huntington beach open house wa that the payload space wa limit and the man-ratable version wa decade away i would suggest you talk to the dc-x crew themself their original schedule have an operational fly in shuttle be the only method in the free world of orbit large life science and medical relate package a for now it be my only ticket into space and ha my support ymy ignore the dammage it do manne space ha a reputation for be unreliable and hugely expensive shuttle supporter only make it easy for opponent of man space to kill it you could change my view on dc-x if you could prove the follow the only way to prove those thing be to build it allen lady astor sir if you be my husband i would poison ymy coffee w churchill madam if you be my wife i would drink it day to first flight of dcx
