from dietz paul dietz subject re what planet be habitable i would appreciate any think on what make a planet habitable for human i be make asumption that life and a similar atmosphere evolve give a range of physical aspect of the planet the question be what physical aspect simply disallow earth like condition thi be a good question there be major blind spot in my understand of what make the earth habitable for example why do the earth atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it do the naive answer be photosynthesi but thi be clearly incomplete photosynthesi by itself ca make the atmosphere oxygenate a the oxygen produce be consume when the plant decay or be eat what be need be photosynthesi plu some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the result reduce material on earth thi mechanism be burial in seafloor sediment of organic matter mostly from oceanic source however thi burial require continental sediment in the deep ocean the burial rate be so slow that most material be consume before it can be sequester thi suggest that a planet without large ocean or a planet without continent undergo weather will have a hard time accumulate an oxygen atmosphere in particular an all-ocean planet may have a hard time support an oxygen atmosphere there be also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth atmosphere ha be relatively stable over geological time for a period at least order of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric to weather in the absence of replenishment no convince feedback mechanism ha be identify perhap the reason be the weak anthropic principle if during the last myr or so the oxygen level have drop too low we would be here to be wonder about it paul f dietz dietz
