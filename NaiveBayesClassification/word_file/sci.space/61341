from ethanb ethan bradford subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article steinly steinn sigurdsson write thi do not propose a mechanism for grb in the oort and no anti-matter annihilation do not fit the spectrum at least a far a i understand annihilation spectrum big difference that ignore the question of how you fit a distribution to the oort distribution when the oort distribution be not well know in particular comet aphelium which be not well know be not a good measure of the oort cloud distribution merging neutron star be at least a mechanism with about the right energy except it do explain why there be no apparent correlation with galaxy or galaxy structure there be no mechanism for get all the energy out in gamma ray with any significant amount of baryon around there will be a lot of pair production which make a plasma which thermalize the energy it ha trouble generate enough energy to explain the most powerful burst erg it happen too fast compare to the burst duration and it be hard to make tight-binary of neutron star another cosmological mechinism be the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange star but that use pretty far-out physic my point be that we do have a good mechanism at any distance so grb be likely to be happen by an unknown mechanism so we ca rule out the oort cloud what would be the spectrum of an event which convert a comet to strange matter the spectrum for primordial black hole eat comet and antimatter comet collide with matter comet be quite right but perhap there be an unusual mechanism which modify the spectrum the energy match very well for both of these mechanism according to trevor week if the tunguska meteorite wa a mini-black hole collision with the earth then there be likely to be enough mini-black hole around that the rate for bh-comet collision match the grb rate well the fact that we do know the distribution of comet in the oort cloud be a reason to rule them out it make it harder to rule them out the point of the cite paper wa that if we assume they get the right distribution for the oort cloud it be hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of grb if they get the wrong distribution for the oort cloud they ca constrain any oort cloud grb at all executive summary we do know enough to rule out out the oort cloud
