from josh hopkin subject re space manuevering tug wa hst service mission prb pat write i write prb pat write given that what i describe for the hst seem to be the smt ha someone actually verify that ma be the predominant constraint on thi mission you seem to be assume it without give support evidence someone from nasa post that there be very significant ma margin on the hst re-boost mission a while back i have ask why not carry the edo pallet up and the answer wa the ma margin be tight enough they be even carry extra suit so how much ma be save by not burn the om that the critical question my datum show that the om engine hold kg of propellant of that a substantial fraction be go to be use for the first om burn the reentry burn and the reserve so pat tell u how much fuel the altitude change be go to take and how much the edo pallet and extra part be go ma if you can make the number work out then i be interest after you show u that it can be do then tell u how much the edo pallet and extra equipment be go to cost why not do thi quick test goldin philosophjy of faster cheaper better build a real fast space tug to handle the re-boost of the hst use clean cryo fuel and get it ready before the hst mission pat thi would be slower more expensive and worse where wingo when you need him come on knock that off you forget that during skylab they do overnight mission plan for the repair eva also during thexd intelsat mission they do overnight wetf simulation i somehow think they could train up a new eva in month first while astronaut certainly have do eva with minimal plan that wa because they have to they do like to do that a a general rule second remember why they have to improvise during intelsat they be try to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wa design to do that trying to shortcut the train be only go to make a repeat more likely third they do have eight month they have however much time be leave after someone come up with a plan show it can work and get it approve you may think i have a pessimistic attitude i think it realistic i not say that the engineer task be impossible few engineer task be what i say be that thi be neither cost effective nor feasible under nasa management and a for build hardware anything can be build if you want it bad enough you forget the bu be already build all they ahve to do be soup it up even test it on a deltum mission all they have to do be soup it up just what do that mean do get into thi mode of negativism beside at the rate mission slip the discovery wo launch on thi mission until march that almost a year more expensive ymy proposal still require the shuttle to do everything it wa go to do execpt fire the om in addition you add significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware ah but how much more expensive be the second hst service mission the second service mission be a contingency you have neither show that it would be necessary without ymy plan nor that it would be unnecessary with ymy plan you forget there be a bum fg the solar array electronic be get hinky and there be still month until the service mission no pat i have forget if the smt can avoid a second service mission that million save no pat that million minu the cost of the new hardware minu the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along minu development and mangement cost minu extra operate cost tanstaafl according to a gao report on the omv i have before me there be only two currently plan mission that could use such a vehicle hst and axaf since axaf ha since be scale back and hst can rely on the shuttle there do seem to be any need for ymy vehicle of course there wa any need for the saturn v after apollo too i sure that if you reread thi you see that ymy argument be falaciou a for the problem with the aperture door i be sure they can work out some way to handle that maybe a plug make from frozen ice it keep out any contamination yet sublime away after teh boost pat not only be thi messy and le reliable than a device that make to perform thi task it also ignore the point there be a desire to have astronaut available so that if the door fail to open something can be do about it unles you can provide a very reliable way of reopen the door you have solve the problem josh hopkin find a way or make one attribute to hannibal
