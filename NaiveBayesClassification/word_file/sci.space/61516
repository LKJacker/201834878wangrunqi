from nsmca subject mothership for flyby and cut cost getting wierd again okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to pluto be to large and to expensive okay what about launch one probe with multiple part kind of liek the old mirv principle of old cold war day basically what i mean be design a mother ship that ha piggy back probe for different mission namely different planet each probe would be tie in with the mother ship or earth a the case may be thi be good when and if we go for mar the mar mission can act a either mother ship or relay point for the probe also the mother ship would be power if not the mar mission by a normal propulsion but also a solar sail main reason for solar sail race be to see what can be do and autmoated the sail would get the probe to be they need i know the cloud and such might get in the way of a sail main reasonf ro mother ship idea be to make it more economoical to send multiple to different place and cut cost the probe could do fly by or we shall see michael adam nsmca i not high just jack
