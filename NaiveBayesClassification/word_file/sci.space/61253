notify and the article be reproduce in it entirety to the north pole on june and two of the soviet union mighty proton rocket lift off from the tyuratam space center in the kazakhstan republic aboard those booster be a new breed of venera probe for the planet venu designated venera and the probe be mean not for land yet more spherical craft on the venerean surface but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit to accomplish thi task the basic venera design wa modify in numerou area the central bu core wa make one meter inch longer to carry the two ton of propellant require for brake into orbit double the fuel carry by the venera and orbiter eight year earlier extra solar panel be add on to give the vehicle more power for handle the large amount of datum which would be create by the radar image the dish-shaped communication antenna be also make one meter larger to properly transmit thi information to earth atop the bus where lander be usually place be instal the by by polyu v side-looking radar antenna the radar system possibly a terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellite use by the soviet for earth ocean surveillance would be able to map venu surface at a resolution of one to two kilometer to mile the soviet probe image parameter be a vast improvement over the united state pioneer venu orbiter which could reveal object no smaller than kilometer mile in diameter and while the venera resolution wa comparable to that of similar observation make by the arecibo radio telescope on the island of puerto rico the orbiter would be examine the northern pole of venu thi region wa unobtainable by either arecibo or pioneer venu and appear to contain a number of potentially interest geological feature worthy of investigation on october after an interplanetary journey of million kilometer million mile and two mid-course correction venera fire it brake rocket over venu to place itself in a polar orbit by kilometer by mile around the planet complete one revolution every twenty-fmy hour venera follow suit fmy day later the twin probe thu become venu first polar-circling spacecraft radar operation begin on october for venera and october for venera for up to sixteen minute every orbit over the north pole the probe would make a radar sweep of the surface kilometer ninety mile wide and nine thousand kilometer mile long the craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbit over the south pole to recharge their battery and transmit the datum back to two large soviet antenna on earth each strip of information take eight hour to proces by computer by the end of their main mission in july of the venera have map million square kilometer million square mile thirty percent of the entire planet venera and reveal that venu ha a surface geology more complex than show by pioneer venu in the late numerou hill mountain ridge valley and plain spread acros the landscape many of them apparently form by lava from erupt volcano in the last one billion year in planetary term thi make the venerean surface rather young hundred of crater be detect a well the largest of which have to have be create by meteorite planetoid would be a better term here at least fourteen kilometer mile acros due to venu very dense atmosphere there be some disagreement between and soviet scientist on the origin of certain surface feature for example the probe owner declare that the wide crater at the summit of high maxwell monte the tallest mountain on the planet wa the result of a meteorite impact american scientist on the other hand felt the crater wa proof that maxwell wa a huge volcano sit on the northern continent of ishtar terra in any event the decide to wait on make verdict about venu until the arrival of their own radar probe schedule for later in the decade originally name the venu orbiting imaging radar voir it initial design wa scale back and the craft wa redesig nated the venu radar mapper vrm eventually the machine would be call magellan after the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan circa thi vehicle would map the entire planet in even finer detail than the venera for the time however the soviet probe maintain that distinction radar image wa not the only ability of the venera bolted next to the polyu v radar antenna be the omega altimeter and the fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measure the world temperature the majority of the area cover register about five hundred degree celsiu degree fahrenheit but a few location be two hundred degree hotter possibly indicate current volcanic activity the probe also find that the cloud over the pole be five to eight kilometer three to mile lower than at the equator in contrast the polar air above sixty kilometer thirty-six mile altitude wa five to twenty degree warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar height when the main map mission end in july of there be plan for at least one of the venera to radar image the surface at more southernly latitude unfortunately thi idea do not come to pa a the orbiter may not have possess enough attitude-control ga to perform the operation venera and cease transmission in march of leave the soviet institute of radiotechnology and electronic with six hundred kilometer mile of radar datum tape to sort into an atla of twenty-seven map of the northern hemisphere of venu venu by balloon for year the thick atmosphere of venu have be a tempt target to scientist who wish to explore the planet mantle of air with balloon-borne instrument professor jacque blamont of the french space agency centre national spatiale cne have propose such an idea a far back a only to have a joint french-soviet balloon mission cancel in nevertheles late in the year such dream would eventually come true when two proton rocket be send skyward on december and the soviet union provide western observer with the first clear full view of the booster which have be launch every soviet venu probe since thi wa but one of many first for the complex mission the unman probe launch into space that december be name vega and a contraction of the word venera and gallei gallei be the russian word for halley not only do the spacecraft have more than one mission to perform they also have more than one celestial objective to explore namely the comet halley thi famou periodic traveler wa make it latest return to the inner region of the solar system since it last visit in since it wa widely believe that comet be the icy remain from the formation of the solar system five billion year ago scientist around the world give high priority to explore one of the few such body which actually come close to earth most comet linger in the cold and dark outer fringe of the solar system some like halley be perturb by variou force and fall in toward the sun where they circle for millennium spew out ice and debris for million of kilometer from the warmth of each solar encounter the soviet union along with the european space agency esa and japan institute of space and astronautical science isa do not wish to mi out on thi first opportunity in human history to make a close examination of halley the esa would be use the cylindrical giotto probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the comet while japan first deep space craft sakigake pioneer and suisei comet would view halley from a much safer distance scientist in the united state also desire to study the comet from the vantage of a space probe at one time envision a vessel power by solar sail or ion engine however government budget cut to nasa cancel the american effort the would have to make do primarily with earth-based observation and the share of datum from other nation though an instrument name the dust counter and mas analyzer ducma design by chicago university professor john simpson wa add on the soviet mission in may of the soviet answer to halley be the vega instead of build an entirely new craft for the mission the soviet decide to modify their venera bu design to encounter the comet while perform an advance venu mission along the way a vega and reach venu the bus would drop off one each and use the ma of the shroud planet to swing them toward comet halley much a the probe mariner use venu to flyby mercury eleven year earlier the soviet craft would then head on to halley help to pinpoint the location of the comet erupt nucleu for the giotto probe to dive in only kilometer mile away in march of a plan the two vega arrive at venu in june of vega release it payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander make a two-day descent toward the planet the craft touch the upper atmosphere on the morning of june sixty-one kilometer mile above the venerean surface a small container wa release by the lander which produce a parachute at kilometer mile altitude thu the first balloon probe ever to explore venu have successfully arrive one kilometer after the open of the parachute helium ga wa pump into the teflon-coated plastic balloon inflate it to a diameter of meter foot dangling on a tether thirteen meter foot below wa the instrument package properly know a an aerostat the top part of the aerostat consist of a cone which serve a an antenna and tether attachment point to the balloon beneath it wa the transmitter electronic and instrument connected at the bottom wa a nephelometer for measure cloud particle the aerostat wa paint with a special white finish to keep at bay the corrode mist of sulfuric acid which permeate the planet atmosphere the vega balloon wa drop into the night side of venu just north of the equator scientist be concern that the ga bag would burst in the heat of daylight so they place it in the darken hemisphere to give the craft a much time a possible to return datum thi action necessitate that the lander come down in the dark a well effectively remove the camera system use on previou mission the author wonder though if they could have use floodlight similar to the one attach to venera and in when soviet scientist have think the planet surface wa enshroud in a perpetual twilight due to the permanently thick cloud cover the first balloon transmit for hour right into the day hemisphere before it lithium battery fail cover kilometer mile the threat of burst in the day heat do not materialize the vega balloon wa station at a altitude after drop ballast at fifty kilometer thirty mile for thi wa consider the most active of the three main cloud layer report by pioneer venu in indeed the balloon wa push acros the planet at speed up to kilometer mile per hmy strong vertical wind bob the craft up and down two to three hundred meter to foot through most of the journey the layer air temperature average forty degree celsiu degree fahrenheit and pressure wa a mere earth atmosphere the nephelometer could find no clear region in the surround cloud early in the first balloon flight the vega lander wa already head toward the venerean surface both lander be equip with a soil drill and analyzer similar to the one carry on venera and in however vega would become unable to report the composition of the grind at it land site in rusalka planitium the mermaid plain north of aphrodite terra while still ten to fifteen minute away from land a timer malfunction cause the drill to accidentally begin it program activity sixteen kilometer mile above the surface there wa neither any way to shut off the instrument before touchdown nor reactivate it after land thi wa unfortunate not only for the general los of datum but also for the fact that most of venu wa cover with such smooth low-level lava plain and have never before be directly examine nevertheles the surface temperature and pressure wa calculate at degree celsiu degree fahrenheit and earth atmosphere respectively during the lander minute of grind transmission a large amount of background infrared radiation wa also record at the site a have be do when the drill and camera on venera and have fail in december of the soviet focus on the datum return during the lander plunge through the atmosphere the french-soviet malachite ma spectrometer detect sulfur chlorine and possibly phosphoru it be the sulfur possibly from active volcano which gife the venerean cloud their yellowish color the sigma ga chromatograph find that every cubic meter of air between an altitude of and kilometer and mile contain one milligram grain of sulfuric acid the vega datum on the overall structure of the cloud deck appear to be at odd with the information from pioneer venu the case wa make even stronger by the fact that vega result nearly match it twin the vega find only two main cloud layer instead of the three report by the probe the layer be three to five kilometer to mile thick at altitude of and kilometer and mile the cloud persist like a thin fog until clear at an altitude of kilometer mile much lower than the pv read one possibility for the discrepan cies may have be radical structural change in the venerean air over the last seven year when the lander and balloon finally go silent the last function part of the vega mission the flyby bu sail on for a million-kilometer million-mile journey around the sun to become the first probe to meet comet halley on march the bu make a pa at the dark and icy visitor before travel on in interplanetary space the soviet have accomplish their first mission to two celestial body with one space vessel on june vega release it payload for a two-day fall toward venu like it duplicate the vega balloon radio information back to the twenty antenna track it on earth for hour before battery failure on the morning side of the planet during it flight over venu the second balloon enter in a rather still environment which become le so twenty hour into the mission after hour mission time the air become even more turbulent for a further eight hour when the balloon pass over a five kilometer three-mile mountain on the continent of aphrodite terra a powerful downdraft pull the craft kilometer mile toward the surface temperature sensor on the vega balloon report that the air layer it wa move through wa consistently degree celsiu degree fahrenheit cooler than the area explore by the vega balloon thi wa corroborate by the vega lander a it pass through the balloon level no positive indication of lightning be make by either balloon and the second aerostat nephelometer fail to function the vega lander touch down on the northern edge of aphrodite terra western arm on the fifteenth of june kilometer mile southeast of vega the lander rest place wa smoother than think indicate either a very ancient and wear surface or a relatively young one cover in fresh lava the soil drill wa in work order and report a rock type know a anorthosite-troctolite rare on earth but present in luna highland thi rock be rich in aluminum and silicon but lack in iron and magnesium a high degree of sulfur wa also present in the soil the air around vega measure degree celsiu degree fahrenheit and earth atmosphere essentially a typical day or night on venu far above the vega lander it carrier bu speed past venu at a distance of kilometer mile and follow it twin to comet halley make a closer flyby on march at just kilometer mile both probe help to reveal that the comet be a very dark and irregular-shaped ma about fourteen kilometer mile acros rotate once every hour give or take three hour since both vega craft be still function after their halley encounter soviet scientist consider an option to send the probe to other celestial object one prime target wa the near earth planetoid adoni which vega could pa at a distance of six million kilometer million mile sadly the soviet have to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it wa discover that there wa not enough maneuver fuel in the probe to reach adoni a plan vega and be quietly shut down in early future plan diverted the impressive vega mission have give some scientist numerou idea and hope for even more ambitiou expedition to the second world from the sun one example wa the vestum mission plan for the early thi soviet-french collaboration call for the launch of multiple probe on a single proton rocket in either or the craft would first swing by venu and drop off several lander and balloon probe the aerostat would be design to survive in the planet corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over the vega balloon two day the mission would then head out to investigate several planetoid and comet include a possible land on vestum thu the mission name the most reflective main belt planetoid a see from earth unfortunately for venu exploration plan begin to change in the soviet union in the soviet decide to reroute the vestum mission to the red planet mar instead of venu keep the comet and planetoid aspect intact by thi time in the soviet space program interest wa focus on mar already under construction wa an entirely new probe design call phobo two member of thi clas be plan to leave earth in and orbit mar the next year phobo and would then place the first instrument on mar largest moon phobo all thi wa a prelude to even more advance mar expedition include balloon probe rover soil sample return craft and eventually human explorer in the early twenty-first century the environment of venu wa just too hostile for any seriou consideration of human colonization in the near future but thing begin to look bleak for soviet venu and mar exploration both phobo probe fail to complete their mission one lose contact on the way to the red planet in and the other go silent in mar orbit just one week before the plan moon land in march of in a plan wa devise for a venu orbiter to drop eight to ten penetrator around the planet in several year later the mission launch date wa move to the year and ha now be put on indefinite hold no other official soviet mission to venu have since be put forth a sad commentary after twenty-five year of continuou robotic exploration of the planet during the late a drastic political and economic change wa take over the soviet union president mikhail gorbachev begin to open up hi nation to the benefit of increase cooperation with the rest of the nation particularly those in the west while the culture become le oppressive than in the past the economy wa take a very rough ride a it also undergo the effect of a free market these effect hit everywhere include the space program mission at all level be cut back the soviet begin make almost desperate attempt to cooperate with other space-faring nation either to keep their remain program alive or just to make money in early it wa report that the soviet be offer for sale several fully-equipped venera they have in storage for the price of million dollar each an incredibly low price for any planetary probe no nation take them up on the bargain meanwhile the united state wa gear up for new venu mission of their own magellan and galileo the reactivate their long-dormant planetary exploration with the launch of the space shuttle atlanti on may aboard the shuttle wa the magellan spacecraft a combination of spare part from other probe design to make the most detail and complete radar-mapping of venu in history when magellan reach the second world in august of it would be able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of meter foot surpass the ability of venera and in the interim another american probe wa launch from a space shuttle which would make a quick flyby of venu on it way to orbit the giant planet jupiter in on october the shuttle atlanti release it second unman planetary probe into space name galileo after the famou italian astronomer who discover the probe primary target major moon in in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send galileo on a direct flight to the jovian planet the probe wa send around venu and earth several time to build up enough speed to reach jupiter a a result venu become galileo first planetary goal in february of the probe radio back image of the planet swirl cloud and further indication of lightning in that violent atmosphere on the drawing board with the incredible succes of magellan in the last few year new plan have be lay out for further journey to venu scien tist in the have talk to space scientist in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent state since january of a cooperative effort to launch new venera lander mission within in the next decade japan indium and the esa have also consider their own venu mission in the next few decade in february of nasa come up with several new venu project a part of their discovery program for launch inexpensive probe throughout the solar system for venu two mission be select for further study a venu multiprobe mission involve the land of fourteen small probe over one hemisphere to measure wind air temperature and pressure and the venu composition probe design to study venu atmosphere while descend through the thick air with the aid of a parachute much a the soviet have do since final project decision will be make in human on venu will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of venu at present the lead-melting temperature and crush air pressure would be threaten to any earth life not protect in something even tougher than a venera lander plan have be look into change the environment of venu itself into something more like earth however it should be note that any such undertake will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability to speed up the planet rotation rate to something a bite faster than once every earth day such a project may take century if not millennium in the meantime effort should be make to better understand venu a it exist today we still have yet to fully know how a world so seemingly similar to earth in many important way become instead such a deadly place will earth ever suffer thi fate perhap venu hold the answer such answer may best be find through international cooperation include the nation which make the first attempt to lift the cloudy veil from venu bibliography barsukov v l senior editor venu geology geochemistry and geophysic research result from the
