from jkatz jordan katz subject ssrt roll-out speech ssrt rollout speech delivered by col simon p worden the deputy for technology sdio mcdonnell dougla huntington beach april most of you a be i be child of the we grow up in an age of miracle inter-continental ballistic missile nuclear energy computer flight to the moon but these be miracle of my parent do for a decade and more the pundit have tell u you lose it the me generation be only live on the accomplishment of the past you and i have even begin to believe the pessimist we listen in awe a the past generation tell of it triumph living history they be we be privilege to hear those who do it tell of it a few week ago some of thi very team listen in awe a general bernie schriever tell of hi team work and ye struggle to build thi nation intercontinental ballistic missile what story can we tell blurry-eyed telescope thousand dollar toilet seat even my space launch vehicle hearken only of that past great time they be and seem destine to remain gen schriever icbm i find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea be to refurbish old minuteman and poseidon ballistic missile well the pessimist be wrong the legacy be continue thi event be proof to my technological parent we listen to ymy story we catch ymy enthusiasm and can-do spirit and we learn from ymy achievement and ymy mistake let me honor one of you who wa part of that history and the impetu behind thi history max hunter you be one of the greatest engineer of the firt great age of space exploration ymy insight and discipline build the thor icbm later incorporate into today most successful launch vehicle the deltum you tell u in the that a new form of launch vehicle a single stage reusable rocket can and should be build you advocate thi idea tirelessly it wa elegantly simple a be all great breakthrough you show u how to build it you convince u it could be do you be work by my side to weld it component into place most important you remind u of a prime engineer principle undoubtably one you learn from the generation before you the generation that build transcontinental aviation in the and build a little and test a little and max you pass all of thi on to person like pat ladner who start thi program for the sdi dougla aircraft do start with a they do even start with a my grandfather build a little test a little even sell a little and make a little money before they move on to the next step they do take a decade or more before put the first rubber on the road max hunter you do take ten year to build thor and by god we not go to take ten year to show that low cost single stage reusable aerospace transportation be real we end the cold war in a few short year it take the same team here today but a few year to show through the strategic defense initiative that the cold war must end we you and u launch a series of satellite the deltum experiment in about a year apiece thi more than anything else signal my commitment to end the impasse between ourself and the soviet union those who make the decision on both side have underscore the importance of my work in bring about a new international relationship but it be the same team which be now put in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that be my legacy for the next generation we will make space acces routine and affordable we build thi magnificent fly machine in two year thi summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time then we can and surely will build in the next three year a reusable sub-orbital rocket it will allow u to use space rapidly affordably and efficiently a no other nation can and ye we make a little money off it too then and only then we spend another three year to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system the of space will be a reality we may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthrough of my former cold war adversary what a wonderful irony if thi sdi product and russian effort to counter sdi merge to power mankind next step to the star to be sure we must guard against the temptation to leap to the final answer robert goddard first rocket be saturn v if we succumb to the temptation to ask for just a few extra dollar and a few more year to jump immediately to a full orbital system we will fail max hunter and hi colleague show the way three year and a cloud of dust in my case rocket exhaust there be no short-cut if we expect to reshape the world again we must do it one brick at a time mind on task at hand thi project be real the torch of american technological greatnes be be pass we be american thi machine be american let go fly it
