lastling up to day it then return to earth and be ready for another flight with payload and flight crew the orbiter perform a variety of orbital mission include deployment and retrieval of satellite service of exist satellite operation of specialize laboratory astronomy earth science material process manufacture and other operation these mission will eventually include the development and service of a permanent space station the orbiter also provide a stag capability for use higher orbit than can be achieve by the orbiter itself user of the space shuttle capability be both domestic and foreign and include government agency and private industry the crew normally consist of five person the commander the pilot and three mission specialist on occasion additional crew member be assign the commander pilot and mission specialist be nasa astronaut pilot astronaut pilot astronaut server a both space shuttle commander and pilot during flight the commander ha onboard responsibility for the vehicle crew mission succes and safety in flight the pilot assist the commander in control and operate the vehicle in addition the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellite utilize the remote manipulator system in extra-vehicular activity and other payload operation mission specialist astronaut mission specialist astronaut work with the commander and pilot have overall responsibility for the coordination of shuttle operation in the area of crew activity plan consumable usage and experiment and payload operation mission specialist be require to have a detail
