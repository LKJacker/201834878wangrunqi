from pgf phil g fraering subject re over zealou shuttle critic khayash ken hayashida write rockwell international in downey californium in conjunction with the other shuttle contractor deliver the world most important and most revolutionary space vehicle ha one can not argue with the fact that it fly land and be reusable watch me it fly it land it get rebuild in my opinion these be the only appropriate specification for thi program that not what they tell u back in the it ha be a test program from the start a logical follow to the program and the later x-series lift body it be a logical follow-on a logical follow-on would have be either a russian snowfox type thingey for the lift body or something like mmi space van or boeing tsto or the airbreathing tsto the military be allegedly use now that probably cost le to develop than the shuttle do to fly for a year the engineer spec that the guy in the trench have be to develop a system which wa man-ratable could land reliably and could be reflown these goal be quite visionary for the and i would argue that they be challenge even today include for the dc-x program keep that attitude and it be a couple century before we get real acces to space unles another country without all that baggage come along and kick my a in the space race i do not recall a specification in the final nasa spec for the space shuttle program if you have such document i would find them most reveal and interest a far a i can tell the only person tout a flight per week flight rate be person on capitol hill or sell book to the general public or nasa hq that do give the rest of the program plausible deniability if we deceide that it wa worth the money we spend which be by now probably a lot more than apollo imho political statement in the hall of the u congres be not admissable a engineer spec because spec should be determine by and contractor not by congressman senator or president mission be define by political leader but not the engineer spec ye but it get sell on the basi of the political statement you say basically that it meet the engineer spec which be questionable imho so it a succes never mind that you could get the fund the shuttle eat with those engineer spec in a thousand year the shuttle be the only reusable space vehicle thi automatically qualify it a an unparalleled engineer succes you could argue about it political succes but engineer wise it be clearly the most advance machine ever fly i argue that engineer and technical datum for hypersonic flight be valuable in and of itself shuttle should be justify or criticize on the basi of economic you can get hypersonic flight datum with an or a follow-on type vehicle for much le and economic and engineer be interchangable engineer in the absense of economic be basically just physic and in term of physic the shuttle look like a failure next to the then henry write h sorry support that i can arrange for launcher all go to launcher h that i have some hope of rid some day at the moment that h dc-x hoped-for successor i wa disappoint by thi and other similar statement from those vocal in support of the dc-x program ymy support of dc-x be base on hope my support for the shuttle program be base on record the shuttle program ha a bad record i once have hope for the shuttle program by now i know those hope be false all i have for dc-x and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicle be hope but at least i know they be false hope yet i do support the shuttle way back when it do do nearly what it wa suppose to it time to move on to something that might do the job of orbital delivery better or at all i think that it be also important to note that i do not object to dc-x it be visionary i originally post i like the dc-x idea and i be really hopeful that it be a stun succes unfortunately be not will to return that support the prove shuttle program explain why you folk criticize shuttle when shuttle be exactly what you guy need in order to learn how to operate dc-x on-orbit we do want to learn how to operate on orbit it launch it shove out the payload it land it do waste payload haul up and down edo pallet and the like the only thing to be learn from shuttle be how not to build a launcher finally that bite about the prove shuttle are you hop you can tell a lie enough time and get someone to believe it i enjoy ymy later post regard the comparison between the shuttle and the soyuz project although i may disagree with ymy method of analysi you probably will disagree with mine i think that the total impact of the shuttle program must be judge on the scientific and technical merit not on timeline and schedule do you agree how much science and technology could have be do be the money spend on shuttle have be spend differently a for now we need to stop think of dc-x and shuttle a mutually exclusive learn about economic and the current budget reality in the united state please thank for ymy time phil fraering number one good
