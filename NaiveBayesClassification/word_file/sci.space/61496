from palmer david m palmer subject re hst servicing mission scheduled for day prb pat write in article henry henry spencer write no the thing be design to be retrievable in a pinch indeed thi dictate a rather odd design for the solar array since they have to be retractable a well a extendable and may thu have indirectly contribute to the array-flapping problem why not design the solar array to be detachable if the shuttle be go to retunr the hst what bother be some array just fit them with a quick release one space walk or use the second canadarm to remove the array you may want to put hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost and you do want to clip off the panel each time for the gamma-ray observatory one of the design requirement wa that there be no stored-energy mecahnism spring explosive squib ga shock etc use for deployment thi wa partially so that everything could be reel back in to put it back in the payload bay and partially for safety consideration i hear that the wing on a cruise missile would cut you in half if you be stand in their swath when they open back when the shuttle would be go up every other day with a cost to orbit of per pound everybody design thing for easy service david m palmer palmer palmer
