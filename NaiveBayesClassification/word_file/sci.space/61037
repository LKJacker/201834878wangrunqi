from amruth laxman subject surviving large acceleration hi i wa read through the spaceflight handbook and somewhere in there the author discus solar sail and the force act on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by pass close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit the magnitude of such acceleration he estimate to be on the order of he also say that thi be may not be a big problem for man craft because human and thi wa publish in have already withstand acceleration of all thi be very long-winded but here my question finally are acceleration in fact humanly tolerable with the aid of any mechanical device of course if these be possible what be use to absorb the acceleration can thi be extend to larger acceleration thank be advance amruth laxman
