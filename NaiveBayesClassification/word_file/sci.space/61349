from ethanb ethan bradford subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article jbatka write i assume that can only be guess at by the assume energy of the event and the law so if the law be incorrect assume some unknown material dark matter inhibit gamma ray propagation could it be possible that we be actually see much le energetic event happen much closer to u the even distribution could be cause by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma ray be shorter then the thicknes of the disk of the galaxy i believe the problem with thi theory be that we see gamma-ray source at that energy range and their energy do seem to be significantly absorb
