from collin steve collin subject re orbital repairstation the difficulty of a high isp otv include long transfer time radiation damage from vanallen belt for both the spacecraft and otv arcjet or xenon thruster require huge amount of power so you have to have either nuclear power source messy dangerou and source of radiation damage or big solar array sensitive to radiation or heavy that make attitude control and dock a big pain if you go solar you have to replace the array every trip with current technology nuclear power source be strongly restrict by international treaty refueling even for very high isp like xenon be still require and turn out to be a pain you either have to develop autonomou rendezvou or long range teleoperation to do dock or and refuel you still ca do much plane change because the deltav require be so high the air force continue to look at do thing thi way though i suppose they be bid their time till the technology become available and the problem get solve not impossible in principle but hard to do and marginally cheaper than one shoot rocket at least today just a few random think on high isp otv i design one once steve collin
