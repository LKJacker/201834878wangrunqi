from baalke ron baalke subject galileo update forwarded from neal ausman galileo mission director galileo mission director statu report post-launch april spacecraft on april and deltum differenced one-way range dor pas be perform over meter antenna and meter antenna respectively initial result indicate the deltum dor pa on april wa unsuccessful due to grind station hardware problem but the one on april wa successfully perform on april a cruise science memory readout mro wa perform for the magnetometer mag instrument analysi indicate the datum wa receive properly on april the spare power relay contact be command close vium the spacecraft store sequence these relay be command close by the cd command datum subsystem prior to launch and be again command close to preclude the possibility at jupiter of the pp be a source of internal electrostatic charge iesd on april cruise science memory readout mro be perform for the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer euv dust detector dd and magnetometer mag instrument preliminary analysi indicate the datum wa receive properly during the period from april to april a navigation cycle wa perform thi navigation cycle provide near-continuou acquisition of two-way doppler and range datum during three consecutive pas of the spacecraft over and on april real-time command be send to test slew the radio relay antenna rra in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on april the rra wa slew from approximately degree from stow to approximately degree preliminary analysi indicate the antenna slew to about degree which wa well within the predict range the rra wa command back to approximately degree from stow preliminary analysi indicate the antenna reach about degree also well within the predict range the rra motor temperature wa at degree c at the start of the activity and have increase to degree c at it completion after verify proper rra slew the rra slew test mini-sequence wa uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on april upon successful uplink a delayed action command dac wa send which will reposition the stator on may to it initial pre-test position also a dac wa send to turn the two-way noncoherent twnc on april prior to the start of the rra slew test mini-sequence on april a no-op command wa send to reset the command los timer to hour it plan value during thi mission phase on april the rra slew test execute nominally the spacecraft under store sequence control perform six rra slew start at about degree from stow and go to degree back to degree then to degree back to degree then to degree and then back to degree all of the slew be well within the predict range the rra motor temperature wa at degree c at the start of the activity and have increase to degree c at it completion after completion of the rra slew real-time command be send to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration the bu imbalance measurement have not exhibit significant change greater than dn throughout thi period the ac measurement read dn volt the dc measurement read dn volt these measurement be consistent with the model develop by the special anomaly team the spacecraft statu a of april be a follow a system power margin watt b spin configuration dual-spin c spin scanner d spacecraft attitude be approximately degree off-sun lag and degree off-earth lead e downlink telemetry cod f general thermal control all temperature within acceptable range g rpm tank pressure all within acceptable range h orbiter science instrument power on be the pw euv uv epd mag hic and dd i power off temperature within acceptable range j cmd los timer setting hour time to initiation hour gd ground datum system the first galileo-gd test of the mgd command system cmd take place april with madrid meter antenna the test go well and demonstrate that the new command system interfaced with the new dsn deep space network group command processor assembly cpa the test wa successful and the next test for cmd be schedule for may with goldstone meter antenna the april system engineer monthly report semr ground system development office gsdo mmr wa conduct thursday april a review of current project and institutional dsn and moso system statu wa conduct on-going cruise development plu the gsdo phase and delivery schedule past month accomplishment and potential problem area be discuss no significant schedule change or significant problem be report trajectory a of noon thursday april the galileo spacecraft trajectory statu wa a follow distance from earth km au distance from sun km au heliocentric speed km per hmy distance from jupiter km round trip light time minute second special topic a of april a total of real-time command have be transmit to galileo since launch of these be initiate in the sequence design proces and initiate in the real-time command proces in the past week real time command be transmit be initiate in the sequence design proces and one initiate in the real time command proces major command activity include command to perform the initial rra slew test uplink the rra slew test mini-sequence dac to reposition the stator and turn the twnc on reset the command los timer and execute
