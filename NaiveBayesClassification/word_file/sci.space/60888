from wmiler wyatt miler subject diaspar virtual reality network announcement posted to the internet by wmiler the lunar tele-operation model one by david h mitchell march introduction in order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operation a real miniature lunar-like environment be be construct on which to test tele-operated model these model be remotely-controlled by individual locate world-wide use their personal computer for edutainment purpose not only do thi provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activity but it also provide for the share of information on method of operate in space include but not limit to layout of a lunar colony tele-operating machine for work and play disseminate educational information provide contest and award for creativity and achievement and provide a new way for student worldwide to participate in twenty-first century remote learn method because of the nature of the project person of all age interest and skill can contribute scenery and mural model and structure interfacing and electronic software and graphic in operation be an evolve playground and laboratory that can be use by child student and professional worldwide using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participate institution a user be able to tele-operate real model at the base for experimental or recreational purpose because a real facility exist ample opportunity be provide for medium coverage of the construction of the lunar model it operation and new feature to be add a suggest by the user themself thi ha broad inherent interest for a wide range of group tele-operation and virtual reality research radio control model railroad and ham radio operation astronomy and space planetarium and science center art and theater bb and online network user software and game developer manufacturer and retailer of model rocket car and train child the child in all of u overall design a room foot by foot contain the base lunar layout the wall be use for mural of distant moon mountain star field and a view of the earth the floor be the simulate lunar surface a global call for contribution be hereby make for material for the lunar surface and for the design and creation of scale model of lunar colony element scenery and machine-let the initial design ha tele-operated machinelet an ssto scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and a moon-train which will traverse most of the simulate lunar surface each machinelet ha a small tv camera utilize a ccd tv chip mount on it a personal computer digitize the image include reduce picture content and do data-compression to allow for minimal image to be send to the operator for control purpose and also return control signal the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model train with tv camera build in be almost off-the-shelf item and control electronic for start and stop a train be minimal the user will receive an image once every to second depend on the speed of their datum link to next an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspend from a servo-motor operate wire frame mount on the ceiling allow for the ssto to be control by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land finally some tank model will be modify to be ccd tv chip equip bulldozerlet the entire initial will allow remote operator worldwide to receive minimal image while actually operate model for land and takeoff travel and do work the entire system be base on commercially available item and part that can be easily obtain except for the interface electronic which be well within the capability of many advance ham radio operator and computer developer by take a graphically orient communication program dmodem and add a tele-operation screen and control the necessary user interface can be provide in under man hour plan of action the diaspar virtual reality network ha agree to sponsor thi project by provide a host computer network and internet acces to that network diaspar be provide the foot by foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model diaspar ha in stock the electronic tank that can be modify and one ccd tv chip diaspar also agree to provide rail stock for the lunar train model diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communication package and modify it for control of the machines-let an initial grind break with miniature shovel will be perform for a live photo-session and news conference on april the initial model will be put in place a time-lapse record will be start for historical purpose it be not expect that thi event will be completely seriou or solemn the lunar colony will be declare open for additional build operation and experiment a photographer will be present and the photograph take will be convert to gif image for distribution world-wide to major online network and bb a pres release will be issue call for contribution of idea time talent material and scale model for the simulate lunar colony a contest for new design and technique for work on the moon will then be announce university will be invite to participate the goal be to find instructor who wish to have clas participation in variou aspect of the lunar colony model field trip to can be arrange and at that time the result of the clas work will be add to the model contributor will then be able to tele-operate any contribute machine-let once they return to their campu a monthly newsletter will be issue both electronically online and vium conventional mean to the medium any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be mark with an invitation to the television news medium having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the action will be control by person all over the world science fiction writer will be invite to issue challenge to engineer and human factor student at university to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar task using counter-weight and pulley system gravity may be simulate to some extent to try variou traction challenge the long term goal be create world-wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony ha the potential of be a long term global edutainment method for space activity and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject area not limit to space edutainment all of thi facilitate the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of person who be ready for the leap to the star conclusion edutainment be the blend of education and entertainment anyone who ha ever enjoy see miniature will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purpose by create a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity but also a method of try new idea that require real not virtual skill and open a new method for put person mind in space moonlighter illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development the follow person be already engage in variou part of thi work dash hyson vril wyatt the dark one tiggertoo the mad hatter sir robin jogden come join the discussion any friday night from to midnight pst in diaspar virtual reality network idea welcome internet telnet to or voice email inquiry to project leader jzer or directly to on diaspar
