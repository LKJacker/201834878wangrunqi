from goltz jame p goltz subject orion drive in vacuum how background the orion spacedrive wa a theoretical concept it would be a drive use thermonuclear explosion to drive a spacecraft the idea wa that you detonate device with somewhere from one to ten megaton yield behind a pusher plate attach to the main spacecraft the shock wave from the explosion would transfer momentum to the ship now in an atmosphere i can see thi the energy of the explosion heat the atmosphere which expand explosively and slam a shock wave into the pusher plate but in a vacuum only two thing i can see be go to hit the plate product barium krypton helium neutron evaporate bomb case and electromagnetic radiation gamma mostly some from irradiate fission product would thi work i ca see the em radiation impel very much momentum especially give the ma of the pusher plate and it seem to me you go to get more momentum transfer throw the bomb out the back of the ship than you get from detonate them once they there i must be miss something would someone enlighten me vium email thank jim jim goltz alternet engineer goltz
