from claudio oliveira egalon subject re japanese moon land there be no such thing a a stable lunar orbit is it right that be new stuff for me so it mean that you just can not put a sattellite around around the moon for too long because it orbit will be unstable if so what be the reason is that because the combine gravitacional atraction of the sun moon and earth that do not provide a stable orbit around the moon claudio oliveira egalon
