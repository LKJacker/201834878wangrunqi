from zellner subject re hst servicing mission in article bday brian day write rdougla rob dougla write but try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the back and you could have problem the shuttle just be design to land with that much weight in the payload is hst really that much heavier than a spacelab i hate to belabor the obviou once again but if there have be an orbiter emergency in the early stage of the original hst deployment mission they would have had to land with hst in the bay indeed they be worry about that one concern wa the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up and make orbit but one that wa too low to give hst a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag i believe the decision wa to deploy hst even if the project lifetime wa a short a six month in fact we get an excellent orbit on the upper envelope of what the shuttle can do i have never hear of any seriou consideration that hst might be bring down for refurbishment you would have the horrendou cost of transport clean re-testing and re-certifying all the hardware on the grind in addition to the lose observe time and the cost of a second deployment mission with the risk that we might not get such a good orbit the second time and you would probably still need a third service mission in a few year a gyro and other component wear out better to have two service mission in space which could well happen than to bring hst down and take it up again ben
