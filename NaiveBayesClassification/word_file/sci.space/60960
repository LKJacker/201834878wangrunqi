from jgreen jame thoma green subject keeping spacecraft on after funding cut why do spacecraft have to be shut off after fund cut for example why could magellan just be tell to go into a safe mode and stay bob about venu in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few year if fund get restore after the economy get better hopefully it could be turn on again for that matter why exactly be the apollo lunar experiment turn off rather than just safed wa it political a along a they could be use someone would keep bug congres for fund turning them off keep them pesky scientist out of the bureaucrat hair i hear the argument that an active but uncontrolled spacecraft cause radio noise i find that hard to believe that thi could be a problem in a properly design safe mode thi safe mode could be a program routine which cause the spacecraft to go to least fuel use orientation and once a week month year whatever attempt a signal lock on earth at that time if fund ha be restore the mission can continue if no signal be recieved the spacecraft go back to the safe mode for another time period a we would know when the spacecraft be go to try to contact earth we could be prepare if necessary a another a spacecraft could do at the attempt contact be beam store datum toward earth if someone can receive it great if not so it lose and no big deal by make the time and signal location generally know perhap someone in the world might be able and will to intercept the datum even if they not will to contact the spacecraft i see thi a be particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and be in or be go to place which be otherwise unaccessible orbit exit the solar system etc perhap those design future spacecraft cassini pluto flyby etc should consider design in a pause mode in case their spacecraft get the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission perhap mar observer and galilleo could have some kind of routine write in for the post mission drift phase so any hole in all thi jame t green jgreen i believe that thi nation should commit itself to achieve the goal before thi decade be out of land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth john f kennedy may
