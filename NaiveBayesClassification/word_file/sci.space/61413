from richmond stupendou man subject interstellar t be note on talk and pluto mission reader can skip the first paragraph yesterday in response to henry spencer question about the temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space i say dust grain act a blackbody and they at k well i wa dead wrong my local interstellar dust expert bruce draine ha inform me that dust grain good radiator in the far ir which be why they be so warm actually the ambient radiation field from distant star can bring a true blackbody to only or kelvin sorry henry and anyone else i mislead obviously time for me to take another ism clas in other news alan stern of the southwest research institute give a talk on the pluto-charon binary system yesterday he give a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameter volume ratio of about ma ratio about or so plu lot more and then give hi think on the formation of pluto-charon hi idea be that there be lot and lot of small planetesimal in the outer solar system with mass distribute a a power law of some kind over time the planetesimal accrete into larger body most get scatter out of the solar system by close encounter with jupiter and saturn but many accrete into the ga giant especially uranu and neptune a large planetesimal wa capture by neptune we call it triton capture how perhap by a collision with a smaller already-existing neptunian moon perhap by a very close passage through neptune atmosphere mondo aerobraking he note that the two recently discover kuiper belt object and fw plu chiron and pholu be all about the same ma and he identify thi group a one-accretion-down from the larger body of triton and he think form when an impact body hit proto-pluto knock some material into a ring around pluto which later accrete in charon similar to idea about the formation of earth moon there be good evidence from spectrum that the surface of pluto and charon be very different pluto ha methane frost charon do which can be use a evidence for the impact theory he believe that there may be around pluto-to-chiron-sized object remain in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside neptune orbit beyond au or so and fw be the first member of thi population to be find in hi model note that such body will be very dark since if their surface be cover with methane frost it will have photolyzed into very dark long-chain hydrocarbon by now the reason that pluto ha such a high albedo around i think be that it surface warm up just enough around perihelion to sublimate and when the atmosphere freeze out again thirty year later it form bright new frost so any body much farther away than au be go to be very hard to see i hope i have make any error in the transcription if you see a howl mistake it undoubtedly mine not hi by the way he one of the top gun behind the pluto fast flyby mission i think and say that the current plan be to use a titan to send the probe on just about a rectilinear trajectory to pluto we be speak loosely at the time he like to use a proton which gife a slightly smaller velocity but cost much le hi figure million for titan launch there will be two separate probe launch separately or million for proton launch he tell a story about how the soviet originally offer to sell proton launch for million each but be force to increase their price in the u in order to be allow in the marketplace i just tell you what he say michael michael richmond thi be the heart that break my finger richmond
