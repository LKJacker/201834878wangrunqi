from wingert bret wingert subject re level in henry spencer write in article mccall fred j mccall write give that i hear the shuttle software rat a level level out of how many also keep in mind that it wa not achieve through the use of sophisticate tool but rather through a force and ignorance attack on the problem during the challenger standdown they simply throw hundred of person at it and do the whole proces by hand i think thi be a little inaccurate base on feynman account of the software-development proces before the standdown fred be basically correct no sophisticate tool just a lot of effort and painstaking care but they get thi one right before challenger feynman cite the software person a exemplary compare to the engine person he also note that the software person be start to feel management pressure to cut corner but have have to give in to it much yet among other thing the software person work very hard to get thing right for the major pre-flight simulation and consider a failure during those simulation to be nearly a bad a an in-flight failure a a result the number of major-simulation failure could be count on one hand and the number of in-flight failure wa zero a fred mention elsewhere thi apply only to the flight software software that run experiment be typically mostly put together by the experimenter and get nowhere near the same level of tender loving care none of the experimenter could afford it all work be one man work henry spencer u of toronto zoology kipling henry utzoo henry news-software ureply x-x-from wingert bret wingert reference in henry spencer write in article mccall fred j mccall write give that i hear the shuttle software rat a level level out of how many also keep in mind that it wa not achieve through the use of sophisticate tool but rather through a force and ignorance attack on the problem during the challenger standdown they simply throw hundred of person at it and do the whole proces by hand i think thi be a little inaccurate base on feynman account of the software-development proces before the standdown fred be basically correct no sophisticate tool just a lot of effort and painstaking care but they get thi one right before challenger feynman cite the software person a exemplary compare to the engine person he also note that the software person be start to feel management pressure to cut corner but have have to give in to it much yet a fred mention elsewhere thi apply only to the flight software software that run experiment be typically mostly put together by the experimenter and get nowhere near the same level of tender loving care a couple of point on thi thread we have be use my process since way before challenger challenger in and of it self do not uncover flaw what mr spencer say be by and large true we have a proces that be not dependent on sophisticate tool case tool however tool can not fix a bad proces also tool support for the shuttle language be somewhat limit the onboard flight software project wa rat level by a nasa team thi group generate ksloc of verify code per year for nasa feel free to call me if you or ymy organization be interest in more info on my software development proces bret wingert fax bret wingert fax
