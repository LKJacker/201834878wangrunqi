from eder dani eder subject re gun for space in reference to the limit of acceleration with gun launch solid rocket a payload thiokol provide me with sample and datum on a reinforcement to solid motor grain for high acceleration solid motor propellant usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix for example the space shuttle srb be percent aluminum the technique be to use a aluminum structure the structure look like the inverse of a set of bubble an i suspect some bubble proces be use to form it in other word if you make a bunch of bubble in melt aluminum then freeze it thi be what you get it form a strong network of effectively aluminum wire in all direction the remain solid fuel mix be infiltrate into the void and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant the foamed-aluminum make up about percent of the total propellant so there be still aluminum particle in the bulk grain the major improvement be the higher resistance to grain crack which be the principal failure mode for solid propellant dani eder dani investment company w h box athen al n w alt
