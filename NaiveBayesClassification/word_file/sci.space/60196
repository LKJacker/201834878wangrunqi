from mccall fred j mccall subject re nuclear waste in dietz paul dietz write in article mccall fred j mccall write thi system would produce enough energy to drive the accelerator perhap with some leave over a very high power of mw cw or quasi cw very sharp proton beam would be require but thi appear achievable use a linear accelerator the biggest question mark would be the lead target chemistry and the on-line process of all the element be incinerate paul quite frankly i believe that thi be really go to work on the typical trash one need to proces when i see them put a couple ton in one end and get relatively clean material out the other end plu be able to run it off it own residual power sound almost like perpetual motion do it fred the honest thing to do would be to admit ymy criticism on scientific grind wa invalid rather than pretend you be actually talk about engineer feasibility given you post i ca say i be surprise though well pardon me for try to continue the discussion rather than just tug my forelock in dismay at have not consider actually try to recover the energy from thi proces which be at least try to go the way on the energy curve now where do i put those sackcloth and ash i wa not and be not anything i be so please you be not surprise though no it be nothing like perpetual motion note that i do say it wa perpetual motion or even that it sound like perpetual motion the phrase wa sound almost like perpetual motion which i at least consider a somewhat different propposition than the one you elect to criticize perhap i should beg ymy pardon for be too precise in my use of language the physic be well understand the energy come from fission of actinide in subcritical assembly folk have talk about spallation reactor since the pulsed spallation neutron source be in use today a research tool accelerator design ha be improve particularly with superconducting accelerate cavity which help feasibility lo alamo ha expertise in high current accelerator lampf so i believe they know what they be talk about i will believe that thi proces come even close to approach technological and economic feasibility give the mix nature of the trash that will have to be run through it a oppose to the cost of separate thing first and have a different for each actinide when i see them dump a few ton in one end and pull relatively clean material out the other once the cost technological risk etc be take into account i still clas thi one with the idea of throw waste into the sun sure it possible and the physic be well understand but be it really a reasonable approach and i still wonder at what sort of rate you could get with something like thi a oppose to what kind of energy you would really recover a oppose to what it would cost to build and power with and without the energy recovery are we talk ounce pound or ton gram kilogram or metric ton for you si fan of material and be we talk day week month or year day week month or year for you si fan hmmm still use a non-decimated time scale i see the real reason why accelerator breeder or incinerator be not be build be that there be any reason to do so natural uranium be still too cheap and geological disposal of actinide look technically reasonable insisting on perfect safety be for person who do have the ball to live in the real world mary shafer nasa ame dryden i do speak for other and they do speak for me
