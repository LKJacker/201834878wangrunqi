from khayash ken hayashida subject re what planet be habitable in article jpg jonathan p gibbon write i would appreciate any think on what make a planet habitable for human i be make asumption that life and a similar atmosphere evolve give a range of physical aspect of the planet the question be what physical aspect simply disallow earth like condition eg temperature range of to where temp be purely dependant on dist from the sun and the sun temperature atmospheric presure i know nothing of human tolerance planetary mas again gravity at surface be important how much can human body take day after day also how do the ma effect atmosphere i think of planet between and time ma of the earth i suppose density should be important a well climate etc do not concern me nor do axial tilt etc etc just the above three factor and how they relate to one another jonathan jonathan interest question some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever support an atmosphere i be interest in know what my science friend think a for human tolerance the best example of human endurance in term of altitude low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure be in my opinion to the scale of mt everest without oxygen assistance thi wa accomplish by a team of mountaineer who train at high altitude for quite awhile i think a few month and then be fly by helicopter from that train altitude to the equivalent altitude on mount everest where they begin the ascent of my planet highest peak without oxygen tank thi be quite a feat of physiological endurance because if you or i try to go to foot and exert ourself we would probably pa out get altitude sick and could even die from cerebral edema so thi be the limit of low pressure high pressure situation would be limit by the duration of time which it take to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure skin diver would know alot about high pressure situation and could tell you about how they safely make deep dife without get the bend some military experiment have put person under several atmosphere of pressure not sure what the high limit wa because the paper be in front of me usually at a certain point the nitrogen in the air become toxic to the body and you start act idiotic diver call thi nitrogen narcosi those afflict can do very dangerou and irrational thing like take off a dive mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at foot under water hope any dive folk can elaborate on thi matter a i be not a dive expert mar can not support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere be too thin th my earth atmospheric density in addition the mar atmosphere be mostly carbon dioxide basically you would need a pressure suit there or you die from the low pressure interesting huh ken khayash
