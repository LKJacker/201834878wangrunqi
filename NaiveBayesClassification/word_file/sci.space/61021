from baalke ron baalke subject eclipse forwarded from john spencer spencer there will be two eclipse of iapetu by saturn and it ring in may and july please spread the word here some information about the event and then a couple of message from jay goguen of jpl appeal for thermal observation of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal property of iapetu he might also have some money available john spencer iapetu will be eclipse by the shadow of saturn ring and saturn itself on ut and again on ut timing be a follow may a-ring ingres egres b-ring ingres egres c-ring egres saturn ingres egres b-ring ingres egres a-ring ingres egres july saturn ingres egres a-ring ingres graze egres time could be minute later accord to an alternate ephemeri and photometric observation be important for refine iapetu orbit because the sun size project on the ring a see from iapetu be km it unlikely that we will learn anything new about the ring themself from the observation see soma astronomy and astrophysic for more detail thank to andy odell of northern arizona university for bring the event to my attention thermal observation jay goguen jdg write to me the interest thing to do would be thermal ir of the july disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertium etc unfortunately the ut of thi event render it inaccessible except from russium even from calar alto saturn be rise through airmass at ut do you know anyone in russium or ukraine with a big telescope and um instrumentation that look for something to do i be will to make a personal grant of for the datum jay and again please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetu planet disappearance to do so at thermal wavelength my impression would be that it not an easy observation iapetu will be faint and get fainter in eclipse so you need a big telescope that a good ir telescope and reasonable um instrumentation i do think that combination be widely available at the longitude that be well place for observation we need sofium for thi one one possibility would be the ir telescope in indium but it only a m jay ron baalke baalke jet propulsion lab telo the aweto from new zealand pasadena ca be part caterpillar and part vegetable
