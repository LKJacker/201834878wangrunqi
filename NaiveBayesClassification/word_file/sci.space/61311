from steinly steinn sigurdsson subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article keithh keith harwood write in article palmer david m palmer write prb pat write what evidence indicate that gamma ray burster be very far away given the enormou power i wa just wonder what if they be quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic range david gife good explaination of the deduction from the isotropic distribution to whit they be either part of the universe or part of the oort cloud why could they be earth centre with the edge occur at the edge of the gravisphere i know there be any mechanism for them but there be a mechanism for the other either what on earth be the gravisphere anyway before it decay the pioneer venu orbiter have a gamma ray detector a do ulyss they detect the brightest burst that the earth orbit detector do so the burst be at least at oort cloud distance in principle fmy detector space out by a few au would see parallax if the burst be of solar system origin the problem with oort cloud source be that absolutely no plausible mechanism ha be propose it would have to involve new physic a far a i can tell closest to conventional oort source be a model of b-field pinch by comet it get too many hole in it to count but at least it wa a good try steinn sigurdsson lick observatory steinly standard disclaimer the law of gravity be very very strict and you just bend them for ymy own benefit
