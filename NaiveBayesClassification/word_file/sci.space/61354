from dietz paul dietz subject re gamma ray burster positional stuff in article belgarath write get at here thi puppy be far enough away that if a bright burst happen nearby the huge annulu create by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle give by batse and we can get a moderately accurate position say oh or degree that be the closest anyone ha ever get with it you can do a whole hell of a lot better than or degree with the differential time measurement from the interplanetary network ignore the directional information from batse just look at the time of arrival with three detector properly arrange one can often get position down to arc minute btw about oort cloud source should thi be testable in the fairly near future some of the grb have very short rise time m we could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a distance of on the order of t c where b be the detector space and t the time resolution for t m and b au thi be on the order of light year i understand statistic will reduce thi number considerably a would geometry if the burst be come from the wrong direction paul
