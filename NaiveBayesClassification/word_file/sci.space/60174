from nsmca subject re dc-x vehicle near flight test in article henry henry spencer write in article snap paj paul johnson write thi bite interest me how much automatic control be there is it purely autonomou or be there some degree of grind control the stick-and-rudder man be alway the onboard computer the computer normally get it order from a store program but they can be override from the grind how be the transition from aerodynamic flight if that what it be to hover accomplish thi be the really new part it also one of the tricky part there be fmy different idea and dc-x will probably end up try all of them thi be from talk to mitch burnside clapp who one of the dc-x test pilot at making orbit pop a drogue chute from the nose light the engine once the thing stabilize base-first simple and reliable heavy shock load on an area of structure that do otherwise carry major load need a door in the hot part of the structure a door whose operation be mission-critical switch off pitch stability the dc be aerodynamically unstable at subsonic speed wait for it to flip and catch it at degree then light engine a bite scary light the engine and use thrust vectoring to push the tail around probably the prefer method in the long run tricky because of the fuel-feed plumb the fuel will start off in the top of the tank then slop down to the bottom during the flip keeping the engine properly feed will be complicate build up speed in a dive then pull up hard lose a lot of speed thi thing be not that great until it head up and the vertical velocity drop to zero at which point it start to fall tail-first light engine also a bite scary and you probably do have enough altitude leave to try again all work be one man work henry spencer u of toronto zoology kipling henry utzoo henry since the dc-x be to take off horizontal why not land that way why do the martian landing thing or be i miss something do know to much about dc-x and such overly obviou why not just fall to earth like the russian craft parachute in then michael adam nsmca i not high just jack please enlighten me ignorance be easy to correct make a mistake and everyone will let you know you mess up
