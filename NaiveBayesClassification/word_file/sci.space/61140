from baalke ron baalke subject sirtf mission be still alive from the jpl universe april sirtf be still very much in busines by mark whalen in these time of extra-tight nasa budget the very survival of a number of mission ha be uncertain but thank to major design refinement implement in recent month jpl space infrared telescope facility sirtf a major project consider to be in trouble a couple of year ago be alive and well accord to project scientist michael werner a lighter spacecraft revise orbit and shorter mission have add up to a le expensive project with tremendou scientific power and a bright future say werner designed a a follow-up to the highly successful infrared astronomical satellite ira and cosmic background explorer cobe mission sirtf a cryogenically cool observatory for infrared astronomy from space be schedule for launch in or if plan proceed a schedule ira pioneer work in space-based infrared astronomy year ago allow astronomer to view the milky way a never before and reveal among other thing galaxy and comet it provide a sky survey time more sensitive than any previously available from ground-based observation cobe ha measure the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scale and reveal new fact about the early universe but to illuminate sirtf potential jim evan jpl manager of astrophysic and fundamental physic pre-project recently say that the project be to million time more capable than ira base on technological advance in infrared detector array however despite the enormou stride in infrared exploration sirtf promise and the fact that it wa cite a the highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the by the national academy of science it take a diet or die directive from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project go accord to werner the project be now know a atla sirtf base on the key factor in it new design the satellite will orbit the sun instead of the earth permit the use of an atla rocket launch instead of the formerly propose and heavier titan the main advantage of the solar orbit be that you can use all of ymy launch capability for boost the payload you do have to carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit werner say the other advantage to a solar orbit he say be that it in a better thermal environment away from the heat of the earth additional major change in sirtf redesign include shorten the mission from five to three year and build a spacecraft that be le than half a heavy a in the original plan atla sirtf will weigh kilogram pound compare to titan sirtf kilogram pound all of that add up to a le stressful launch environment werner say and a cost save of more than million for the launch in addition to increase save in the design of the smaller le massive spacecraft werner say sirtf redesign come a a result of congres tell nasa you try to do too many thing if you want u to support sirtf which be a good project develop a plan to see how it fit into nasa overall strategy shortly thereafter sirtf wa name a nasa highest priority flagship scientific mission by the interdisciplinary space science advisory committee in addition to the bless from the national academy of science while the spacecraft and it instrument require descoping to keep the project alive sirtf major scientific contribution alway promise to come about from it advance infrared detector array which will allow image to be develop ten of thousand of time faster than before accord to evan up until a couple of year ago werner say all infrared astronomy wa do with single detector or very small array of individually assemble detector since then the department of defense ha develop a program to produce array of ten or hundred of thousand of detector rather than just a few and those be very well suit for use on sirtf werner note that in addition to deal with budget pressure congres be currently watch nasa project with an eye out for any technological spinoff on that question i think we have some thing to say he say because the detector we use be straight off variou military development also sirtf will be build by the aerospace industry and it a real technological and engineer challenge in addition to be a tremendou scientific project sirtf will be use by the entire astronomical community werner add but the revise three-year mission put a premium on observe time we have to educate the user community and develop a program that involf early survey and quick turnaround of the datum werner say the downsize of the project require a reduction in scope and complexity of sirtf three instrument the infrared spectrograph infrared array camera and multiband image photometer however these reduction will only result in loss of efficiency rather than capability he say the project hope to start a phase b activity in which will provide a detail concept for development and design building the hardware would begin about two year later projected cost estimate evan say be million million i be very optimistic about sirtf he say it will provide a tremendou return for the investment werner add that an additional benefit from the project will be the enrichment of my intellectual and cultural environment person on the street be very interest in astronomy black hole the possibility of life on other planet the origin of the universe and those be the kind of question sirtf will help answer ron baalke baalke jet propulsion lab telo the aweto from new zealand pasadena ca be part caterpillar and part vegetable
