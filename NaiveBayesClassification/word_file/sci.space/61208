from subject space advertising of two development have bring these type of activity back to the forefront in first in february the russian deploy a reflector from a progress vehicle after it have depart from the mir space station while thi banner reflector wa blank npo energium wa very active in report that future banner reflector will be available to advertiser who could use a space base video of their logo or ad print on the banner in a tv commercial a film from the mir the second development ha be that space marketing inc the same company responsible for merchandise space on the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft be now push the environmental billboard a lay out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the university of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the lawrence livermore national laboratory the environmental billboard be a large inflatable outer support structure of up to meter advertising be carry by a mylar reflective area deploy by the inflatable to help sell the concept the spacecraft responsible for maintain the billboard on orbit will carry ozone read sensor to continuously monitor the condition of the earth delicate protective ozone layer accord to mike lawson head of smi furthermore the inflatable billboard ha reach it minimum exposure of day it will be release to re-enter the earth atmosphere according to imi a the biodegradable material burn it will release ozone-building component that will literally replenish the ozone layer the remain spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it too re-enter and burn up and add to the ozone supply thi would not be a cheap advertisement cost at least several million of dollar exact cost be not available but smi estimate that market exposure would be that of the person who watch the superbowl where a advertise cost since smi be locate in atlantum georgia it be be promote a be available in time for the open of the summer olympic in atlantum but back to brian question and do anyone have any more detail other than what wa in the wn news blip how seriou be thi project is thi just in the wild idea stage or do it have real fund see above a for seriou if they can get m or so my estimate of for development cost and a flight unit plu m for a launch then it probably real they be claim to tailor the orbit to overfly specific location at specific time for optimum advertise impact so they probably ca piggy back upon someone else plan launch and will have to buy a dedicate launch that a m cost they need to raise right there and there will probably be some legal challenge to thi a well note there be one potential legal challenge to smi on the use of launch vehicle advertise already while i do think the legal challenge would win out and ye i be an amateur astronomer and no i do really like the idea of thi additional light pollution but i know of no prohibition of it the legal challenge and court fight would probably remove any positive aspect of the advertise i can imagine several way to make the advertiser look like lout for do thi which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure and negate the space advertise advantage would you spend m to look like an idiot and light pollution might not be too bad if it in a low enough orbit and it rely upon reflect light only it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn for maximum market exposure you want to have it visible just after dusk minimize impact on astronomy since that the time of worse see due to thermal turbulence it might still be a problem but perhap there be way to mitigate thi a for have real fund none that i can identify there be about expression of interest make on the conestoga advertise opportunity but that include curiou folk and wa for only a commitment i have hear of any seriou fund for thi but i sure they be shop the venture around look for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more but i be confident there be no firm or pay customer at thi time and if anybody want to cross-post thi to please be my guest i do have post privilege to that area or at least i do think i do wale larrison space technology investor maximu
