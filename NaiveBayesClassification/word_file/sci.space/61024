from abdkw stdvax david ward subject re keeping spacecraft on after funding cut in article baalke ron baalke write in article jgreen jame thoma green write why do spacecraft have to be shut off after fund cut for example why could magellan just be tell to go into a safe mode and stay bob about venu in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few year if fund get restore after the economy get better hopefully it could be turn on again it can be but the problem be a political one not a technical one also remember that every dollar spend keep one spacecraft in safe mode probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation be a dollar not spend on mission analysi for a newer spacecraft in order to turn the spacecraft back on you either need to insure that the op guy will be available or you need to retrain a new team having say that there be some spacecraft that do what you have propose many of the operational satellite goddard fly like the tiro noaa series require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set extra which get replace on-orbit be power into a standby mode for use in an emergency in that case however the same op team be still require to fly the operational bird so the standby maintenance be relatively cheap finally pat explanation some spacecraft require continuou maintenance to stay under control be also right on the mark i suggest a spin stabilize control mode because it would require little power or maintenance but it still might require some momentum dump from time to time in the end it be a political decision since the difference be money but there be some technical rationale behind the decision david w gsfc
