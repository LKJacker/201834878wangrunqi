from dnadam dean adam subject ariane mission datum arianespace flight flight wa originally intend to carry the hughe series galaxy iv satellite but the payload wa withdraw just prior to flight the ariane launch be now schedule to place the astra and arsene satellite into an improve geostationary transfer orbit gto with inclination reduce to degree and apogee altitude increase by km thi will be the launch of an ariane and the first in the configuration with liquid strap-on booster pal it will be launch from the newly refurbish ariane launch complex ela in kourou french guiana the launch vehicle performance requirement for thi mission be kg of which kg represent the satellite ma the total vehicle ma at liftoff be kg required orbit characteristic perigee altitude km apogee altitude km at injection inclination degree the ariane lift-off for flight be schedule on thursday april a soon a possible within the follow launch window kourou time gmt washington dc launch vehicle ariane thi be a three-stage liquid fuel launcher with two liquid fuel strap-on booster the first stage be build by aerospatiale and be power by liquid fuel viking v engine the second stage be build by mbb erno and be power by a single viking iv engine both the viking iv and v engine be manufacture by sep the first and second stage use a biliquid fuel the third stage be build by aerospatiale and be power by a cryogenic fuel engine build by sep the two strap-on booster pal be each power by a viking vus engine also build by sep which use the same biliquid fuel a the first and second stage the fully assemble launch vehicle stand meter high on the pad it use the type ariane short payload fair flight profile liquid strap-on booster jettison first stage separation second stage ignition fairing jettison second stage separation third stage ignition third stage shutdown orbit injection astra separation cyclade adapter separation arsene separation end of ariane mission payload astra be the third spacecraft in the fleet of societe europeenne de satellite to broadcast direct tv to home all over europe built by hughe it will be the second launch by ariane total ma at lift-off kg mas at geo insertion kg dry ma kg on-board power w end of life nominal lifetime year span of solar panel m on-orbit position degree east over africa transmission capacity channel in ku-band vium transponder in-flight operation solar array deployment about day after lift-off first of apogee motor fire about hour after lift-off at apogee arsene be the first spacecraft build by the european space industry for the benefit of the world amateur radio community total ma at lift-off kg mas at geo insertion kg dry ma kg on-board power w end of life nominal lifetime year spacecraft dimension x orbital parameter km inclination period transmission capacity s-band transponder at ghz mhz launch coverage all ariane mission be broadcast live vium satellite from kourou coverage begin at minute before launch and continue until all payload have be deploy thi mission will likely be carry in the u on galaxy however it could be galaxy or another satellite what be the european satellite normally use for ariane coverage dean adam
