from baalke ron baalke subject mar observer update forwarded from the mar observer project mar observer statu report april am pdt flight sequence be active the spacecraft subsystem and instrument payload perform well in array normal spin and outer cruise configuration with uplink and downlink vium the high gain antenna uplink at bp downlink at the k engineering datum rate a a result of the spacecraft enter contingency mode on april all payload instrument be automatically power off by on-board fault protection software gamma ray spectrometer random acces memory wa successfully reload on monday april to prepare for magnetometer calibration which be reschedule for execution in flight sequence on tuesday and wednesday of next week a reload of payload datum system random acces memory will take place thi morning begin at am over thi weekend the flight team will send real-time command to perform differential one-way ranging to obtain additional datum for analysi by the navigation team radio science ultra stable oscillator test will take place on monday the flight sequence uplink will occur on sunday april with activation at midnight monday even april ha be modify to include magnetometer calibration which could not be perform in due to contingency mode entry on april these magnetometer instrument calibration will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and it effect on their instrument thi information be critical to martian magnetic field measurement which occur during approach and map phase mag cal will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of array normal spin state and perform slew and roll maneuver to provide the mag team datum point in vary spacecraft attitude and orientation today the spacecraft be km mi from mar travel at a velocity of mph with respect to mar one-way light time be approximately minute second ron baalke baalke jet propulsion lab telo the aweto from new zealand pasadena ca be part caterpillar and part vegetable
