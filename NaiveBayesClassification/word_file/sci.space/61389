from kwp kevin w plaxco subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article abdkw david ward write given that fact and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of approx arcmin we might be able to figure out how well batse can determine the location rotational of a gamma ray burster from knowledge of the all-sky map accuracy pr material for the other three instrument give accuracy on the order of fraction of a degree if that any help but i believe that there be a fundamental difference here the other x three instrument be focus instrument that more or le form an image so positional error be limit by craft attitude and the resolve power of the optic batse be an altogether different beast effectively just coincidence counter one on each corner of the craft positional information be triangulate from the differential signal arrival time at each of the detector positional error would be predominantly determine by time error and error in craft attitude since none of the baste detector have any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be use to determine parallax indeed parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error demonstrating that these puppy be beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcsecond since the oort cloud be postulate to extend to about parsec all together now parallax arc second a parsec be the distance of an object that demonstrate one arc second of parallax with a au base line if the degree accuracy report above be true we go to have to add a baste to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline the beauty of baste be that it both gife positional information and watch the entire sky simultaneously a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst be come from kevin
