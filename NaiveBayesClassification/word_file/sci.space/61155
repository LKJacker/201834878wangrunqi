from thomsonal subject what counntry do space surveillance ethnocentric usian that i be i assume that we and the xussr be the only country with significant capability to track non-cooperative object in low earth orbit grazing in a couple of databasis recently i find that japan ha some optical capability along thi line and also use a radar design for other purpose for orbital debris survey it be clear whether the radar can determine orbital element for the object it detect abstract of the article be append thi lead to the more general question do yet other person than the u russium and japan do space surveillance and if so how and why allen thomson saic mclean va usa abstract optical track of the experimental geodetic satellite eg takabe masao itabe toshikazu aruga tadashi radio research laboratory review issn vol march p in japanese with abstract in english thi paper report the optical track result of eg experimental geodetic satellite which wa launch on august by nasda the eg optical track experiment proces and an outline of the radio research laboratory rrl optical grind station be discuss a star track technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite track technique for orbit prediction improvement be also describe the accuracy of eg track datum obtain by rrl at the request of nasda be also discuss in addition it be briefly demonstrate that the position of the japanese amateur satellite which wa launch with the eg wa accurately determine by mean of a satellite track video it be clear from thi experiment that optical observation datum satellite direction datum be very useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch stage furthermore the result confirm the effectivene of these two satellite optical track technique mu radar

md apr p rpn aiaa paper distribution of orbital debris versu height and scatter cro section be determine from a series of observation make with a high power vhf doppler radar mu radar of japan an automate datum process algorithm ha be develop to discriminate echo of orbit object from those of undesired signal such a meteor trail echo or lightning atmospheric although the result be preliminary they show good agreement with those from norad track radar observation use a much higher frequency it be find that the collision frequency of a space station of km x km size at an altitude of km with orbit debris be expect to be a high a once per two year monitoring of the mu radar antenna pattern by satellite ohzora exos-c sato t inooka y fukao s kyoto univ japan kato s kyoto univ uji japan radio atmospheric science center in international council of scientific union middle atmosphere program handbook for map vol p publication date jun a the first attempt among mst mesosphere stratosphere troposphere type radar the mu middle and upper atmosphere radar feature an active phase array system unlike the conventional large vhf radar in which output power of a large vacuum tube be distribute to individual antenna element each of solid state power amplifier fee each antenna element thi system configuration enable very fast beam steer a well a variou flexible operation by divide the antenna into independent subarray because phase shift and signal be perform at a low signal level use electronic device under control of a computer network the antenna beam can be switch within microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of deg since a precise phase alignment of each element be crucial to realize the excellent performance of thi system careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element wa carry out among variou aircraft which may be use for thi purpose artificial satellite have an advantage of be able to make a long term monitor with the same system an antenna pattern monitor system for the mu radar wa develop use the scientific satellite ohzora exos-c a receiver name mum mu radar antenna monitor on board the satellite measure a cw signal of to watt transmit from the mu radar the principle of the measurement and result be discuss equatorial radar system fukao shoichiro tsuda toshitaka sato toru kato susumu kyoto university uji japan cospar iaga scostep et al plenary meeting workshop and symposium on the earth middle atmosphere espoo finland july advance in space research issn vol no p a large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observe the whole equatorial atmosphere up to km altitude be now be design in japan the radar will be build in pontianak west kalimantan indonesium deg n deg e the system be a monostatic doppler radar with an active phase array configuration similar to that of the mu radar in japan which ha be in successful operation since it will have a pa product of about x to the w sq m p average transmitter power a effective antenna aperture with a sensitivity of approximately time that of the mu radar thi system configuration enable pulse-to-pulse beam steer within deg from the zenith a be the case of the mu radar a variety of operation will be make feasible under the supervision of the radar controller a brief description of the system configuration be present
