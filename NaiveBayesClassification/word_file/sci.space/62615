from cshotton chuck shotton subject re interesting dc-x cost anecdote in article aw allen w sherzer write a staffer just tell me an interest story about dc-x an air force cost team just look at the dc-x now call the btw and give an estimate on how much it would cost the air force to build it it cost sdio to build and it would cost the usaf million or fmy and a half time a much i be will to bet that a majority of the cost difference could be account for by the af requirement for superfluou documentation or huge requirement and design review travel expense fly personnel around to meet and over specify the hardware i doubt that the actual fabrication cost in material and labor would be very different from sdio cost of course thi be my cynical opinion base on year of watch the government procurement proces try to cover up a lack of creativity and innovation with ream of documentation
