from szabo nick szabo subject ssf redesign constellation ssf be up for redesign again let do it right thi time let step back and consider the functionality we want proces research life science research adaptation to space spacecraft maintenence the old nasa approach explified by shuttle and ssf so far wa to centralize functionality these project fail to meet their target by a wide margin the military and commercial user take most of their payload off shuttle after waste much effort to tie their payload to it and ssf ha crumble into disorganization and miscommunication over billion ha be spend on these two project with no reduction in launch cost and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization meanwhile military and commercial user have come up with a superior strategy for space development the constellation firstly different function be break down into different constellation place in the optimal orbit for each function thu we have the constellation in orbit comsat in clarke and molniya orbit etc secondly the task be distribute amongst several spacecraft in a constellation provide for redundancy and full coverage where need ssf main function require quite different environment and be also prime candidate for constellization we have the make of a microgravity constellation now comet and mir for long-duration flight for short-duration flight the best strategy for thi area be inexpensive incremental improvement installation of facility on mir linkup and transition from to a much le expensive or we might also expand the research program to take advantage of interest space environment eg the high-radiation van allen belt or gradient in comet tail the comet system can be much more easily retrofit for these task where a station be too large to affordably launch beyond leo we need to study life science not just in microgravity but also in lunar and martian gravity and in the radiation environment of deep space instead of the protect shelter of leo thi be a very long-term low-priority project since astronaut will have little practical use in the space program until cost come down order of magnitude furthermore use astronaut severely restrict the scope of the investigation and the sample size so i propose labratsat a constellation tether-bolo satellite that test out variou level of gravity in super-van-allen-belt orbit that be representative of the radiation environment encounter on earth-moon earth-mar earth-asteroid etc trip the miniaturize life support machinery might be operate real-time from earth thru a vr interface after several orbital mission have be fly follow-on can act a ldef on the lunar and martian surface test out the actual environment at low cost before billion be spend on astronaut by far the largest market for spacecraft service be in clarke orbit i propose a fleet of small teleoperated robot and small test satellite on which grind engineer can practice their skill once in place robot can pry stick solar array and antenna attach solar battery power pack inject fuel etc once the fleet be work it can be spin off to commercial company s who can work with the comsat company to develop comsat replaceable module standard by apply the successful constellation strategy and get rid of the fail centralize strategy of st and old ssf we have radically improve the capability of the program while greatly cut it cost for a fraction of ssf pricetag we can fix satellite where the satellite be we can study life adaptation to a much large more representative variety of space environment and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and if need in special-purpose orbit we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration a well greatly cut it cost and increase it functionality mar network and artemi be two good example of thi more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plant on mar that can be use to fuel planet-wide hopper prospect and sample return the descendant of labratsat technology can be use a a mar surface ldef and to test out closed-ecology greenhouse on mar at low cost nick szabo szabo
