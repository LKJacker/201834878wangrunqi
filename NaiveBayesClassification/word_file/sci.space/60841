from eder dani eder subject re elevator to the top floor reading from a amoco performance product datum sheet their resin with carbon fiber reinforcement ha a compressive strength of psi it ha a density of in therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself be million inch or ft or statute mile now a real structure will have horizontal brace either a trus type or guy wire or both and will be use below the crush strength let u assume that we will operate at of the theoretical strength thi gife a work height of mile for a constant section column a constant section column be not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a taper of the cro section a you go up for example let u say you have a pound load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in calculation thi require square inch of column cro sectional area to support the weight the mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh lb so at mile below the payload the total load be now lb a increase the next mile of structure must be thicker in cro section to support the top mile of tower plu the payload each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom we can see from thi that there be no theoretical limit on area although there will be practical limit base on how much composite we can afford to by at and how much load you need to support on the grind for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support let u arbitrarily choose billion a the limit in costruction cost with thi we can afford perhap lb of composite assume my finish structure cost the figure be just for material cost then we have a ma ratio of at a ma ratio per mile the tower height become mile thi be clearly above the significant atmosphere a rocket launch from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and g-loss will be almost eliminate g-loss be the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity thu they represent waste thrust together with drag rocket start from the grind have a velocity penalty to contend with thi analysi be simplify in that it do not consider wind load these will require more structural support over the first mile of height above that the air pressure drop to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor dani eder dani investment company w h box athen al n w alt
