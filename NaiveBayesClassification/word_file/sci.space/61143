from baalke ron baalke subject jpl vlbi project meet with international space agency from the jpl universe april vlbi project meet with international space agency by ed mcnevin member of jpl space very long baseline interferometry vlbi project team recently conclude a week-long series of meet with official from russium and japan the meet be part of space vlbi week hold at jpl in early march and be intend to maintain cooperation between international space agency participate in the development of the space vlbi project a recently approve jpl flight project set for launch in space vlbi will utilize two earth-orbiting spacecraft the japanese vsop vlbi space observing program satellite with it radio telescope and a russian radioastron satellite both spacecraft will team up with ground-based radio telescope locate around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomer hope will expand radio telescope observe power by a factor of japan vsop satellite will use a limit six-hmy orbit to conduct image science while the russian radioastron spacecraft will exploit a larger earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy each satellite will point at a source target for roughly hour while approximately ground-based radio telescope will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on earth according to dr joel smith jpl project manager for the space vlbi meet like those hold at jpl will permit japan and russium who have little previou experience in radio interferometry to establish work relationship with the radio astronomy community that will be vital during the complex observation require by the space vlbi project one of my main activity be develop the methodology for international coordination because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the correspond track station while use the ground-based radio telescope to observe the same celestial object say smith three new track antenna be be build at dsn facility and other three other track facility locate in japan russium and green bank thi global network of ground-based radio telescope will use precision clock and high-speed recorder to collect observation datum and forward the information to a correlator locate at the national radio astronomy observatory in socorro the correlator will combine and proces datum then make it available to mission investigator in moscow tokyo and jpl vium electronic mail smith be optimistic that the massive radio telescope create by the space vlbi network will provide radio astronomer with better resolution than ha ever be achieve before by ground-based radio telescope allow astronomer to take a closer look at distant object in space there be a long history of radio astronomy use ground-based telescope say smith what we intend to do be to extend radio astronomy into earth orbit my goal be to look deeper into the core of galactic nucleus quasar and other active radio source to understand what drife those thing we have see so far with radio astronomy smith note that if one examine the active galactic nucleus you find jet appear to spew at speed greater than light and at energy level that be million of time greater than you would expect he say some astronomer believe that black hole may be locate in the core of these galaxy and that they may fuel the jet smith hope that by use space vlbi to look further into the core thi theory may be support or disprove russian space-flight hardware include transponder and transmitter be now be test in the united state and japanese hardware be schedule to arrive for test later thi year analysi of thi hardware will permit scientist and engineer to understand how to modify the high-speed vlba correlator operate at the nrao in order to accommodate the odd datum pattern that will originate from the more than ground-based radio telescope involve in space vlbi smith be particularly please that meet with the japanese and russian space agency official like those hold at jpl in march have proceed smoothly yet he know that the political uncertainty in russium could jeopardize that country participation in the project nothing be ever smooth he say but the russian have be incredibly open with u we alway anticipate some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factor beyond my control yet there tend to be a way of keep these thing go because scientist on both side be try hard and person recognize the value of cooperation at thi level smith point out that the japanese space agency ha more at stake than just fulfil an international commitment to a science mission the japanese have be extremely cooperative since international cooperation be essential to their science mission he say but smith also note that japanese space agency official look at the space vlbi mission a an opportunity to showcase the technology involve with vsop spacecraft and their highly regard mach v launch vehicle yet regardles of the risk involve in undertake such an ambitiou project jpl smith be satisfy that plan for the space vlbi project be beyond the significant financial and political hurdle that otherwise might threaten the project fortunately we have the virtue of have two partner and if either fall out we would still have something with the other by themself both spacecraft be independent
