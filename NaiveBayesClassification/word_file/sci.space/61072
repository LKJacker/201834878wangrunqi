from hancock thoma hancock subject re dennisn denni newkirk write the centaur be control technology state dept will not allow it to be use outside of u sorry in article jgreen jame thoma green write ha anyone look into the possiblity of a combo what would be the benefit and problem with such a combo other than the obviou instability in the xssr now i have see any speculation about it but the salyut kb design bureau wa plan a new second stage for the proton which would boost payload to leo from about to kg geostationary go from kg gal launcher version to kg thi scheme wa compete with the energia-m last year and i have hear which win except now i recently read that the central specialized kb wa work on the successor to the soyuz booster which must be the energia-m so the early result be energia-m win but thi be a gues nothing be very clear in russium i sure if salyut kb get fund from someone they will continue their development the centaur for the alta be about meter dium and the proton be so that a good fit for their exist upper stage the block-d which set inside a shround just under meter dium i do know about launch load etc but since the centaur survife titan launch which be probably worse than the proton those titan srb probably shake thing up pretty good it seem feasible except the centaur be a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which be not available now proton be assemble and transport horizontially do anyone know how much stres in the way of a payload a centaur could support while bolt to a proton horizontally and then take down the rail road track and erect on the pad they would also need lox and lh facility add to the proton pad unles the new proton second stage be actually build and of course any centaur support system and facility no doubt import from the u at great cost these system may viloate u law so there be political problem to solve in addition to the instability in the ci you mention denni newkirk dennisn motorola land mobile product sector schaumburg il
