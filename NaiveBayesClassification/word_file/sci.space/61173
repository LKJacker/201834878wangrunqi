from josh hopkin subject rimsat joint venture i be to three talk in the last month which might be of interest i transcribe some of my note below since my note take ability be by no mean infallible please assume that all factual error be mine permission be grant to copy thi without restriction michael sternberg cheif of operation of rimsat wa invite to speak at an informal lunch hold by acdi here on the campu of the university of illinoi acdi be an organization on campu that deal with arm control disarmament and international security rimsat wa consider an appropriate topic because the company be use russian launcher and satellite i think it also help that hi daughter be a grad student in the international relation program the concept behind rimsat apparently begin when matt neilson go to tonga to visit a friend while he wa there he somehow end up visit the king who happen to be a big tv fan matt buy the king a satellite dish which the king think wa really nifty since tonga ha a gnp of about million hi majesty ask if there wa any way to make money off thi matt think there probably wa so at hi suggestion tonga apply for geosynchronou satellite slot while thi be entirely off the wall it wa very unusual see a tonga wa a tiny kingdom with no space program and be a lot of slot the whole thing wa debate in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who be apparently a respect space lawyer write several opinion support tonga case eventually tonga end up with slot range from e to e slot be designate by the longitude over which they reside according to sternberg fmy of these from e to e be the best in the world because they be excellently place for communication between hawaius and the pacific rim rimsat wa form to use these slot it wa officially form in nevi a a tax haven they try for a few year to raise fund in the west however to fill slot with western satellite launch on western launcher would have cost approximately billion it not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of use russian hardware they begin negotiate with glavkosmo for hardware mr sternberg describe operate in moscow in such harsh term that i do think i visit there for a long time beside a significant lack of creature comfort he wa not happy with the way that person operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper document and license that indicate they be the only one who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arrange a deal with glavkosmo for satellite at a cost of million however glavkosmo lose favor after the coup sternberg say that thi be because they be basically a bunch of kgb operative who go to trade show and pick up lot of brochure since glavkosmo wa out of power he have to renegotiate the deal with the new authority he again describe life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable term eventually he work out a deal and on dec he meet with koptev who head the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insist on a few concession before sign and accord to sternberg he arrange these new rule to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing a rimsat the next step wa to meet with the builder of the hardware npo applied mechanic npo pm to use their acronym thi organization be locate in siberium ca figure out how to spell the town i need an atla and ha build about vehicle since the dawn of the space age sternberg comment that siberian be very different from musovite they be hard worker honest person who team up to get thing do very much like midwesterner at thi point there be some comment from the audience that agree with hi opinion on both siberian and midwesterner sternberg have lot of good thing to say about npo pm hi company be apparently lookng for million to invest in the firm to become apparently cost the russian about million to build a satellite that would sell for million in the west if you want to give them specification they build you a satellite for the particular satellite that rimsat will be use cost run about per transponder year thi compare to in the they can sell their time for about million compare to million in the rimsat will launch their satellite on proton to get the best price they buy in bulk they have the right to twelve launch so if any of you need a lift i can give you their addres the first launch be schedule for october and they be get one use satellite from the russian which be be move into place now tidbit sternberg say thi kind of thing ha to be do by entrepreneur not big busines because big busines be just like what they have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier russian launch be self insure the promise to replace a fail launch within month major investor in rimsat include russell which be a huge retirement fund organization cellsat which be a big telecom busines in southeast asium and a fund operate by some of the big name in aerospace which he say be sort of an insurance policy for them if thi really take off he downplay the instabilite in the ex-ussr say that we be worry partly because we be use to see russium a anything but an unvarying monolith italy get a new government every two week but we do worry because we use to it he predict that once we get use to see what really go on in russium we wo worry about their stability a much part of the problem with cooperative venture be the problem of transfer money the central bank ha a policy of take hard currency payment put in their coffer and replace the rest with the equivalent value in ruble to get around thi rimsat pay their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pay their contractor with foreign currency so that the only the contractor get swindle by the government one of the big problem rimsat ha have be stonewall by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently buy three of the same type of satellite which wa rather reassure the biggest worry most person have about russian satellite be the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont horizon satellite have a lifetime of about year while the more modern expres satellite compare well with western technology and last about year while thi be much shorter than year for western satellite sternberg downplay the difference at these price they can afford to launch new one in addition shorter lifetime mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware josh hopkin find a way or make one attribute to hannibal
