from palmer david m palmer subject re gamma ray burster where be they prb pat write we know it not real close like slightly extra solar because we have no parallax measurement on the burst we can only say that they be beyond about au due to the low accuracy of position determination by single detector what i be wonder be thi in person opinion a new physic problem einstein get well know for solvingthe photoelectric effect copernicu start look at irregularity in planetary motion is thi a big enough problem to create a new area of physic just a little speculative think folk it may be a new physic problem a problem involve new physic however the datum be not good enough to rule out the model which use old physic new physic be a big step and be only tolerate when there be no alternative for example the dark matter problem there more to the universe than meet the eye be a question of comparable mystery to grb but we have much better datum regard it theoretician postulate new particle all the time to explain it but no one will actually believe that these particle be real until an experimentalist or several detect them in the lab david m palmer palmer palmer
