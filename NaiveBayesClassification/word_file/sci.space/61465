from sdd steve derry subject re hst servicing mission scheduled for day pat prb write the limit on space-walking be a function of suit supply mas and orbiter duration in order to perform the re-boost of the hst the om engine will be fire for a long period now the shuttle be a heavy thing the hst be light either the amount of om fuel need to fly both up be substantial a small booster carry up and use to boost hst on it own will weigh significantly le then the om fuel require to boost both hst and shuttle for a give orbital change from what i understand the ma margin on the hst mission be tight enough they ca even carry extra suit or mmu pat i have see any specific on the hst repair mission but i ca see why the ma margin be tight what be they carry up replacement component wfpc ius costar gyro solar panel and probably a few other all sort of tool eva equipment and a much om fuel and consumable a they can thi should be lighter than the original hst deployment mission which achieve the highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date and hst be now in a lower orbit seem like the limit factor would be crew fatigue and mission complexity steve derry
