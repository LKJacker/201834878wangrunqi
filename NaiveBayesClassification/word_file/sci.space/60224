from prb pat subject re the area rule i be sure mary or henry can describe thi more aptly then me but here be how i understand it at speed near supersonic the wind behave like a fluid pipe it become incompressible so wind ha to bend away from the wing edge a the wing thicken the more the pipe bend if they have no place to go they begin to stall and force compression steal power from the vehicle high drag if you squeeze the fuselage so that these pipe have aplace to bend into then drag be reduce essentially teh cro sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all area of the fuselage that be where the wing be subtract teh cro sectional area of the wing from the fuselage pat
