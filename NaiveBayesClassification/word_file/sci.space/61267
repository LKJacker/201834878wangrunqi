subject re gamma ray burster how energetic could they be from belgarath in article jfc john f carr write if gamma ray burster be extragalactic would absorption from the galaxy be expect how transparent be the galactic core to gamma ray how much energy do a burster put out i know energy depend on distance which be unknown an answer of the form x erg per be ok john carr jfc i have to turn to one of my problem set that i do in clas for thi little problem i do have a calculator but i do have the problem set that we do not too long ago so i use that and hope it what you want thi be a highly simplify problem with a very simple burst burst be usually more complex than thi example i will use here my burst ha a peak flux of erg and a duration of second during the frst second of the burst and the last second it flux be half of the peak flux it flux be the peak flux the rest of the time assume that the background flux be erg then we have to find the integrate luminosity of the burst for several different sphere oort cloud radiu at the edge of the galaxy or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a we integrate the flux over all time to find the fluence then use the old standby formula pu fpeak for a radiu of pc we find an l around pretty energetic for close by for the coronal model we find around and lastly for the cosmological model an that what you call moderately energetic i say any suggestion about what could put out that much energy in one second jeremy
