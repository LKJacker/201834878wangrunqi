from it enrico palazzo subject re gamma ray burster where be they from graydon saundrsg if all of these thing have be detect in space ha anyone look into possible problem with the detector that be be there some mechanism cosmic ray whatever that could cause the dector to think it wa see one of these thing graydon that would not explain why widely separate detector such a on ulyss and pvo and ginga et al would see a burst at the same time in fact be fore batse have thi widely separate interplanetary network wa the only sure way to locate a random burst with only one detector one can not locate a burst except to say it somewhere in the field of view with two detector one can use the time that the burst be see in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulu on the sky with three detector one get intersect annulus give two possible location if one of these location be impossible because say the earth block that part of the sky voila you have an error box batse by have detector of it own can do it own location determination but only to within about degree would someone at gsfc like david like to comment on the current state of location determination having inde pendent sight by other detector help drive down the uncertainty you do touch on something that you do mean to though some believe in a reference that i have somewhere that absorption-like feature see in a fraction of grb can actually be cause by the detector it would be a mean nasty god though that would have a nai crystal act like a gaus neutron star but thi be get too far afield peter peterf
