from david b mckissock subject re space station redesign jsc alternative in article kjenk write description of external tank option for ssf redesign delete mark propose thi design at joe shea committee in crystal city and he report that he wa warmly receive however the rumor i hear say that a design base on a wingles space shuttle orbiter seem more likely yo ken let keep on-top of thing both the external tank and wingles orbiter option have be delete from the ssf redesign option list today edition of the new york time report that tell the panel that some redesign proposal have be drop such a use the giant external fuel tank use in launch space shuttle and build a station around an exist space shuttle with it wing and tail remove currently there be three option be consider a present to the advisory panel meet yesterday and a report in today time option a low cost modular approach thi option be be study by a team from msfc a an aside there be ssf redesign team at msfc jsc and larc support the srt station redesign team in crystal city both lerc and reston folk be also on-site at these location help the respective team with their redesign activity key feature of thi option be use a modular bu develop by lockheed that qualify for st and elv the bu provide propulsion gn c communication datum management lockheed develop thi for the air force a power station capability be obtain in shuttle flight ssf solar array be use to provide kw of power the vehicle fly in an arrow mode to optimize the microgravity environment mission would utilize the vehilce a a power source for day mission human tend capability a oppose to the old ssf sexist term of man-tended capability be achieve by the addition of the u common module thi be a modify version of the exist ssf lab module dock port be add for the international partner lab take the place of the node on ssf the shuttle can be dock to the station for day mission the orbiter would provide crew habitability eva capability international human tended add the nasda esa module and add another kw of power permanent human presence capability add a power module the habitation module and an acrv assured crew return vehicle option b space station freedom derived the option b team be base at larc and be lead by mike griffin thi option look alot like the exist ssf design which we have all come to know and love thi option assume a lightweight external tank be available for use on all ssf assembly flight so do option a also the number of flight be compute for a inclination orbit for both option a and b the build-up occur in six phase initial research capability reach after flight power be transfer from the vehicle to the when it visit man-tended capability griffin ha not yet adopt non-sexist language be achieve after flight the lab be deploy and solar power module provide kw of power permanent human presence capability occur after flight by keep one orbiter on-orbit to use a an acrv so sometime there would be two orbiter on-orbit the acrv and the second one that come up for logistic re-supply a two fault tolerance capability be achieve after flight with the addition of a power module another thermal control system radiator and more propulsion module after flight the international be on-board more power the habitation module and an acrv be add to finish the assembly in flight most of the system currently on ssf be use as-i in thi option with the exception of the datum management system which ha major change option c single core launch station thi be the jsc lead option basically you take a ft diameter cylinder that ft long slap space shuttle main engine on the backside put a nose cone on the top attach it to a regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket motor and launch the can some key feature be complete end-to-end grind integration and checkout tangentially mount fix solar panel body mount radiator which add protection against micrometeroid orbital debris centerline dock port one on each end berth port a single pressurize volume approximately cubic foot twice the volume of skylab floor center passageway between floor kw of housekeep power graceful degradation with failure power channel thermal loop dual environmental control life support system increase crew time for utilization micro-g thru out the core module
