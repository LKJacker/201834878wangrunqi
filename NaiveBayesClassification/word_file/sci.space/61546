from mlindroo marcu lindroo inf subject re mothership for flyby and cut cost in nsmca write getting wierd again okay what about launch one probe with multiple part kind of liek the old mirv principle of old cold war day basically what i mean be design a mother ship that ha piggy back probe for different mission namely different planet each probe would be tie in with the mother ship or earth a the case may be thi be good when and if we go for mar the mar mission can act a either mother ship or relay point for the probe i ca see the need for a single big expensive heavy mothership except for voyager style flyby mission a few year ago i do some calculation on a grand tmy space probe launch by a saturn v in at the time i felt that the idea of a big mother ship have some merit the voyager have to be rather small lightweight craft due to the limitation impose by use weak titan launcher the concept i examine and michael have a lot in common with the british interplanetary society daedalu project for send a probe to barnard star a large bu spacecraft carry several smaller probe to be dispatch when the ship arrife at it destination the saturn v supposedly would have be able to launch a payload toward jupiter and beyond the bu could have include far more powerful equipment and a powerful power source than the voyager a there would be no limitation on weight anymore extremely important a the voyager have to perform most of their measurement within a couple of week before and after planetary encounter and usually at a relatively great distance the smaller probe carry aboard might have be base on the real voyager and an even smaller version like the one schedule for launch toward pluto in the early century and would have be release at variou point during the mission the advantage be obviou the bu would have carry out the same basic jupiter-saturn-uranus-neptune mission than voyager do but in addition two sub-probe could have be relased at saturn examine that planet south polar region before move on to pluto thi would have enable nasa to map both hemisphere of by and several other probe could have examine part of the system that be examine in great detail by the voyager due to trajectory-related factor a small swarm of camera-equipped miniature space probe release a month before encounter would have be too costly for a small voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launch from a heavy well-equipped spacecraft and would we have learn a lot more about the outer planet the reason why the grand tmy wa cancel wa lack of money of course marcu michael adam nsmca i not high just jack
