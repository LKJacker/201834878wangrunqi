region introduction from my small world we have gaze upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousand of year ancient astronomer observe point of light that appear to move among the star they call these object planet mean wanderer and name them after roman deity jupiter king of the god mar the god of war mercury messenger of the god venu the god of love and beauty and saturn father of jupiter and god of agriculture the stargazer also observe comet with sparkle tail and meteor or shoot star apparently fall from the sky science flourish during the european renaissance fundamental physical law govern planetary motion be discover and the orbit of the planet around the sun be calculate in the century astronomer point a new device call the telescope at the heaven and make startle discovery but the year since have amount to a golden age of solar system exploration advancement in rocketry after world war ius enable my machine to break the grip of earth gravity and travel to the moon and to other planet the united state ha send automate spacecraft then human-crewed expedition to explore the moon my automate machine have orbit and land on venu and mar explore the sun environment observe comet and make close-range survey while fly past mercury jupiter saturn uranu and neptune these traveler bring a quantum leap in my knowledge and understand of the solar system through the electronic sight and other sense of my automate spacecraft color and complexion have be give to world that for century appear to earth-bound eye a fuzzy disk or indistinct point of light and dozen of previously unknown object have be discover future historian will likely view these pioneer flight through the solar system a some of the most remarkable achievement of the century automated spacecraft the national aeronautic and space administration nasa automate spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shape and size while they be design to fulfill separate and specific mission objective the craft share much in common each spacecraft consist of variou scientific instrument select for a particular mission support by basic subsystem for electrical power trajectory and orientation control a well a for process datum and communicate with earth electrical power be require to operate the spacecraft instrument and system nasa use both solar energy from array of photovoltaic cell and small nuclear generator to power it solar system mission rechargeable battery be employ for backup and supplemental power imagine that a spacecraft ha successfully journey million of mile through space to fly but one time near a planet only to have it camera and other sense instrument point the wrong way a it speed past the target to help prevent such a mishap a subsystem of small thruster be use to control spacecraft the thruster be link with device that maintain a constant gaze at select star just a earth early seafarer use the star to navigate the ocean spacecraft use star to maintain their bear in space with the subsystem lock onto fix point of reference flight controller can keep a spacecraft scientific instrument point at the target body and the craft communication antenna point toward earth the thruster can also be use to fine-tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body be encounter at the plan distance and on the proper trajectory between and nasa spacecraft be dispatch to study the moon and the solar environment they also scan the inner planet other than earth mercury venu and mar these three world and my own be know a the terrestrial planet because they share a solid-rock composition for the early planetary reconnaissance mission nasa employ a highly successful series of spacecraft call the mariner their flight help shape the plan of later mission between and seven mariner mission conduct the first survey of my planetary neighbor in space all of the mariner use solar panel a their primary power source the first and the final version of the spacecraft have two wing cover with photovoltaic cell other mariner be equip with fmy solar panel extend from their octagonal body although the mariner range from the mariner venu spacecraft weigh in at kilogram pound to the mariner mar orbiter weigh in at kilogram pound their basic design remain quite similar throughout the program the mariner venu spacecraft for example have originally be a backup for the mariner mar flyby the mariner spacecraft send to venu and mercury use component leave over from the mariner mar orbiter program in nasa launch pioneer a jupiter spacecraft interest wa shift to fmy of the outer planet jupiter saturn uranu and neptune giant ball of dense ga quite different from the terrestrial world we have already survey fmy nasa spacecraft in all two pioneer and two voyager be send in the to tmy the outer region of my solar system because of the distance involve these traveler take anywhere from month to year to reach their destination barring faster spacecraft they will eventually become the first human artifact to journey to distant star because the sun light become so faint in the outer solar system these traveler do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generate by heat from the decay of radioisotope nasa also develop highly specialize spacecraft to revisit my neighbor mar and venu in the middle and late twin viking lander be equip to serve a seismic and weather station and a biology laboratory two advance orbiter descendant of the mariner craft carry the viking lander from earth and then study martian feature from above two drum-shaped pioneer spacecraft visit venu in the pioneer venu orbiter wa equip with a radar instrument that allow it to see through the planet dense cloud cover to study surface feature the pioneer venu multiprobe carry fmy probe that be drop through the cloud the probe and the main body all of which contain scientific instrument radio information about the planet atmosphere during their descent toward the surface a new generation of automate spacecraft include magellan galileo ulyss mar observer the comet flyby craf and cassini be be develop and send out into the solar system to make detail examination that will increase my understand of my neighborhood and my own planet the sun a discussion of the object in the solar system must start with the sun the sun dwarf the other body represent approximately percent of all the ma in the solar system all of the planet moon asteroid comet dust and ga add up to only about percent thi percent represent the material leave over from the sun formation one hundred and nine earth would be require to fit acros the sun disk and it interior could hold over million earth a a star the sun generate energy through the proces of fusion the temperature at the sun core be million degree celsiu million degree fahrenheit and the pressure there be billion time earth air pressure at sea level the sun surface temperature of degree celsiu degree fahrenheit seem almost chilly compare to it core-temperature at the solar core hydrogen can fuse into helium produce energy the sun also produce a strong magnetic field and stream of charge particle both extend far beyond the planet the sun appear to have be active for billion year and ha enough fuel to go on for another five billion year or so at the end of it life the sun will start to fuse helium into heavier element and begin to swell up ultimately grow so large that it will swallow earth after a billion year a a red giant it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf the final end product of a star like our it may take a trillion year to cool off completely many spacecraft have explore the sun environment but none have get any closer to it surface than approximately two-third of the distance from earth to the sun pioneer the pioneer venu orbiter voyager and and other spacecraft have all sample the solar environment the ulyss spacecraft launch on october be a joint solar mission of nasa and the european space agency after use jupiter gravity to change it trajectory ulyss will fly over the sun polar region during and and will perform a wide range of study use nine onboard scientific instrument we be fortunate that the sun be exactly the way it be if it be different in almost any way life would almost certainly never have develop on earth mercury obtaining the first close-up view of mercury wa the primary objective of the mariner spacecraft launch on november from kennedy space center in florida after a journey of nearly five month which include a flyby of venu the spacecraft pass within kilometer mile of the solar system innermost planet on march until mariner little wa know about mercury even the best telescopic view from earth show mercury a an indistinct object lack any surface detail the planet be so close to the sun that it be usually lose in solar glare when the planet be visible on earth horizon just after sunset or before dawn it be obscure by the haze and dust in my atmosphere only radar telescope give any hint of mercury surface condition prior to the voyage of mariner the photograph mariner radio back to earth reveal an ancient heavily cratered surface closely resemble my own moon the picture also show huge cliff crisscross the planet these apparently be create when mercury interior cool and shrink buckle the planet crust the cliff be a high a kilometer mile and a long a kilometer mile instrument on mariner discover that mercury ha a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere a trillionth the density of earth atmosphere and compose chiefly of argon neon and helium when the planet orbit take it closest to the sun surface temperature range from degree celsiu degree fahrenheit on mercury sunlit side to degree celsiu degree fahrenheit on the dark side thi range in surface temperature degree celsiu degree fahrenheit be the largest for a single body in the solar system mercury literally bake and freeze at the same time day and night be long on mercury the combination of a slow rotation relative to the star earth day and a rapid revolution around the sun earth day mean that one mercury solar day take earth day or two mercury year the time it take the innermost planet to complete two orbit around the sun mercury appear to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of earth scientist believe mercury ha a heavy iron-rich core make up slightly le than half of it volume that would make mercury core larger proportionally than the moon core or those of any of the planet after the initial mercury encounter mariner make two additional flyby on september and march before control ga use to orient the spacecraft wa exhaust and the mission wa conclude each flyby take place at the same local mercury time when the identical half of the planet wa illuminate a a result we still have not see one-half of the planet surface venu veiled by dense cloud cover venu my nearest planetary neighbor wa the first planet to be explore the mariner spacecraft launch on august wa the first of more than a dozen successful american and soviet mission to study the mysteriou planet a spacecraft fly by or orbit venu plunge into the atmosphere or gently land on venu surface romantic myth and speculation about my neighbor be lay to rest on december mariner pass within kilometer mile of venu and become the first spacecraft to scan another planet onboard instrument measure venu for minute mariner launch in june fly much closer to the planet passing within kilometer mile of venu on the second american flyby mariner instrument measure the planet magnetic field ionosphere radiation belt and temperature on it way to mercury mariner fly by venu and transmit ultraviolet picture to earth show cloud circulation pattern in the venusian atmosphere in the spring and summer of two spacecraft be launch to further unravel the mystery of venu on december of the same year the pioneer venu orbiter become the first spacecraft place in orbit around the planet five day later the five separate component make up the second spacecraft the pioneer venu multiprobe enter the venusian atmosphere at different location above the planet the fmy small independent probe and the main body radio atmospheric datum back to earth during their descent toward the surface although design to examine the atmosphere one of the probe survive it impact with the surface and continue to transmit datum for another hmy venu resemble earth in size physical composition and density more closely than any other know planet however spacecraft have discover significant difference a well for example venu rotation west to east be retrograde backward compare to the east-to-west spin of earth and most of the other planet approximately percent of venu atmosphere time a dense a earth be carbon dioxide the principal constituent of earth atmosphere be nitrogen venu atmosphere act like a greenhouse permit solar radiation to reach the surface but trap the heat that would ordinarily be radiate back into space a a result the planet average surface temperature be degree celsiu degree fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead a radio altimeter on the pioneer venu orbiter provide the first mean of see through the planet dense cloud cover and determine surface feature over almost the entire planet nasa magellan spacecraft launch on may ha be in orbit around venu since august the spacecraft use radar-mapping technique to provide ultrahigh-resolution image of the surface magellan ha reveal a landscape dominate by volcanic feature fault and impact crater huge area of the surface show evidence of multiple period of lava flood with flow lie on top of previou one an elevate region name ishtar terra be a lava-filled basin a large a the united state at one end of thi plateau sit maxwell monte a mountain the size of mount everest scarring the mountain flank be a wide deep impact crater name cleopatra almost all feature on venu be name for woman maxwell monte alpha regio and betum regio be the exception crater survive on venu for perhap million year because there be no water and very little wind erosion extensive fault-line network cover the planet probably the result of the same crustal flex that produce plate tectonic on earth but on venu the surface temperature be sufficient to weaken the rock which crack just about everywhere prevent the formation of major plate and large earthquake fault like the san andrea fault in californium venu predominant weather pattern be a high-altitude high-speed circulation of cloud that contain sulfuric acid at speed reach a high a kilometer mile per hmy the cloud circle the planet in only fmy earth day the circulation be in the same direction west to east a venu slow rotation of earth day wherea earth wind blow in both direction west to east and east to west in six alternate band venu atmosphere serve a a simplify laboratory for the study of my weather earth a view from space my world distinguish characteristic be it blue water brown and green land mass and white cloud we be envelop by an ocean of air consist of percent nitrogen percent oxygen and percent other constituent the only planet in the solar system know to harbor life earth orbit the sun at an average distance of million kilometer million mile earth be the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system with a diameter just a few hundred kilometer larger than that of venu my planet rapid spin and melt nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field which along with the atmosphere shield u from nearly all of the harmful radiation come from the sun and other star earth atmosphere protect u from meteor a well most of which burn up before they can strike the surface active geological process have leave no evidence of the pelt earth almost certainly receive soon after it form about billion year ago along with the other newly form planet it wa shower by space debris in the early day of the solar system from my journey into space we have learn much about my home planet the first american satellite explorer wa launch from cape canaveral in florida on january and discover an intense radiation zone now call the van allen radiation belt surround earth since then other research satellite have reveal that my planet magnetic field be distort into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind the stream of charge particle continuously eject from the sun we learn that the magnetic field do not fade off into space but ha definite boundary and we now know that my wispy upper atmosphere once believe calm and uneventful seethe with activity swell by day and contract by night affected by change in solar activity the upper atmosphere contribute to weather and climate on earth beside affect earth weather solar activity gife rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in my atmosphere when charge particle from the solar wind become trap in earth magnetic field they collide with air molecule above my planet magnetic pole these air molecule then begin to glow and be know a the aurora or the northern and southern light satellite about kilometer mile out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecast these watchful electronic eye warn u of dangerou storm continuou global monitor provide a vast amount of useful datum and contribute to a better understand of earth complex weather system from their unique vantage point satellite can survey earth ocean land use and resource and monitor the planet health these eye in space have save countles life provide tremendou convenience and show u that we may be alter my planet in dangerou way the moon the moon be earth single natural satellite the first human footstep on an alien world be make by american astronaut on the dusty surface of my airles lifeles companion in preparation for the human-crewed apollo expedition nasa dispatch the automate ranger surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between and nasa apollo program leave a large legacy of lunar material and datum six two-astronaut crew land on and explore the lunar surface between and carry back a collection of rock and soil weigh a total of kilogram pound and consist of more than separate sample from thi material and other study scientist have construct a history of the moon that include it infancy rock collect from the lunar highland date to about billion year old the first few million year of the moon existence be so violent that few trace of thi period remain a a melt outer layer gradually cool and solidify into different kind of rock the moon wa bombard by huge asteroid and smaller object some of the asteroid be a large a rhode island or delaware and their collision with the moon create basin hundred of kilometer acros thi catastrophic bombardment taper off approximately fmy billion year ago leave the lunar highland cover with huge overlap crater and a deep layer of shatter and break rock heat produce by the decay of radioactive element begin to melt the interior of the moon at depth of about kilometer mile below the surface then for the next million year from about to billion year ago lava rise from inside the moon the lava gradually spread out over the surface flood the large impact basin to form the dark area that galileo galilei an astronomer of the italian renaissance call marium mean sea a far a we can tell there ha be no significant volcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion year since then the lunar surface ha be alter only by micrometeorite by the atomic particle from the sun and star by the rare impact of large meteorite and by spacecraft and astronaut if my astronaut have land on the moon a billion year ago they would have see a landscape very similar to the one today thousand of year from now the footstep leave by the apollo crew will remain sharp and clear the origin of the moon be still a mystery fmy theory attempt an explanation the moon form near earth a a separate body it wa tear from earth it form somewhere else and wa capture by my planet gravity or it wa the result of a collision between earth and an asteroid about the size of mar the last theory ha some good support but be far from certain mar of all the planet mar ha long be consider the solar system prime candidate for harbor extraterrestrial life astronomer study the red planet through telescope saw what appear to be straight line crisscross it surface these observation later determine to be optical illusion lead to the popular notion that intelligent be have construct a system of irrigation canal on the planet in when orson welle broadcast a radio drama base on the science fiction classic war of the world by well enough person believe in the tale of invade martian to cause a near panic another reason for scientist to expect life on mar have to do with the apparent seasonal color change on the planet surface thi phenomenon lead to speculation that condition might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer month and cause plant life to become dormant during colder period so far six american mission to mar have be carry out fmy mariner spacecraft three fly by the planet and one place into martian orbit survey the planet extensively before the viking orbiter and lander arrive mariner launch in late fly past mar on july come within kilometer mile of the surface transmitting to earth close-up picture of the planet the spacecraft find many crater and naturally occur channel but no evidence of artificial canal or flow water mariner and follow with their flyby during the summer of and return picture mariner and show a diversity of surface condition a well a a thin cold dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide on may the mariner orbiter wa launch on a mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface the spacecraft arrive five and a half month after lift-off only to find mar in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that make surface photography impossible for several week but after the storm clear mariner begin return the first of picture these reveal previously unknown martian feature include evidence that large amount of water once flow acros the surface etch river valley and flood plain in august and september the viking and spacecraft each consist of an orbiter and a lander lift off from kennedy space center the mission wa design to answer several question about the red planet include is there life there nobody expect the spacecraft to spot martian city but it wa hop that the biology experiment on the viking lander would at least find evidence of primitive life past or present viking lander become the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it land on july while the united state wa celebrate it bicentennial photo send back from the chryse planitium plain of gold show a bleak rusty-red landscape panoramic image return by the lander reveal a roll plain litter with rock and mark by ripple sand dune fine red dust from the martian soil gife the sky a salmon hue when viking lander touch down on utopium planitium on september it view a more roll landscape than the one see by it predecessor one without visible dune the result send back by the laboratory on each viking lander be inconclusive small sample of the red martian soil be test in three different experiment design to detect biological process while some of the test result seem to indicate biological activity later analysi confirm that thi activity wa inorganic in nature and relate to the planet soil chemistry is there life on mar no one know for sure but the viking mission find no evidence that organic molecule exist there the viking lander become weather station record wind velocity and direction a well a atmospheric temperature and pressure few weather change be observe the highest temperature record by either craft wa degree celsiu degree fahrenheit at the viking lander site in midsummer the lowest temperature degree celsiu degree fahrenheit wa record at the more northerly viking lander site during winter near-hurricane wind speed be measure at the two martian weather station during global dust storm but because the atmosphere be so thin wind force be minimal viking lander photograph light patch of frost probably water-ice during it second winter on the planet the martian atmosphere like that of venu be primarily carbon dioxide nitrogen and oxygen be present only in small percentage martian air contain only about a much water a my air but even thi small amount can condense out form cloud that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slope of tower volcano local patch of early morning fog can form in valley there be evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allow water to flow on the planet physical feature closely resemble shoreline gorge riverbed and island suggest that great river once mark the planet mar ha two moon phobo and deimo they be small and irregularly shape and posse ancient cratered surface it be possible the moon be originally asteroid that venture too close to mar and be capture by it gravity the viking orbiter and lander exceed by large margin their design lifetime of and day respectively the first to fail wa viking orbiter which stop operate on july when a leak deplete it attitude-control ga viking lander operate until april when it wa shut down because of battery degeneration viking orbiter quit on august when the last of it attitude-control ga wa use up viking lander cease function on november despite the inconclusive result of the viking biology experiment we know more about mar than any other planet except earth nasa mar observer spacecraft to be launch in september will expand my knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet asteroid the solar system ha a large number of rocky and metallic object that be in orbit around the sun but be too small to be consider full-fledged planet these object be know a asteroid or minor planet most but not all be find in a band or belt between the orbit of mar and jupiter some have orbit that cro earth path and there be evidence that earth ha be hit by asteroid in the past one of the least erode best preserve example be the barringer meteor crater near winslow arizona asteroid be material leave over from the formation of the solar system one theory suggest that they be the remain of a planet that wa destroy in a massive collision long ago more likely asteroid be material that never coalesce into a planet in fact if the estimate total ma of all asteroid wa gather into a single object the object would be only about kilometer mile acros le than half the diameter of my moon thousand of asteroid have be identify from earth it be estimate that be bright enough to eventually be photograph through earth-based telescope much of my understand about asteroid come from examine piece of space debris that fall to the surface of earth asteroid that be on a collision course with earth be call meteoroid when a meteoroid strike my atmosphere at high velocity friction cause thi chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light know a a meteor if the meteoroid do not burn up completely what leave strike earth surface and be call a meteorite one of the best place to look for meteorite be the ice cap of antarctica of all the meteorite examine percent be compose of silicate stone and percent be compose of iron and nickel the rest be a mixture of the three material stony meteorite be the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rock since asteroid be material from the very early solar system scientist be interest in their composition spacecraft that have fly through the asteroid belt have find that the belt be really quite empty and that asteroid be separate by very large distance current and future mission will fly by select asteroid for closer examination the galileo orbiter launch by nasa in october will investigate main-belt asteroid on it way to jupiter the comet flyby craf and cassini mission will also study these far-flung object scheduled for launch in the latter part of the the craf and cassini mission be a collaborative project of nasa the european space agency and the federal space agency of germany and italy a well a the united state air force and the department of energy one day space factory will mine the asteroid for raw material jupiter beyond mar and the asteroid belt in the outer region of my solar system lie the giant planet of jupiter saturn uranu and neptune in nasa dispatch the first of fmy spacecraft slat to conduct the initial survey of these colossal world of ga and their moon of ice and rock jupiter wa the first port of call pioneer which lift off from kennedy space center in march wa the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer region of the solar system in december it return the first close-up image of jupiter fly within kilometer mile of the planet band cloud top pioneer follow a year later voyager and be launch in the summer of and return spectacular photograph of jupiter and it family of satellite during flyby in these traveler find jupiter to be a whirl ball of liquid hydrogen and helium top with a colorful atmosphere compose mostly of gaseou hydrogen and helium ammonium ice crystal form white jovian cloud sulfur compound and perhap phosphoru may produce the brown and orange hue that characterize jupiter atmosphere it be likely that methane ammonium water and other gas react to form organic molecule in the region between the planet frigid cloud top and the warmer hydrogen ocean lie below because of jupiter atmospheric dynamic however these organic compound if they exist be probably short-lived the great red spot ha be observe for century through telescope on earth thi hurricane-like storm in jupiter atmosphere be more than twice the size of my planet a a high-pressure region the great red spot spin in a direction opposite to that of low-pressure storm on jupiter it be surround by swirl current that rotate around the spot and be sometime consume by it the great red spot might be a million year old my spacecraft detect lightning in jupiter upper atmosphere and observe auroral emission similar to earth northern light at the jovian polar region voyager return the first image of a faint narrow ring encircle jupiter largest of the solar system planet jupiter rotate at a dizzy pace once every hour minute second the massive planet take almost earth year to complete a journey around the sun with know moon jupiter be something of a miniature solar system a new mission to jupiter the galileo project be under way after a six year cruise that take the galileo orbiter once past venu twice past earth and the moon and once past two asteroid the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into jupiter cloud layer and relay datum back to earth the galileo orbiter will spend two year circle the planet and fly close to jupiter large moon explore in detail what the two pioneer and two voyager reveal galilean satellite in galileo galilei aim hi telescope at jupiter and spot fmy point of light orbit the planet for the first time human have see the moon of another world in honor of their discoverer these fmy body would become know a the galilean satellite or moon but galileo might have happily trade thi honor for one look at the dazzle photograph return by the voyager spacecraft a they fly past these planet-sized satellite one of the most remarkable find of the voyager mission wa the presence of active volcano on the galilean moon io volcanic eruption have never before be observe on a world other than earth the voyager camera identify at least nine active volcano on io with plume of eject material extend a far a kilometer mile above the moon surface io pizza-colored terrain mark by orange and yellow hue be probably the result of sulfur-rich material bring to the surface by volcanic activity volcanic activity on thi satellite be the result of tidal flex cause by the gravitational tug-of-war between io jupiter and the other three galilean moon europa approximately the same size a my moon be the brightest galilean satellite the moon surface display a complex array of streak indicate the crust ha be fracture caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like io europa ha be heat enough to cause it interior ice to melt apparently produce a liquid-water ocean thi ocean be cover by an ice crust that ha form where water be expose to the cold of space europa core be make of rock that sink to it center like europa the other two galilean moon ganymede and callisto be world of ice and rock ganymede be the largest satellite in the solar system larger than the planet mercury and pluto the satellite be compose of about percent water or ice and the rest rock ganymede surface ha area of different brightnes indicate that in the past material ooze out of the moon interior and wa deposit at variou location on the surface callisto only slightly smaller than ganymede ha the lowest density of any galilean satellite suggest that large amount of water be part of it composition callisto be the most heavily cratered object in the solar system no activity during it history ha erase old crater except more impact detailed study of all the galilean satellite will be perform by the galileo orbiter saturn no planet in the solar system be adorn like saturn it exquisite ring system be unrivaled like jupiter saturn be compose mostly of hydrogen but in contrast to the vivid color and wild turbulence find in jovian cloud saturn atmosphere ha a more subtle butterscotch hue and it mark be mute by high-altitude haze given saturn somewhat placid-looking appearance scientist be surprise at the high-velocity equatorial jet stream that blow some kilometer mile per hmy three american spacecraft have visit saturn pioneer speed by the planet and it moon titan in september return the first close-up image voyager follow in november send back breathtaking photograph that reveal for the first time the complexity of saturn ring system and moon voyager fly by the planet and it moon in august the ring be compose of countles low-density particle orbit individually around saturn equator at progressive distance from the cloud top analysi of spacecraft radio wave pass through the ring show that the particle vary widely in size range from dust to house-sized boulder the ring be bright because they be mostly ice and frost rock the ring might have result when a moon or a pass body venture too close to saturn the unlucky object would have be tear apart by great tidal force on it surface and in it interior or the object may not have be fully form to begin with and disintegrate under the influence of saturn gravity a third possibility be that the object wa shatter by collision with larger object orbit the planet unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other individual ring particle appear to be hold in place by the gravitational pull of saturn and it satellite these complex gravitational interaction form the thousand of ringlet that make up the major ring radio emission quite similar to the static hear on an am car radio during an electrical storm be detect by the voyager spacecraft these emission be typical of lightning but be believe to be come from saturn ring system rather than it atmosphere where no lightning wa observe a they have at jupiter the voyager saw a version of earth aurora near saturn pole the voyager discover new moon and find several satellite that share the same orbit we learn that some moon shepherd ring particle maintain saturn ring and the gap in the ring saturn moon wa discover in from image take by voyager in voyager determine that titan ha a nitrogen-based atmosphere with methane and argon one more like earth in composition than the carbon dioxide atmosphere of mar and venu titan surface temperature of degree celsiu degree fahrenheit imply that there might be water-ice island rise above ocean of ethane-methane liquid or sludge unfortunately voyager camera could not penetrate the moon dense cloud continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be convert titan methane to ethane acetylene and in combination with nitrogen hydrogen cyanide the latter compound be a build block of amino acid these condition may be similar to the atmospheric condition of primeval earth between three and fmy billion year ago however titan atmospheric temperature be believe to be too low to permit progress beyond thi stage of organic chemistry the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini mission the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe call huygen which will be drop into titan atmosphere and fall to the surface cassini will use the probe a well a radar to peer through titan cloud and will spend year examine the saturnian system uranu in january fmy and a half year after visit saturn voyager complete the first close-up survey of the uranian system the brief flyby reveal more information about uranu and it retinue of icy moon than have be glean from grind observation since the planet discovery over two century ago by the english astronomer william herschel uranu third largest of the planet be an oddball of the solar system unlike the other planet with the exception of pluto thi giant ly tip on it side with it north and south pole alternately face the sun during an swing around the solar system during voyager flyby the south pole face the sun uranu might have be knock over when an earth-sized object collide with it early in the life of the solar system voyager find that uranu magnetic field do not follow the usual north-south axi find on the other planet instead the field be tilt degree and offset from the planet center a phenomenon that on earth would be like have one magnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of djakartum on the island of java in indonesium uranu atmosphere consist mainly of hydrogen with some percent helium and small amount of ammonium methane and water vapor the planet blue color occur because methane in it atmosphere absorb all other color wind speed range up to kilometer mile per hmy and temperature near the cloud top average degree celsiu degree fahrenheit uranu sunlit south pole be shroud in a kind of photochemical smog believe to be a combination of acetylene ethane and other sunlight-generated chemical surrounding the planet atmosphere and extend thousand of kilometer into space be a mysteriou ultraviolet sheen know a electroglow approximately kilometer mile below uranu cloud top there be think to be a scald ocean of water and dissolve ammonium some kilometer mile deep beneath thi ocean be an earth-sized core of heavier material voyager discover new moon kilometer mile in diameter orbit uranu the five previously know miranda ariel umbriel titanium and oberon range in size from to kilometer to mile acros representing a geological showcase these five moon be half-ice half-rock sphere that be cold and dark and show evidence of past activity include fault and ice flow the most remarkable of uranu moon be miranda it surface feature high cliff a well a canyon crater-pocked plain and wind valley the sharp variation in terrain suggest that after the moon form it wa smash apart by a collision with another body an event not unusual in my solar system which contain many object that have impact crater or be fragment from large impact what be extraordinary be that miranda apparently reform with some of the material that have be in it interior expose on it surface uranu wa think to have nine dark ring voyager image in contrast to saturn ring which be compose of bright particle uranu ring be primarily make up of dark boulder-sized chunk neptune voyager complete it tmy of the solar system with an investigation of neptune and the planet moon on august the spacecraft sweep to within kilometer mile of neptune and then fly on to the moon triton during the neptune encounter it become clear that the planet atmosphere wa more active than uranu voyager observe the great dark spot a circular storm the size of earth in neptune atmosphere resembling jupiter great red spot the storm spin counterclockwise and move westward at almost kilometer mile per hmy voyager also note a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dub the scooter a well a high-altitude cloud over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck the highest wind speed of any planet be observe up to kilometer mile per hmy like the other giant planet neptune ha a gaseou hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior the planet core contain a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other ga giant neptune distinctive blue appearance like uranu blue color be due to atmospheric methane neptune magnetic field be tilt relative to the planet spin axi and be not center at the core thi phenomenon be similar to uranu magnetic field and suggest that the field of the two giant be be generate in an area above the core where the pressure be so great that liquid hydrogen assume the electrical property of a metal earth magnetic field on the other hand be produce by it spin metallic core and be only slightly tilt and offset relative to it center voyager also shed light on the mystery of neptune ring observation from earth indicate that there be arc of material in orbit around the giant planet it wa not clear how neptune could have arc and how these could be keep from spread out into even unclumped ring voyager detect these arc but they be in fact part of thin complete ring a number of small moon could explain the arc but such body be not spot astronomer have identify the neptunian moon triton in and nereid in voyager find six more one of the new moon proteu be actually larger than nereid but since proteu orbit close to neptune it wa lose in the planet glare for observer on earth triton circle neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six day tidal force on triton be cause it to spiral slowly toward the planet in to million year a short time in astronomical term the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it apart form a spectacular ring to accompany the planet modest current ring triton landscape be a strange and unexpected a those of io and miranda the moon ha more rock than it counterpart at saturn and uranu triton mantle be probably compose of water-ice but the moon crust be a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane the moon show two dramatically different type of terrain the so-called cantaloupe terrain and a recede ice cap dark streak appear on the ice cap these streak be the fallout from geyser-like volcanic vent that shoot nitrogen ga and dark fine-grained particle to height of to kilometer to mile triton thin atmosphere only a thick a earth ha wind that carry the dark particle and deposit them a streak on the ice cap the coldest surface yet find in the solar system degree celsiu degree fahrenheit triton might be more like pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visit pluto pluto be the most distant of the planet yet the eccentricity of it orbit periodically carry it inside neptune orbit where it ha be since and where it will remain until march pluto orbit be also highly incline tilt degree to the orbital plane of the other planet discovered in pluto appear to be little more than a celestial snowball the planet diameter be calculate to be approximately kilometer mile only two-third the size of my moon ground-based observation indicate that pluto surface be cover with methane ice and that there be a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface a the planet move away from the sun observation also show that pluto spin axi be tip by degree the planet ha one know satellite charon discover in charon surface composition be different from pluto the moon appear to be cover with water-ice rather than methane ice it orbit be gravitationally lock with pluto so both body alway keep the same hemisphere face each other pluto and charon rotational period and charon period of revolution be all earth day although no spacecraft have ever visit pluto nasa be currently explore the possibility of such a mission comet the outermost member of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planet a asteroid be the rocky and metallic remnant of the formation of the solar system comet be the icy debris from that dim begin and can survive only far from the sun most comet nucleus reside in the oort cloud a loose swarm of object in a halo beyond the planet and reach perhap halfway to the nearest star comet nucleus orbit in thi freeze aby until they be gravitationally perturb into new orbit that carry them close to the sun a a nucleu fall inside the orbit of the outer planet the volatile element of which it be make gradually warm by the time the nucleu enter the region of the inner planet these volatile element be boil the nucleu itself be irregular and only a few mile acros and be make principally of water-ice with methane and ammonium material very similar to those compose the moon of the giant planet a these material boil off of the nucleu they form a coma or cloud-like head that can measure ten of thousand of kilometer acros the coma grow a the comet get closer to the sun the stream of charge particle come from the sun push on thi cloud blow it back like a flag in the wind and give rise to the comet tail gas and ion be blow directly back from the nucleu but dust particle be push more slowly a the nucleu continue in it orbit the dust particle be leave behind in a curve arc both the ga and dust tail point away from the sun in effect the comet chase it tail a it recede from the sun the tail can reach million kilometer million mile in length but the total amount of material contain in thi dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase comet from the latin cometum mean long-haired be essentially dramatic light show some comet pa through the solar system only once but other have their orbit gravitationally modify by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planet these latter visitor can enter close elliptical orbit and repeatedly return to the inner solar system halley comet be the most famou example of a relatively short period comet return on an average of once every year and orbit from beyond neptune to within venu orbit confirmed sight of the comet go back to thi regular visitor to my solar system be name for sir edmond halley because he plot the comet orbit and predict it return base on earlier sight and newtonian law of motion hi name become part of astronomical lore when in the comet return on schedule unfortunately sir edmond do not live to see it a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it pas comparatively close to earth unfortunately on it most recent appearance halley comet pass no closer than million kilometer million mile from my world the comet wa visible to the naked eye especially for viewer in the southern hemisphere but it wa not spectacular comet have be so bright on rare occasion that they be visible during daytime historically comet sight have be interpret a bad omen and have be artistically render a dagger in the sky the comet flyby craf spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleu and remain in proximity to it a they both approach the sun craf will observe the nucleu a it become active in the grow sunlight and begin to have it lighter element boil off and form a coma and tail several spacecraft have fly by comet at high speed the first wa nasa international cometary explorer in an armada of five spacecraft two japanese two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space agency fly by halley comet in conclusion despite their effort to peer acros the vast distance of space through an obscure atmosphere scientist of the past have only one body they could study closely earth but since spaceflight through the solar system ha lift the veil on my neighbor in space we have learn more about my solar system and it member than anyone have in the previou thousand of year my automate spacecraft have travel to the moon and to all the planet beyond my world except pluto they have observe moon a large a small planet fly by comet and sample the solar environment astronomy book now include detail picture of body that be only smudge in the largest telescope for generation we be lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful place and object the knowledge gain from my journey through the solar system ha redefine traditional earth science like geology and meteorology and spawn an entirely new discipline call comparative planetology by study the geology of planet moon asteroid and comet and compare difference and similarity we be learn more about the origin and history of these body and the solar system a a whole we be also gain insight into earth complex weather system by see how weather be shape on other world and by investigate the sun activity and it influence throughout the solar system we can better understand climatic condition and process on earth we will continue to learn and benefit a my automate spacecraft explore my neighborhood in space one current mission be map venu other be fly between world and will reach the sun and jupiter after complex trajectory adjustment future mission be plan for mar saturn a comet and the asteroid belt we can also look forward to the time when human will once again set foot on an alien world although astronaut have not be back to the moon since december plan be be formulate for my return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of mar and even the establishment of martian outpost one day take a holiday may mean spend a week at a lunar base or a martian colony end
