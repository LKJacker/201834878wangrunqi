from wiml william lewi subject re abys breathe fluid los doug los write beside the mechanical problem of move so dense a medium in oan out of the lung diaphragm fatigue etc be there likely to be a problem with the mixture i mean since the lung never expel all the air in them the inhale air ha to mix pretty quickly with the residual air in the lung to provide a useful partial pressure of oxygen right would thi mix be substantially at the pressure we talk about there wa an interest article in scientific american some time ago about breathe liquid it wa a few month before the abys come out a far a i can remember they mention three thing that be difficult to do at once with a substitute breathe fluid low viscosity if it too difficult to force the fluid in out of the lung you ca extract enough oxygen to power ymy own breathe effort let alone anything else diffusion rate obviously not all the air in ymy lung be expel when you breathe out and the part that be expel be the part that nearest the wall of the alveolus alveolu so the trip from the blood vessel to the new air ha to be do by diffusion of the ga through the fluid apparently oxygen tend to diffuse more readily than so even if you can get enough oxygen in you might not be able to get enough out capacity you have to be able to dissolve enough ga per unit volume oh and of course ymy new breathe fluid must not irritate the lung or interfere with their heal or anything like that wim lewi wiml
