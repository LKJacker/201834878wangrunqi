from cohen andy cohen subject report on redesign team the follow be what they fee to u most ha be post already but there be a number of item not see here yet redesign activity update following be the weekly statu on redesign base on information provide by nasa headquarter the station redesign team srt provide a detail statu report to the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april the day-long meet wa hold in anser facility in crystal city va topic cover by the srt include a preliminary mission and goal statement for the space station science technology and engineer research the assessment proces and the design approach discussion on management option and operation concept also be hold the design team then present the three option under study option a modular buildup pete priest present the a option priest say the team be work to define a station that meet cost goal and ha identify three distinct phase of evolution power station human tend and permanent presence the team will define the minimum capability need to achieve each phase the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget level the a option use current or simplify freedom hardware where cost effective and be consider other exist system such a the so-called spacecraft the orbiter and spacelab the power station capability could be achieve in flight with freedom photo voltaic module provide kw of power mission dock to the power station be assume for thi phase human tended capability would be provide by the addition of the common module module which add subsystem and payload rack and dock port for esa and japanese laboratory mission with the orbiter dock to the station be assume for thi phase different mode be be study for thi phase option b freedom derived mike griffin present the statu of option b activity griffin detail the evolution of the freedom-derived option from initial research capability to human-tended capability to permanent human presence capability to two fault tolerance and finally permanent human capability griffin also outline propose system change to the baseline program with minor change to the communication and tracking system crew health care system and ecls and a major change to the datum management system initial research capability would be achieve with flight to degree inclination flight to degree and consist of an extend duration orbiter-spacelab combination dock to a trus segment with photo voltaic array provide kw of power human-tended capability would be achieve in flight and add trus segment and the lab permanent human presence capability would be achieve in flight with two orbiter provide habitation and assure crew return two fault tolerance achieve in flight would build out the other section of trus with another set of pv module thermal control and propulsion system the freedom derive configuration could achieve an international complete state with flight three more flight to bring up the habitat module a third pv array and two assured crew return vehicle acrv would complete the permanent human capability with international stage griffin tell the redesign advisory committee that eliminate hardware would not by itself meet budget guideline for the freedom derive option major reduction or deferral must occur in other area include program management contractor non-hardware early utilization and operation cost he say option c singe launch core station chet vaughn present option c the single launch core station concept a shuttle external tank and solid rocket booster would be use to launch the station into orbit shuttle main engine would be mount to the tail of the station module for launch and jettison after et separation the module foot in diameter and foot long would provide cubic foot of pressure volume separate into deck connect by a centralize passageway seven berth port would be locate at variou place on the circumference of the module to place the international module and other element thi can would have two fix photo voltaic array produce approximately kw of power fly in a solar interial attitude in hi close comment to the redesign advisory committee bryan say a design freeze would be establish for the option on april so that detail cost of the option can begin the next meet with the redesign advisory committee will be may russian consultant arrive in a delegation of russian space expert arrive in the on april and brief to the srt by member of the russian team begin on the the group include russian space agency general director y m koptev and v a yatsenko also of the rsa other on the team include representative from the ministry of defense the design bureau salyut the institute of biomedical problem the ministry of foreign affair npo energium and tsnijmash the russian team brief the srt on environmental control and life support system dock system the proton launch vehicle mir operation and utilization and the soyuz tm spacecraft the russian consultant be available to the srt to ass the capability of the mir space station and the possible use of mir and other russian capability and system a part of the space station redesign they will be available to the srt through may management and operation review continue work continue in the srt subgroup the management group under dr walt brook be work to develop a family of option that solve the current problem and build a foundation for the transition to development and operation variou management option have be develop include lead center with the center director in the programmatic chain of command host center with the program manager report directly to an associate administrator skunk program office with a small dedicate co-located hand-pick program office combine space station with shuttle with the space station become an element of the current program major tune up to current organization with current contract and geographical distribution maintain but streamline the operation group under dr john cox be build on the work of the operation phase assessment team lead by gene kranz of nasa-jsc which have already begin a comprehensive review of operation and have conclude in it preliminary result that significant cost reduction be possible a part of it work the operation group ha identify team of agency expert to develop detail evaluation of each design in the area of assembly and operation utilization maintenance and logistic and test and grind operation what in the week ahead the design support team will provide a comprehensive statu of their option to the station redesign team on monday and tuesday at which point the design will be freeze to begin the detail cost assessment also thi week the team will begin prepare for the next round of discussion with the redesign advisory committee to be hold may dr shea step down dr joe shea step down a director of the station redesign team on april and bryan will take over the activity of the team dr shea submit hi resignation a assistant deputy administrator for space station analysi but will continue to serve a a special advisory to nasa administrator goldin and be available to consult with the srt mr goldin accept the resignation so that a request from dr shea to reduce hi workload could be accommodate key milestone the key date for the srt a they be currently be carry on the schedule be april design freeze on option for costing april design support team present selected option to srt may statu report to redesign advisory committee may interim report by redesign advisory committee june final report to redesign advisory committee oct just my opinion ac
