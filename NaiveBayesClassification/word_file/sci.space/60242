from buenneke richard buenneke subject dc-x rollout report mcdonnell dougla roll out dc-x huntington beach calif on a picture-perfect southern californium day mcdonnell dougla roll out it dc-x rocket ship last saturday the company hope thi single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step toward a single-stage-to-orbit ssto rocket ship the white conical vehicle wa schedule to go to the white sand missile range in new mexico thi week flight test will start in mid-june although there wa a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for ssto research remain cloudy the sdi organization which pay million for the dc-x ca itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle to get the necessary hundred of million require for a sub-orbital dc-xa sdio be pass a tin cup among it sister government agency sdio originally fund ssto research a a way to cut the cost for orbital deployment of space-based sensor and weapn however recent change in sdi political march order and budget cut have make ssto le of a priority today the agency be more interest in use dc-x a a step toward a low-cost reusable sound rocket sdio ha already do brief to other government agency say col simon pete worden sdio deputy for technology but worden decline to say how much the agency would have to pony up for the program i do make colonel by tell my contractor how much money i have available to spend he quip at a pres conference at mcdonnell dougla astronautic headquarter while sdio ha lower it sight on the program orbital objective agency official hail the dc-x a an example of the better faster cheaper approach to hardware development the agency believe thi philosophy can produce breakthrough that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology development worden say the dc-x illustrate how a build a little test a little approach can produce result on time and within budget he say the program which go from concept to hardware in around month show how today engineer could move beyond the miracle of my parent time the key be management worden say sdio have a very light hand on thi project we have only one overwork major jes sponable although the next phase may involve more agency worden say lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial it essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price go up exponentially sdio approach also win praise from two californium member of the house science space and technology committee thi be the direction we go to have to go say rep george brown the committee democratic chairman program that stretch aout to year be sustainable nasa ha learn it yet sdio ha rep dana rohrbacher brown republican colleague go further joking that a shrimp be a fish design by a nasa design team rohrbacher doubt that the program ever would have be complete if it be leave to the civil space agency rohrbacher whose orange county district include mcdonnell dougla also criticize nasa-air force work on conventional multi-staged rocket a place new case around old missile technology let not build fancy ammunition with capsule on top let build a spaceship although rohrbacher praise sdio sponsorship he say the private sector need to take the lead in develop ssto technology mcdonnell dougla which face very uncertain prospect with it transport and space station freedom program be more cautiou about a large private secotro commitment on very large venture company put in seed money say charle ordahl mcdonnell dougla senior vice president for space system you need strong government investment while the government and industry continue to differ on fund for the dc-xa they agree on continue an incremental approach to development citing corporate history they liken the proces to dougla aircraft dc aircraft just a two earlier aircraft pave the way for the transport a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital deltum clipper flight test thi summer at white sand will expand the envelope of performance with successive test increase speed and altitude the first test will reach foot and demonstrate hover verticle take-off and land the second series will send the unman dc-x up to foot the third and final series will take the craft up to foot maneuver will become more complex on third phase the final test will include a pitch-over manever that rotate the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft four-legged land the flight test series will be supervise by charle pete conrad who perform similar maneuver on the apollo moon land now a mcdonnell dougla vice president conrad paised the vehicle aircraft-like approach to operation feature include automate check-out and acces panel for easy maintainance if the program move to the next stage engine technology will become a key consideration thi engine would have more thrust than the pratt whitney engine use on the dc-x each motor use liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant to generate up to pound of thrust based on the engine use in centaur upper stage the model ha a thrust champer design for sea level operation and three-to-on throttle capability it also be design for repeat fire and rapid turnaround worden say future single-stage rocket could employ tri-propellant engine technology develop in the former soviet union the result engine could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitude the mechanism for the team may already be in place pratt ha a technology agreement with npo energomash the design bureau responsible for the tri-propellant and energium cryogenic engine
