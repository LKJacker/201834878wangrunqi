from pgf phil g fraering subject re vandalizing the sky rbunge robert bunge write that fine idea but it only work if the company even bother to supply good light fixture for instance a power company in virginium recently ask a state commission for permission to sell more light of variou type yet all of the different fixture that they sell and want to sell uh why do they have to ask a state commision unles the state buy such a proces will only increace the overhead to the power company of sell different type of light and will decreace the likleihood that they will do so and any efficient light they might have be plan in the future go down the drain be bad design one that waste the light thu you could even buy a good light from them in most place to get a good light you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in arizona you could order it special if enough person do so it would be low cost last i check you could use up to buy stuff in arizona before go there finally i sure ymy state ha thing like small factory and machine shop you could go into busines make light that be cheaper to use thank to their higher efficiency and the fact that they be waste energy on broadcast to space and therefore better than the old style at some point society start to make rule car have to pa safety test five year plan have to be enact or the plan for the economy will fall apart company have to meet pollution standard etc a if the clean air act really clean up the air there be two way to achieve thi educate the public so that they demand good light or force code down the light company back history seem to suggest that the latter be more likely to work my experience seem to suggest that you try too hard to educate them with the same method use in american school to make any subject whatsoever a relevant and bore a proto-ugric instead of sell them on the idea agreed so i wo respond again it important for all you spacer out there to realize that some person will object to variou wild idea that have be present just like congres it would be best to consult the of the night sky before you try some pr stunt to boost public knowledge about space well wake up space be become a field of human endeavor instead of just something we can look at from a long long way away there be practical space project that could conceivably although probably not cause lot of light pollution and have be argue against on those grind even though they might open up such possibility that person could vacation on mar if they want really dark sky bob bunge rbunge phil fraering seem like every day we find out all sort of stuff pgf how the ancient mayan have televison repo man
