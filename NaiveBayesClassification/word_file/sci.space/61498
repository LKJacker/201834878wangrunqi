from prb pat subject re hst servicing mission scheduled for day in article hathaway write after all the space walk they be go to re-boost the hst orbit i think right now it sit at mile up they would like i do know the exact orbit number a ben say thi re-boost idea be all news to u here do you know something we do please supply a source it would be nice for the scheduler of observation to know where the thing be go to be these altitude number be also way off my best source ha minimum st altitude in the pmdb be kilometer maximum st altitude in the pmdb be kilometer deltum st altitude in the pmdb be kilometer pmdb be proposal management datum base use to schedule observation i be sure ymy number be far better then mine a i say above i do have exact number in order to perform the re-boost of the hst the om engine will be fire for a long period now the shuttle be a heavy thing the hst be light either the amount of om fuel need to fly both up be substantial a small booster carry up and use to boost hst on it own will weigh significantly le then the om fuel require to boost both hst and shuttle for a give orbital change could you supply some calculation you might check some recent post that explain that small booster a suggest do not now exist so compare the ma of something that do exist to the ma of the om fuel seem impossible the contamination threat also remain how different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug be from that of the shuttle and it om engine i know that no small manuevering tug exist but maybe one could soup up a bu do anyone out there have the de-clasified spec on hte bu would it be able to provide enough control force to balance the hst and still have the rocket thrust to hurl her into a decent high orbit or the hst could even get place into some sort of medium orbit the reason they want a high orbit be le antenna point and longer drag life longer drag life i can understand but could you explain the antenna point sorry that should be intrument point whatever it be the problem in the tilt array be a big constraint on hst op tell me about it although the array can be and be move perfectly well utilize the second electronic box getting them both work be much desireable so a to reclaim redundancy plu if the second box get fritzy you could be in shitter ville real fast i do mean to jump on you helpful suggestion be alway welcome and we all know the more idea the better but i do want the true situation to be describe clearly and correctly lest some get confuse regard wm hathaway the problem be no-one seem to have the exact number when the mission wa plan originally at spacewalk and astronaut there wa enormou concern over the ma margin for the flight they have now plan for eva an day mission and have reserve eva and an emergency eva obviously that be come from somewhere my gues be the om burn fuel or re-boost margin i just figure if goldin want to really prove out faster cheaper better have some of the whiz kid slap together an expendable space manuevering tug out of a and use that for the re-boost it ha to be better then use the discovery a a tow truck pat
