from leech jon leech subject space faq planetary probe history archive-name last-modified date planetary probe historical mission thi section wa lightly adapt from an original post by larry klae klae mostly minor format change matthew wiener weemba contribute the section on voyager and the section on sakigake wa obtain from isa material post by yoshiro yamada yamada u planetary mission mariner venu mar mercury flyby and orbiter mariner the first attempt to send a spacecraft to venu fail minute after launch in the guidance instruction from the grind stop reach the rocket due to a problem with it antenna so the onboard computer take control however there turn out to be a bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly go off course so the range safety officer destroy it although the bug be sometime claim to have be an incorrect fortran do statement it wa actually a transcription error in which the bar indicate smooth wa omit from the expression r-dot-bar sub n nth smooth value of derivative of radiu thi error lead the software to treat normal minor variation of velocity a if they be seriou lead to incorrect compensation mariner become the first successful probe to flyby venu in december of and it return information which confirm that venu be a very hot degree fahrenheit now revise to degree f world with a cloud-covered atmosphere compose primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid wa later confirm in mariner launch on november wa lose when it protective shroud fail to eject a the craft wa place into interplanetary space unable to collect the sun energy for power from it solar panel the probe soon die when it battery run out and be now in solar orbit it wa intend for a mar flyby with mariner mariner the sister probe to mariner do reach mar in and take the first close-up image of the martian surface in all a it fly by the planet the probe find a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously think many scientist conclude from thi preliminary scan that mar wa a dead world in both the geological and biological sense mariner wa send to venu in it reconfirm the datum on that planet collect five year earlier by mariner plu the information that venu atmospheric pressure at it surface be at least time that of earth or the equivalent of be foot under the surface of an ocean mariner and be send to mar in and expand upon the work do by mariner fmy year earlier however they fail to take away the concept of mar a a dead planet first make from the basic measurement of mariner mariner end up in the atlantic ocean in when the rocket launcher autopilot fail mariner the sister probe to mariner become the first craft to orbit mar in it return information on the red planet that no other probe have do before reveal huge volcano on the martian surface a well a giant canyon system and evidence that water once flow acros the planet the probe also take the first detail closeup image of mar two small moon phobo and deimo mariner use venu a a gravity assist to mercury in the probe do return the first close-up image of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet reveal previously unseen detail in the cloud cover plu the fact that the entire cloud system circle the planet in fmy earth day mariner eventually make three flyby of mercury from to before run out of attitude control ga the probe reveal mercury a a heavily cratered world with a ma much greater than think thi would seem to indicate that mercury ha an iron core which make up percent of the entire planet pioneer moon sun venu jupiter and saturn flyby and orbiter pioneer through fail to meet their main objective to photograph the moon close-up but they do reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon include new datum on the van allen radiation belt circle earth all three craft have failure with their rocket launcher pioneer wa launch on october pioneer on november and pioneer on december pioneer wa a moon probe which miss the moon and become the first spacecraft to orbit the sun in pioneer wa originally design to flyby venu but the mission wa scale down and it instead study the interplanetary environment between venu and earth out to million kilometer in a record until mariner pioneer through be place into solar orbit from to pioneer and be still transmit information at thi time pioneer e would have be number suffer a launch failure in pioneer become the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in pioneer follow it in and then go on to become the first probe to study saturn in both vehicle should continue to function through and be head off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so pioneer venu also know a pioneer venu orbiter or pioneer burn up in the venusian atmosphere on october pvo make the first radar study of the planet surface vium probe pioneer venu also know a pioneer send fmy small probe into the atmosphere in december of the main spacecraft bu burn up high in the atmosphere while the fmy probe descend by parachute toward the surface though none be expect to survive to the surface the day probe do make it and transmit for minute on the grind before it battery fail ranger lunar lander and impact mission ranger and be test probe for the ranger lunar impact series they be mean for high earth orbit test in but rocket problem leave them in useles low orbit which quickly decay ranger launch on january wa intend to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problem during the launch cause the probe to mi the moon and head into solar orbit ranger do try to take some image of the moon a it fly by but the camera wa unfortunately aim at deep space during the attempt ranger launch april have the same purpose a ranger but suffer technical problem enroute and crash on the lunar farside the first probe to reach the moon albeit without return datum ranger launch october and similar to ranger and lose all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually miss the moon and drift off into solar orbit ranger through have more modify lunar mission they be to send back live image of the lunar surface a they head toward an impact with the moon ranger fail thi objective in when it camera do not operate ranger through perform well become the first lunar probe to return thousand of lunar image through lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter through be design to orbit the moon and image variou site be study a land area for the man apollo mission of the probe also contribute greatly to my understand of lunar surface feature particularly the lunar farside all five probe of the series launch from to be essentially successful in their mission they be the first probe to orbit the moon all lo be eventually crash into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the man apollo mission surveyor lunar soft lander the surveyor series be design primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sink into the soil before thi time it wa fear by some that the moon wa cover in great layer of dust which would not support a heavy land vehicle surveyor wa successful in prove that the lunar surface wa strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from to only surveyor and be unsuccessful mission the rest become the first probe to soft land on the moon take thousand of image and scoop the soil for analysi apollo land foot from surveyor in and return part of the craft to earth surveyor the last of the series wa a purely scientific mission which explore the tycho crater region in viking mar orbiter and lander viking wa launch from cape canaveral florida on august on a titan rocket the probe go into martian orbit on june and the lander set down on the western slope of chryse planitium on july it soon begin it program search for martian micro-organism there be still debate a to whether the probe find life there or not and send back incredible color panorama of it surround one thing scientist learn wa that mar sky wa pinkish in color not dark blue a they originally think the sky be pink due to sunlight reflect off the reddish dust particle in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulder stretch out a far a it camera could image the viking orbiter keep function until august when it run out of attitude-control propellant the lander wa switch into a weather-reporting mode where it have be hop it would keep function through but after november an errant command have be send to the lander accidentally tell it to shut down until further order communication wa never regain again despite the engineer effort through may of an interest side note viking lander ha be designate the thoma a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander image team the national air and space museum in washington be entrust with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attach to the lander by a man expedition viking wa launch on september and arrive in martian orbit on august the lander touch down on september in utopium planitium it accomplish essentially the same task a it sister lander with the exception that it seisometer work record one marsquake the orbiter have a series of attitude-control ga leak in which prompt it be shut down that july the lander wa shut down on april the orbit of both viking orbiter should decay around voyager outer planet flyby voyager wa launch september and fly past jupiter on march and by saturn on november voyager wa launch august before voyager and fly by jupiter on august by saturn on august by uranu on january and by neptune on august voyager take advantage of a rare alignment to slingshot it way from outer planet to outer planet voyager could in principle have head toward pluto but jpl opt for the sure thing of a titan close up between the two probe my knowledge of the giant planet their satellite and their ring ha become immense voyager discover that jupiter ha complicate atmospheric dynamic lightning and aurora three new satellite be discover two of the major surprise be that jupiter ha ring and that io ha active sulfurou volcano with major effect on the jovian magnetosphere when the two probe reach saturn they discover over ringlet and satellite include the predict shepherd satellite that keep the ring stable the weather wa tame compare with jupiter massive jet stream with minimal variance a great white cycle be know titan atmosphere wa smoggy mima appearance wa startle one massive impact crater give it the death star appearance the big surprise here wa the stranger aspect of the ring braid kink and speak be both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager thank to heroic engineer and program effort continue the mission to uranu and neptune uranu itself wa highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity wa that it magnetic axi wa find to be highly skew from the already completely skew rotational axi give uranu a peculiar magnetosphere icy channel be find on ariel and miranda wa a bizarre patchwork of different terrain satellite and one more ring be discover in contrast to uranu neptune wa find to have rather active weather include numerou cloud feature the ring arc turn out to be bright patch on one ring two other ring and other satellite be discover neptune magnetic axi wa also skew triton have a canteloupe appearance and geyser what liquid at the two voyager be expect to last for about two more decade their on-target journey gife negative evidence about possible planet beyond pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause soviet planetary mission since there have be so many soviet probe to the moon venu and mar i will highlight only the primary mission soviet lunar probe luna lunar impact attempt in miss moon and become first craft in solar orbit luna first craft to impact on lunar surface in luna took first image of lunar farside in zond took first image of lunar farside in since luna wa also a test for future mar mission luna first probe to soft land on the moon in return image from surface luna first probe to orbit the moon in luna second successful soviet lunar soft land mission in zond first successful circumlunar craft zond through accomplish similar mission through the probe be unman test of a man orbit soyuz-type lunar vehicle luna first probe to land on moon and return sample of lunar soil to earth in luna accomplish similar mission in luna delivered the first unman lunar rover to the moon surface lunokhod in a similar feat wa accomplish with luna in luna last soviet lunar mission to date returned soil sample in soviet venu probe venera first acknowledge attempt at venu mission transmission lose enroute in venera attempt to image venu during flyby mission in tandem with venera probe cease transmit just before encounter in february of no image be return venera attempt to place a lander capsule on venusian surface transmission cease just before encounter and entire probe become the first craft to impact on another planet in venera first probe to successfully return datum while descend through venusian atmosphere crushed by air pressure before reach surface in venera and mission profile similar in venera first probe to return datum from the surface of another planet in venera accomplish a more detail mission in venera sent first image of venusian surface in wa also the first probe to orbit venu venera accomplish similar mission venera returned first color image of venusian surface in venera accomplish similar mission venera accomplished radar map with venera of section of planet surface in more detail than pvo vega accomplished with vega first balloon probe of venusian atmosphere in include two lander flyby bus go on to become first spacecraft to study comet halley close-up in march of soviet mar probe mar first acknowledge mar probe in transmission cease enroute the follow year zond first possible attempt to place a lander capsule on martian surface probe signal cease enroute in mar first soviet mar probe to land albeit crash on martian surface orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red planet in mar first successful soft land on martian surface but lander signal cease after second in mar attempt at orbit mar in brake rocket fail to fire probe go on into solar orbit mar first fully successful soviet mar mission orbit mar in returned image of martian surface comparable to probe mariner mar landing attempt in lander crash into the surface mar lander miss mar completely in go into a solar orbit with it flyby bu phobo first attempt to land probe on surface of mar largest moon phobo probe fail enroute in due to error phobo attempt to land probe on martian moon phobo the probe do enter mar orbit in early but signal cease one week before schedule phobo land while there ha be talk of soviet jupiter saturn and even interstellar probe within the next thirty year no major step have yet be take with these project more intensive study of the moon mar venu and variou comet have be plan for the and a mercury mission to orbit and land probe on the tiny world ha be plan for how the many change in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent state will affect the future of their space program remain to be see japanese planetary mission sakigake wa launch from the kagoshima space center by isa on january and approach halley comet within about million km on march the spacecraft be carry three instru ment to measure interplanetary magnetic wind all of which work normally now so isa make an earth swingby by sakigake on january into an orbit similar to the earth the closest approach wa at on january the geocentric distance wa km thi be the first planet-swingby for a japanese spacecraft during the approach sakigake observe the geotail some geotail passage will be schedule in some year hence the second earth-swingby will be on june at re earth radiu and the third october at re hiten a small lunar probe wa launch into earth orbit on january the spacecraft wa then know a muses-a but wa rename to hiten once in orbit the lb probe loop out from earth and make it first lunary flyby on march where it drop off it lb midget satellite hagoromo japan at thi point become the third nation to orbit a satellite around the moon join the unite state and ussr the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remain in orbit around the moon an apparently break transistor radio cause the japanese space scientist to lose track of it hagoromo rocket motor fire on schedule on march but the spacecraft track transmitter fail immediately the rocket fire of hagoromo wa optically confirm use the schmidt camera at the kiso observatory in japan hiten make multiple lunar flyby at approximately monthly interval and perform aerobraking experiment use the earth atmosphere hiten make a close approach to the moon at jst on february at the height of km from the moon surface and fire it propulsion system for about ten minute to put the craft into lunar orbit the follow be the orbital calculation result after the approach apoapsi altitude about km periapsi altitude about km inclination deg to ecliptic plane period day planetary mission reference i also recommend read the follow work categorize in three group general overview specific book on particular space mission and periodical source on space probe thi list be by no mean complete it be primarily design to give you place to start ymy research through generally available work on the subject if anyone can add pertinent work to the list it would be greatly appreciate though naturally i recommend all the book list below i think it would be best if you start out with the general overview book in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in thi area i also recommend that you pick up some good up-to-date general work on astronomy and the sol system to give you some extra background most of these book and periodical can be find in any good public and university library some of the more recently publish work can also be purchase in order through any good ma market bookstore general overview in alphabetical order by author j kelly beatty et al the new solar system merton e davy and bruce c murray the

voyager and in case the probe be find by intelligence in interstellar space a well a the probe and planetary mission objective themself other work and periodical nasa ha publish very detail and technical book on every space probe mission it ha launch good university library will carry these book and they be easily find simply by know which mission you wish to read about i recommend these work after you first study some of the book list above some periodical i recommend for read on space probe be national geographic which ha write article on the pioneer probe to earth moon luna and the jovian planet jupiter and saturn the ranger surveyor lunar orbiter and apollo mission to luna the mariner mission to mercury venu and mar the viking probe to mar and the voyager mission to jupiter saturn uranu and neptune more detail on american soviet european and japanese probe mission can be find in sky and telescope astronomy science nature and scientific american magazine time newsweek and variou major newspaper can supply not only general information on certain mission but also show you what else wa go on with earth at the time event be unfold if that be of interest to you space mission be affect by numerou political economic and climatic factor a you probably know depending on just how far ymy interest in space probe will go you might also wish to join the planetary society one of the largest space group in the world dedicate to planetary exploration their periodical the planetary report detail the latest space probe mission write to the planetary society north catalina avenue pasadena californium usa good luck with ymy study in thi area of space exploration i personally find planetary mission to be one of the more excite area in thi field and the benefit human society ha and will receive from it be incredible with many yet to be realize larry klae klae next faq upcoming planetary probe mission and schedule
