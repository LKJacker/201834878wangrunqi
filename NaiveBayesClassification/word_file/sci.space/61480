from subject boeing tsto wa word from chairman of boeing game write re response from cob of boeing on ssto a far a single stage to orbit technology we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach and we be talk to some of my customer about that a far a commercialization that be a long way off anybody know anything further is thi really news do thi threaten further work on dc boeing ha be look at several tsto vehicle and ha carry out extensive conceptual study of advance launch system for some time a good reference on thi might be comparison of propulsion option for advanced earth-to-orbit eto application by weldon and fink from boeing the paper describe a propane-fueled tsto launch system claim to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiency without the problem associate with liquid hydrogen fuel basically it a high-speed airplane launch a hermes-type spaceplane the design the concept be also call betum a lay out in the paper can launch at least pound into polar orbit or pound to space station orbit include a crew of eight person and life support system design reliability be betum be a first stage power by two large ramjet and high speed civil transport hsct turbofan a long reusable orbiter be trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first stage aircraft which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage to launch the orbital vehicle the first stage take off like a normal hsct and accelerate to mach at that point the turbofan modify to burn catalyze would shut off and the ramjet would take over at mach the orbiter or the elv would swing out ignite and proceed to orbit both vehicle would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective mission estimated total weight of the combine configuration at takeoff be about m lb roughly equivalanet to a fully load the orbiter stage weigh about klb include klb of lox and subcooled propane to power two klb vacuum thrust rocket engine propellant would be store at degree kelvin with the propane in a spherical tank mount forward of the cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station lox would be store aft weldon and fink claim the key to thi design succes be the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allow by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel the paper compare tsto design to ssto design they conclude while a ssto ha a slightly lower recur cost a tsto be easier cheaper and le risky to develop simpler to build ha greater safety and mission versatility and do carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel the conlcude in conjunction with it major use of airplane type engine and fuel a well a it inherent self ferry capability it be probably the system most likely to provide a close to airline-like operation a possible with a practical configuration until a single stage concept can be show to be operationally viable is thi really news do thi threaten further work on dc weldon and other at boeing have be work on tsto design for some time i expect thi or a similar concept perhap the hthl ssto they propose for the sdio ssto first phase be be re examine a a basi for a bid on the first phase of spacelifter do it threaten dc possibly there be a set of on-going study try straighten out the government future space transportation strategy mdc and boeing a well a other firm be provide datum to a joint study team back in dc there be variou faction and option vie for attention include shuttle upgrade shuttle replacement what wa call the architecture spacelifter elv upgrade and variou advance vehicle ale betum dc nasp fst ssto of several type etc be try to put together a coherent strategy for future u space transportation system and try to juggle near-term launch need like for dod and nasa against medium-term need include commercial consideration and against the investment and risk of go to leap frog new technology like and nasp and betum it a heck of a problem the worst part of the problem be that there be promise idea and concept there be dozen of them but how they balance cost and risk versu real need in the near term they should have a draft report in mid-june with a final report come by the end of the fiscal year wale larrison space technology investor maximu
