from isaackuo isaac kuo subject re drag-free satellite in article thomsonal write on sat may gmt henry henry spencer say no a dragles satellite do not magically have no drag it burn fuel constantly to fight drag maintain the exact orbit it would have if there wa no drag well almost it turn out that clever orbital mechanic can engineer thing so that resonant interaction with the higher order harmonic of the earth gravitational field can pump energy into a satellite and keep it from experience drag effect for period of month to year a harmonic of the earth gravitational field what is a harmonic of the earth gravitational field my favorite example of thi be the heavy elint satellite of the cosmo clas which be in resonance in resonance with what it not like there any wavelength or frequency to the earth gravitational field now there might be some interest interaction with the moon tidal effect be that what you talk about thi probably ha little relevance to space station since the degree orbit of the satellite be at km which be unacceptably far into the inner van allen belt for man platform but it kind of interest from the point of view of the physic of the situation what be the physic of the situation the only way i can see gravitational effect be useful in add energy to an object orbit earth be some sort of interaction with the moon isaac kuo isaackuo o twinkle twinkle little sig keep it le than line big
