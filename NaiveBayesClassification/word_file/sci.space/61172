from josh hopkin subject dc-y trajectory simulation i be to three talk in the last month which might be of interest i transcribe some of my note below since my note take ability be by no mean infallible please assume that all factual error be mine permission be grant to copy thi without restriction note for newby the deltum clipper project be gear toward produce a single staget to orbit reusable launch vehicle the dc-x vehicle be a scale vehicle design to test some of the concept invovled in ssto it be currently undergo test the dc-y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reach orbit it ha not yet be fund on april rocky nelson of macdonnell dougla give a talk entitle optimizing technique for advanced space mission here at the university of illinoi mr nelson job involf use software to simulate trajectory and determine the optimal trajectory within give requirement although he be not directly involve with the deltum clipper project he ha spend time with them recently use hi software for their application he thu use the dc-y project for most of hi example while i do think the detail of implicit trajectory simulation be of much interest to the reader i hope they be i fell asleep during that part i think that many of you will be interest in some of the detail glean from the example the first example give wa the maximization of payload for a polar orbit the main restriction be that acceleration must remain below gs i assume that thi be drive by passenger constraint rather than hardware constraint but i do not verify that the deltum clipper y version ha engine booster and sustainer the booster which have a lower isp be shut down in mid-flight thu one critical question be when to shut them down mr nelson show the follow plot of acceleration v time g a ascius graph go thi be actually fairly good the big difference be that the line g make by the should be curf which be concave up the datum be only approximate a the graph wa up for very long g g sec sec a mention before a critical constraint be that g level must be keep below initially all eight engine be start a the vehicle burn fuel the accelleration increase a it get close to the booster engine be throtled back however they quickly become inefficient at low power so it soon make more sense to cut them off altogether thi cause the dip in accelleration at about second eventually the remain sustainer engine bring the g level back up to about and then hold it there until they cut out entirely the engine cutoff do not acutally occur in orbit the trajectory be aim for an altitude slightly higher than the desire and the last vestige of air drag slow the vehicle slightly thu lower the final altitude to that desire question from the audience paraphrase q would it make sense to shut down the booster engine in pair rather than all at once a very perceptive worth consider they have not yet do the simulation shutting down all fmy wa part of the problem a give q so what wa the final payload for thi trajectory a ca tell u read aviation leak he also apparently have a good propulsion example but wa tell not to use it my question do anyone know if thi security be due to sdio protect national security or md protect their own interest the second example wa reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver the biggest constraint in thi one be aerodynamic heat and the parameter they be try to maximize wa crossrange he show graph of heat use two different model to show that both be very similar and i think we be suppose to assume that thi mean they be very accurate the end result wa that for a polar orbit land at ksc the dc-y would have about degree of crossrange and would start it reentry profile about degree south latitude i would have ask about the land maneuver but he do know about that aspect of the flight profile josh hopkin find a way or make one attribute to hannibal
