from baez john baez subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article steinly steinn sigurdsson write in article att prb pat write what evidence indicate that gamma ray burster be very far away their distribution be very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speak indicate we see an edge to the distribution how can you tell the difference between an intensity distribution which be due to an edge in the spatial distribution and an intensity distribution which be due an a sharp dropoff of intrinsic luminosity below a certain threshold could you describe roughly what the intensity distribution be like
