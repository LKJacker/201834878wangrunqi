from prb pat subject gamma ray burster where be they what evidence indicate that gamma ray burster be very far away given the enormou power i wa just wonder what if they be quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic range my own pet theory be that it flying saucer enter hyperspace but the reason i be ask be that most everyone assume that they be collide nuetron star or spin black hole i just wonder if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in pat
