from ragraca randy a graca subject re wing will win gballent greg ballentine write all of thi be fine i never say that murray wa a bad gm i merely say that he be the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor if murray be a great a you claim the wing would have win the stanley cup by now probably more than once if he wa a great a gm a you claim i think you miss one of my point there it take more than a great gm to win a stanley cup even once some of the guy on the list you give earlier never win one i agree that you and i could probably argue back and forth for day to no avail about who be the best gm in hockey that be a matter of opinion and who be to say my opinion be any better than your or your than mine but the point of my original original post if not well state wa that murray ha the gm ability but not the coach ability which lead to below and he wa a poor a coach a you claim he would have be intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of succes i think at thi point there a personal emotional element involve here which transcend murray logical think a outsider it fine for u to say he should hire a different coach in fact he ha talk about do so in the past but the pres here in detroit at least ha so build up thi busines about murray never get past the second round of the playoff a a coach that i think he ha take it upon himself to prove to the world that he be capable of coach a team past the second round he need to a the paper say get that monkey off hi back so it become a matter not of intelligence but of pride is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic perhap but we all a little that way from time to time i think eventually he step down from behind the bench and concentrate on hi gm duty and the team will improve a a result i think hi coach duty take away time he might have otherwise spend on gm work in that sense once he step down a coach we see how good of a gm he really be but murray be an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm so none of thi be true anyway i may not agree with everything you say but it be fun discuss it with you gregmeister randy
