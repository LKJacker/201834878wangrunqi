from nlu nelson lu subject shark review part defenseman peter ahola season acquired trade with pittsburgh for future consideration grade i b it be way too early to tell about ahola who wa acquire probably because the penguin figure that they would lose him in the expansion draft ahola have only play game thi season i think it actually le the san jose mercury news may be in err here of them with the shark in the game he ha play he appear quite solid defensively although he ha be spectacular and hi offense be anything to write home about point it even possible that the trade may be for future consideration which turn out to be peter ahola doug wilson season acquired trade with chicago for rw kerry toporowski and round pick in entry draft grade i b i have often be accuse of overly down on wilson i may have have too high expectation for him but hi leg knee et al be give out nevertheles when he wa play he exhibit a strong shoot and playmaking ability even if he ha lose a step on defense which unfortunately he demonstrate thi year a well a at time he wa slow to catch the opponent forward and hi offensive output wa only good enough for place on the team point in game but next year which may be wilson last if he can stay healthy he can still be a contributor dean kolstad season acquired from minnesotum in dispersal draft grade i it probably somewhat unfair for me to judge kolstad on just a handful of game forget exact number but no more than but at age he quickly run out of time if he want to make it to the nhl in those game he do not impres anyone after generate shoot in the first period of the first game he play he score just point in hi tenure up here with the shark and wa even le impressive defensively a he appear awkward with hi movement and wa prone to giveaway he need to make a leap in hi level of performance to have any chance of make the team pat macleod season acquired from minnesotum in dispersal draft grade i macleod wa on the roster a lot longer than kolstad but it appear to my memory that he play le than kolstad because the shark be reluctant to use him but be even more reluctant to send him to the minor figure that he would clear waiver in fact he ha play the past week with kansa city but be still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment a rehab assignment that will include him play in the turner cup playoff since he ha play so little i ca even give a tentative grade on him but he demonstrate last year excellent offensive skill but terrible defensive skill tom pederson season acquired from minnesotum in dispersal draft grade i b called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corp wa decimate by injury pederson impress many shark fan here on net include your truly he demonstrate very good offensive skill score point in game however hi size lb be of concern and soon after he begin to shine offensive do team begin to push him around physically on both side of the ice although he have appear fearles in hi approach but to be successful he probably need to bulk up to have a fight chance on survive against some of the bigger player in the league claudio scremin season acquired from minnesotum in dispersal draft grade i he play all of game in the league thi year but wa thoroughly umimpressive just a he wa at the end of last season again it may be a small sample but just a in the case of kolstad scremin at age be quickly run out of time he wa not a contributor on either offense or defense in the game he play with the shark the only notable thing that will go down in scremin entry of league stat be probably the fact that he wa once trade for now capital goaltender don beaupre go calgary flame al macinni for norri gary robert for hart and smythe go edmonton oiler go for playoff next year stay in edmonton nelson lu claudiu contact for the san jose shark
