from dchhabra deepak chhabra subject re vlad playoff pick in article cunews vzhivov vladimir zhivov write wale conference adam division semifinal boston v buffalo the bruin be play some excellent hockey and with cam neely back and moog hi old self again thi should be a cake-walk bruin in i hop for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the series goaltending be about equal top offensive player be about equal mogilny-lafontaine v oates-juneau but buffalo ha no answer to neely not to imply that neely be not a top offensive player btw in fact he one of my favourite even though he a damn bruin and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favour boston anyway but i think it will go six quebec v montreal thi one be very tough to call montreal certainly ha the experience factor but quebec be more talented imho it come down to the goaly i go with experience and roy canadien in agreed here but montreal will be push to the limit is it just me or do everything montreal do in the playoff come down to roy go hab final boston v montreal will bruin domination continue in thi rivalry ye moog ha consistently outperform roy in the playoff after other stuff bruin in five i ca predict a montreal victory because i be watch them play for week and imo they severly need some tougher player especially to play in the garden last time they beat the b but boston have a clear territorial advantage the victory wa roy at the same time i ca bring myself to predict the possibility of a los so i just say i will not be put money on thi series patrick division semifinal pittsburgh v ny islander what can i say the pen be fly high and have the most talent in the league agreed ny do have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have give pittsburgh thi year pen in five which be credit to ny washington v new jersey capital in agreed here too but i think it will go at least six jersey ha a decent team and washington ha do poorly against the division thi year pittsburgh v washington if the cap have bill ranford i might see an upset but don beaupre just do inspire my hope penguin in i think they will use tabaraccus more after beaupre get shell i do think it will go six either maybe five conference final pittsburgh v boston a replay of last year the penguin be just a good a month ago and the bruin be much improve but penguin in if pittsburgh play boston imo they win in likely five possibly six they own the bruin if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once again i wo be put money on the seventh game i say seven because the hab have play pittsburgh very tough thi season campbell conference norri division semifinal chicago v st loui or minnesotum blackhawk in chicago will win but i think in at least six chicago be not that good imo and remember that they take ridiculou number of penalty detroit v toronto the leaf have have an excellent season but they be play playoff hockey all year the hab under burn be the same way and alway wilt in the playoff red wing in very true the leaf have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why montreal do so lousy in the playoff toronto might win two or three at mlg though wing in six maybe even seven final chicago v detroit thi will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wing in it will be a war possibly the most intense playoff series of them all and ye i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big though smythe division semi-final vancouver v winnipeg canuck in my first disagreement canuck be play like shit they do use their size at all which may explain why they get hammer by a team chase them calgary winnipeg in six calgary v lo angele thi would have be tough to call except for three thing the king do have a goalie gary robert will be back the king shoot themself in the foot by trade a prove winner paul coffey for a prove loser jimmy carson gretzky be just too weary to carry thi group flame in thi be also tough for me to call because i have see the smythe enough i do think robert will be well enough to figure in coffey be a non-issue who care what carson ha do before and never underestimate gretzky la in six final vancouver v calgary flame in if it be these two calgary will not need six game but i think it will be la-winnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice coference final detroit v calgary red wing in wow must be tough to go against ymy team but let see i pick la-detroit detroit will win probably in six stanley cup final pittsburgh v detroit three in a row and official statu for the pen or can the wing complete a dream season well the wing be better in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have better d-man however mario and the boy can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoff though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him the pen be just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher battle to get here penguin in if pittsburgh play detroit it will go longer than five and i would bet against the wing they be very strong imo and nobody know how strong because they be underachieve most of the year if force to choose though i have to take the penguin a side note vlad last week you say that selanne wa a better player than gilmmy no way he be a more talented pure goal scorer but aside from the age difference there be no way i would take him over gilmmy on my team i not ask for flame either btw i spend more than enough time argue on behalf of selanne and i still say he a great player but while he and gilmmy be both dangerou offensively give teemu an edge gilmmy do it all i know a lot of gilmour-bashing go on esp from flame fan but imo you guy be let ymy dislike of gilmmy cloud ymy judgement when it come to hi skill he be easily one of the best all-round player in the nhl dchhabra
