from joseph b stiehm subject bruin come on boston where the hell be you seven win in a row and what choke i much rather see the bruin in the wale conference final v pitt than buffalo or quebec if only because it would be more interest not that buffalo or quebec ca put up a good fight but i much more enjoy a paste of the bruin than the devil you have to feel for terrerrus sp ah well maybe the devil will pull it out or maybe the pen will lose in the second round but if not i hope the bruin be there to meet them
