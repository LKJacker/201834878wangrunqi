that almost create a goal he have the puck in the top of the leave offensive circle all alone but instead of take the shoot he find crash the net on the other side a perfect pa and a good shoot acros daren puppa body should have be a goal but puppa make a great save read the play garry galley give the maple leaf rank power play the first chance when he hook doug gilmmy at the flyer lowly rank penalty kill unit wa almost flawles the entire game and set the tone on thi kill the maple leaf get almost nothing but long unscreened shoot and the defense sweep away every rebound after the power play the flyer get a goal on an ugly play rod give the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he send a drive at the net puppa make the save and kick the rebound right into the foot of josef beranek and bob rouse who be wrestle in the slot beranek wa able to get hi stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who wa skate into the slot from the right circle and he lift a backhander over puppa for a flyer lead at the flyer keep the pressure on and puppa wa the only leaf keep the flyer from build on their lead for a while eventually thing settle down and defense prevail each team get an occasional score chance but the goaly be strong bowen start give some lindros-like check in hi own corner then lindro who wa look to avenge a hit foligno give him think he have a chance to even the score he have foligno line up at center ice lean into him and ride him into the center ice board the only problem wa that foligno wa a little far from the board and mike mister mcgeough felt that it warrant a board call at the leaf could get anything go on the power play a the flyer be very aggressive for a change on the kill with time run out in the period recchi carry through the neutral zone and hand to lindro a they approach the leaf blue line they be in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindro try a backhand pa to recchi through the foot of macoun that connect to recchi but then clark check recchi off the puck macoun then try to clear but it wa weak and go right to mcgill who have man the point he drive it from just inside the blue line macoun get hi stick on it and deflect it past hi own goalie at shot be flyer in the period the flyer finally get their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk trip up rod in hi offensive zone during the power play the flyer get cheat a little when the puck pop up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough think it hit hi stick above hi head we could see from my seat at the other end of the ice that it only hit hi glove and the replay confirm but the faceoff go to the other end a time wa run out in the advantage lindro find galley with a pa acros the goal mouth but puppa make the save the rebound kick back to the right corner where recchi pick it up pass it out to eric crash through the right circle and eric one-timed past puppa at with the assist recchi move past bobby clarke season the second best one season total for a flyer at eric move up to all time in flyer rookie score with point mike eastwood take down al conroy at to give the flyer another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley end the power play with a slash at not much happen on the on although the leaf have most of the possession the flyer smother the leaf short power play temper flare a little at bowen and pearson get rough minor keith acton get a bloody face dave mcllwain then take a dive and get greg hawgood a hook minor at to set up a on the replay show that hawgood stick stop make contact with mcllwain long before he spin around and fell again the flyer smother the leaf power play lead by dimitrus yushkevich bowen make a thunder hit when he come out of the box on pearson berehowski try to perplex everybody with hi sloooowball he have the puck at the point and just trickle a pa down the slot he make all the flyer look silly a nobody could get a stick on it and it get to gilmmy at the side of the net but soderstrom stone him the flyer pick thing up offensively after the kill wa over but do get anything home shot be flyer the flyer be content with the goal lead in the third period and they decide that if tommy want a shutout he wa go to have to work for it a little the flyer get most of the score chance in the first or so minute of the period but could get past puppa then the leaf get tire of lindro make road kill out of them and temper flare each for doug gilmmy and lindro unsportsmanlike conduct and each for glenn anderson and mcgill rough all at terry carkner then take a kneeing penalty at on gilmmy again the flyer smother the leaf power play at about the minute mark dave andreychuk get a shoot away from hi leave circle that get through soderstrom the puck wa roll on it side and a luck would have it it turn away from the net instead of turn toward it think of how a roll quarter inevitably start to lean one way or the other second later rod trip up gilmmy at to give the leaf another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stone andreychuk while lie down andreychuk get the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it go straight through and wa sweep away by one of hi defenseman they keep the pressure on but soderstrom wa equal and preserve the shutout recchi cro check ken baumgartner to get temper hot and start a brawl at no punch throw recchi get the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindro each get rough minor at rouse and beranek express their mutual dislike for each other and get each for slash to set up another on mike eastwood shove down ryan mcgill in the flyer zone a they be battle for the puck and while mcgill wa down he run hi stick acros mcgill face the flyer be not happy with that at all al conroy pair up with berehowski and start throw punch upward well al hold hi own much to the delight of the crowd each get a couple punch in before go down in a head and al get a stand o penalty eastwood cro check game clark carkner each berehowski and conroy each fight at so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyer the have no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and play catch until hawgood find dineen all alone in the leave circle he control the puck and blast it past puppa at that wa all the firework tommy soderstrom would not face another shoot puppa do but keep the flyer off the board flyer shoot be flyer in the probably the strongest game i see from the flyer since the all star break shutout number for soderstrom all since tied for most in the nhl but he play fewer game than belfmy or the goalie i ca remember that he tie with next up it the winnipeg selanne tuesday night in winnipeg the flyer can not be eliminate if they win but a los couple with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end flyer up to point on the season in game last year they have point in game under so they need at least point in their last game to improve on that only by percentage point under in be better than under in tragic number hold at point with game leave the tragic number for be point i watch the ranger blow a third period lead at home to lose before i finish thi up why point instead of well the flyer will win the tie-breaker if they catch them wherea the islander win tie breaker against the flyer and so need only a tie the ranger could crumble down the stretch a they play the devil the pen twice the flyer and finish up with game against the cap so i gues place could be the goal for the team to focu on flyer team record watch
