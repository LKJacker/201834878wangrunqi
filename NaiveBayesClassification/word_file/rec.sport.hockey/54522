subject makarov from in article nlu nelson lu write i think the shark should dig into the free agent market most of the good free agent will require quite a bite of compensation and set the shark back a far a player development go remember the shark be unwilling to give up player s in addition to the million they offer for joe murphy and i think that a good approach they try to sign sergei makarov before thi season because makarov would have require compensation matching the makarov offer wa the only real mistake dave king ha make thi year i have to wonder about the intelligence of sign a old who be obviously on the downside of hi career to a million contract risebrough match the offer on king request and makarov ha spend the last quarter of the season in the pres box because hi work ethic just plain stink not to mention that he lose a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty pas i think makarov will be available for free thi offseason to anybody who agree to pay hi contract he ineffective in calgary but he might be able to help a team like san jose with their shortage of talent if there no taker and makarov do show improvement in train camp i think the flame will just bite the bullet and buy out makarov contract and release him with hi current attitude he be a detriment to the team alan
