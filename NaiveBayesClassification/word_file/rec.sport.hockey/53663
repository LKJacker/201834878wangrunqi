from gballent greg ballentine subject re wing will win in article ragraca randy a graca write i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they face them in the final which be what all the detroit sportswriter be predict although i think bryan murray be probably the best gm i have ever see in hockey how do you figure that when bryan murray take over the wing they be a pretty good team that wa contend for the stanley cup but look unlikely to win it now they be a pretty good team that be contend for the stanley cup but look unlikely to win it a truly great gm would have be able to make the move to push the team to the upper echelon of the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup a good gm like murray can maintain the team succes but ca push them to the next level in the history of hockey there have be several better gm than murray way too many to name murray be even the best gm in the league today he fail in comparison to sinden sather savard caron fletcher and quinn in my estimation i ca imagine how bryan murray can be the best gm anyone ha ever see in hockey unles they have see very few gm gregmeister
