from dchhabra deepak chhabra subject superstar and attendance wa teemu selanne wa leader dean j falcione post from write i write when the pen get mario grant there wa big publicity etc etc and interest wa immediately generate gretzky do the same thing for la however imnsho neither team would have see a mark improvement in attendance if the team record do not improve in the year before lemieux come pittsburgh finish with point following hi arrival the pen finish with and point with a couple of stanley cup throw in it wa at thi point the pen attendance wa near capacity out of sellout yet they have make the playoff since how do you explain a place team break attendance record when they have be to the playoff in year mario lemieux be the explanation imho you could make a case that the expectation of an improve team that would make the playoff be the reason funny you should mention it thi be exactly the case i wa go to make but i think the reason be lemieux have a point season and wa the first non-gretzky to win the hart and ros since person turn out to watch him play i will grant that a star like mario will draw fan even if the team suck but thi be short term only i still do not think the attendance increase will last unles the team be a one pittsburgh wa still get better so person continue to support them if they suddenly drop to say point you have knee surgery for some of the person jump off the bandwagon also the follow year the pen have point not ok my number come from the nhl guide and record book they make the transaction to try and build a winner around mario that be true but the improvement in attendance come before they start do thi coffey late in and before they even have a playoff bind team a double of attendance occur in from the previou year an increase from point to point be not go to do that the arrival of mario lemieux be what do it you can give the credit to mario since he deserve it but my point be that it wa mario himself but it wa the expectation of thing to come a win team that he create by be the next great hockey superstar and before anybody jump in and say i nit-picking and mince word go back and read from where thi thread start it might help to think about what would go through a fan mind who suddenly find an interest in mario and the pen wa it gee mario lemieux be amaze i go watch him play or wa it gee now we get a kick a guy on my side i go watch him play i think it wa the latter similar thing happen in before gretzky arrival about per game after constant sellout they be still sell out every game despite show little or no improvement since gretzky first year there how do you explain it person be go to see gretzky they certainly be go to see a winner they have got a winner they have much better team in their past history than they currently have yet they do draw a well then i do think thi be accurate the ticket sell but person do go to the game i think thi thread ha already be discuss season ticket holder in la do alway use their ticket so in effect after the king initial succes follow gretzky arrival to point same source and correspond attendance jump there ha be an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sale may not have change much whether or not the king be a be debatable i claim that since gretzky arrival they have at the very least be competitive i also claim that mcnall ha make a stupid move in try to reassemble the oiler dynasty but that another story and include only because i do like mcnall anyway mcnall do do some heavy market around gretzky and that undoubtedly wa also responsible for the attendance and merchandise sale etc but a i say when the king have be in there little tailspin over the past couple of year there have be empty seat at the forum even if the ticket be sell i think in the case of a lemieux or gretzky the player can transcend win a the major draw power for the short term imo although i think that it inevitable that the team will improve with a player such a lemieux or gretzky simply because they make person around them better but win sure a hell help well at least we be in full agreement here thi do not make roger point any more valid but the jet be so be you say roger ha ever have a valid point could resist get a huge jump in productivity yet they are get a huge jump in attendance thi be due to the emergence of teemu selanne they have the best record in hockey it sure a hell be because they be win ye but they be do no worse than last year i think the same type of reason i apply to a new pittsburgh fan apply to all the extra person show up at winnipeg game it difficult to predict but do you think that if the jet mi the playoff next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance level i seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improve team would be go with or without selanne i do provide the example of rocket ismail and the toronto argonaut of the cfl do you leave it out because you do know much about the cfl if that the case then fair enough but if it be the case then i curiou to hear ymy explanation
