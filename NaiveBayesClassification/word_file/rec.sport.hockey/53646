from mamatha devineni ratnam subject atlantum hockey hell well it not that bad but i be still pretty piss of at the local abc coverage they cut off the first half hmy of coverage by play david brinkley at instead of an earlier time slot i do even understand their problem if they didnt think enough person would not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game and if they show the remain hour of the game would it hurt to play david brinkley at it regular time they dont have any decent program before noon anyway i call the sport dept and blast them on their machine i call gain and someone pick it up when i ask him why they premepted the first half hmy of the stanley cup playoff he seem a bite confuse when i explain a bite more in detail he then say that upto to my program dept call back on monday weel i understand that the sport dept be not responsible for thi preemption but i ca understand how someone in the sport dept ca even recognise the name of playoff show on the very same station he work for anyway i be go to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again i urge all atlantum hockey fan to call wsb and ask them not to do the same thing for the next week pravin ratnam oh by the way pen rule
