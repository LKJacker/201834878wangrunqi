from anna matya subject re ron franci matthew rush write is there an award for best back-up behind a hockey great underneath all the hype about lemieux steven jagr ulf etc ron franci ha quietly put together a point season goal and assist in game that wa probably the best acquisition the penguin have make since get lemieux apology to rick tocchet who ha have a hell of a year himself the pen get just the right person at just the right time when they get franci before the playoff two year ago to back-up mario who wa the second-line center before they get franci i remember randy gilhen who really play tough an ace in the face-off circle but nobody with all the skill franci ha score pass win face-off and put into every game every night just want to glow a little i know what you mean i glow everytime ronnie out on the ice in fact one of the neatest thing about see the pen in person be that i can key in on him instead of watch what i probably be see on tv he do so many subtle thing behind the play he say in an interview recently that when he wa a kid hi dad stress the importance of play two-way hockey that you have to learn how to play defense a well a offense and he obviously take that advice to heart he wa a breath of fresh air when he arrive in pittsburgh to the team whose forward for the most part could and would play a lick of defense it really difficult to ass what the key trade be that bring all of thi succes to the pen you mention rick tocchet and he ha certainly help and even ol kjell ha be steady but look at thi team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it would matter if i have to pick the top three acquisition in recent year they would be tom barrasso ron franci larry murphy i love to put franci first but i do think the only thing that could really damage the pen right now would be to lose barrasso mom
