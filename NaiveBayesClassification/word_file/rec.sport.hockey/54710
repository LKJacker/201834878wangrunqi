from karim edvard ahmed subject re minnesotum shame i be under the impression that minnesotum wa one of or possibly the hockey state in the so why be the team move to a city in texa is it that the owner be a greedy self-serving profiteer or be the star really not make a profit or wa the city or whoever own the arena do some price gouge norman green claim that he ha lose money over the last three year that he ha own the team when he buy the team it seem kind of obviou that he wa go to have to deal with a few year in the red before the team start make a profit again he give the impression that he wa will to do so he claim two year ago that the team need to average only fan per game in order to pull a profit but thi season the team average fan despite increasd ticket price i think the team attendence and play wa clearly in an upward trend which leaf me dumbfound a to how he could ignore that in decide to move he wa even offer the many concession he rudely demand such a guarantee season ticket sale cheap rent at the other two arena in town etc oh well i gues the bottom line be green want immediate huge return in dalla and wa will to wait another year or so in mn dalla give green a pretty stellar deal to play there although i feel minnesotum wa quite reasonable and he also ha some crony down there a well all thi mean be that minnesotum be without an nhl team for a year or two too bad for the nhl kea
