from steveg steve gallichio subject re nhl team in milwaukee charlie betz cbetz write after read some of the report of possible nhl move to milwaukee or that milwaukee should have an nhl team i think i pa along a story i hear recently thi be second hand so i do know how true it be but i have no reason to doubt it either bradley center in milwaukee be home to the milwaukee admiral minor leauge hockey team the owner of the admiral sorry i ca remember hi name either own or at least shell out the majority of the fund to build the bradley center lloyd pettit supposedly he wa approach by the nhl about an expansion franchise but turn it down because he think the franchise fee of million wa too high like i say i do know whether thi story be true or just a rumor but if it true do look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon the admiral be go to be force out of the build and you wo see an nhl club and a minor league club in the same build especially since the nba milwaukee buck play there a well ye it be true that he refuse to buy a franchise from the nhl for but at the time the reason wa that the establish market for team wa much le than that he felt that no one would pay for an expansion team and that he would simply wait to buy an exist franchise for le than that but the market fool him and team have be create for apiece in the last three year and even the exist team ca be move for le than and i doubt that he could get one for that little pettit gamble and lose now he have to pay more sg
