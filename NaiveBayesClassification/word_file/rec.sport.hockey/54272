from chuq chuq von rospach subject re shark kingston fired snichol sherrus nichol write in article klh steve steve cole write i think the three-headed gm guide principle wa to keep veteran in favor of youngster only if they offer a significant advantage do sound like a bad strategy to me no and in fact that wa ferreira original strategy which the troika proceed to simply continue to implement there wa exactly a radical shift in policy when he wa oust something person seem to forget the only real question be whether they do it a well a ferreira could have if he stay or whether the basic strategy wa flaw since ferreira ha be quoated a say he go to do something different in anaheim with the duck my gues be that it wa a good in practice a it wa on paper and he tweak it a bite second time around one also ha to wonder whether the strategy would have be a lot better if we have have those injury and whether we complain about the weather because an earthquake collapse the root cellar of course ferreira have also trade a number of veteran with marginal contribution before he wa fire so it not clear that thi would have be different beside they be marginal contributor let also not forget that ferreira come thi close to trade kelly kisio which if the rumor i hear be true wa over the strong objection of other aspect of shark management and probably have a lot to do with both hi ouster and the three-headed consensu orient gm imagine for a second where the shark would be today if that fax machine have jam with or without mullen they be go to be a playoff team what good do it do them to hang onto a player who rather be elsewhere especially an unhappy player that be play a well because of it not that i accuse mullen of tank but hi motivation simply wa there and that kind of thing can affect the team an example from thi season skriko wa bring in on a trial basi but not keep because of hi age i think he wa a decent contributor worth keep around the youth movement ha it advantage look at gaudreau who might still be in kc if more veteran have be keep around but you have to find the right balance right balance for what that the issue exactly at the time they let skriko go we have yet have the major injury bug that kill u later i much rather have skriko around than someone like dean kolstad but at that point that wa the choice and since the choice wa more one of skriko v someone like john carter i think the right choice wa make for that time period chuq imho von rospach esd support training chuq member sfwa editor otherrealm genie alink chuq minor league fan minors-request san jose giant san francisco giant fan giants-request the stick not san jose shark fan sharks-request new seat
