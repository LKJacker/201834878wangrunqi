from hallg the terminator subject re espn in article randolin robert andolina write the thing that confuse me most about espn be that they decide to show the penguin and devil again on thursday night being that both of the first two game be dominate by pitt you would think that they would show a different game thi be in addition to the fact that they should show other game just for the sake of fair exposure espn must have some very poor market person they be only concern with feature player mario than feature good competitive hockey also some of you should know that a far a i can tell espn be not go to show campbell conference game regularly in the first two round i believe that they be only go to show campbell game in the first two round a those series wear on game or perhap game i hear that thi be because most of their market be east coast and hence would prefer the wale stuff also do expect canadian team on espn in summary if you want to see a network that provide good hockey coverage watch cbc from canada they may be bias toward canadian team but they do treat the viewer like idiot they provide nice update and don cherry will alway provide a few laugh
