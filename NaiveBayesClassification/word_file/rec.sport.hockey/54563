from leunggm gary leung subject fuhr deserve credit wa sabre sweep fuhr role in article lzuo joseph write in article randolin robert andolina write many person have suggest that fuhr play be the only reason that the sabre beat the bruin while fuhr wa a critical factor i would not overlook the fact that the sabre finally get some score from person other than mogilny and lafontaine khmylev sweeney hawerchuck etc indeed lafontaine play hurt and do score many goal also the team play better defense although not great than in the regular season fuhr deserve a lot of credit but not all of it robert a i agree with thi i also think fuhr contribution for sabre win be just the same a many palyer in the team mogilny have six goal in fmy game include two goal for the great comeback in the final win after fuhr have leave the key for sabre win over boston be whole team strong commitment a an underdog and all their talent player include mogilny and fuhr i think that grant fuhr deserve more credit than that while it true that the entire sabre team play very well i still believe that if it wa for grant fuhr the series would now be tie he virtually steal game and for the sabre in both of these game fuhr stand on hi head to give the sabre the chance to win especially in game fuhr make a series of huge stop in the third period when the score wa tie even in game when the sabre win the score seem to indicate that the sabre dominate however if it have be for fuhr the sabre would have be up i think it wa through the period and the bruin would have have to open up the game thereby allow mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game there be no doubt in my mind that fuhr wa the critical factor in the victory in my opinion neely oate and juneau play a well a lafontaine mogilny and hawerchuk the sabre do get extraordinary effort from hannan sweeney wood and khmylev compare to that of the bruin checker however the bruin defense imo play better than the sabre defense the sabre have ken sutton play a regular shift afterall the difference in the series wa fuhr who outplay andy moog gary go sabre
