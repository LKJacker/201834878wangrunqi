from jmd subject re flyer re thi year biggest and worst opinion in article seth write so in other word if roussel shut out the shark and soderstrom shut out the penguin that immaterial because it wa the coach decision come on joe think about what you say who they play be very significant why they play them be what irrelevent a low gaa against good team be better than a low gaa against bad team in the context of compare two goaltender a low gaa be better then a higher gaa a low gaa against good team be much much better than a higher gaa against bad team in the context of compare two goaltender let start over i not argue about who be the better goaltender i take soderstrom right now what i be say be that roussel can be a netminder the gaa difference be le than half a goal per game le than that after last night their save percentage be close and their record be similar and with that i just do see how you can label roussel a the most disappoint player on the flyer thi season you say soderstrom play against better competition that may very well be but there be no way of know how roussel would have perform in those game beside against the better score team like pittsburgh the defense be more key up than they be against san jose the same for roussel in the ranger game two real score chance one he make a great play the other he wa save by a mistake from the other player if you be judge roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by but i not just judge roussel on that game alone i see him play for the past two season in philly and before that in hershey it just my opinion but i think he get what it take of course i think that about mark laforest too but i never do about wendell young so i bat in judge hershey talent since the hextall-era a for the ranger game you can say he wa save by a mistake by the offensive player if you like but rou have hi leg in position to make the save if he do it would have matter if the ranger player do get the puck up or not it would have be a goal on a breakaway that what the goalie want to do take away a much a possible and force the shooter to beat him but if you be to look at the tie against the hab you saw a goalie stand on hi head to get that shutout that wa a goalie in action roussel do have a game like that in him i seem to remember roussel do an excellent job against pittsurgh on open night to give the flyer a tie against the two-time defend champ and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he wa senational in that game again the hab but you ca tell me that a montreal player have an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out miss it mistake both on offense and defense be part of the game or there never be shutout anyway i happy the flyer have both soderstrom and roussel and i not go to argue about it anymore beside with the current win streak and expectation soar for next year i do want to pi you off to the point that you do sell me any ticket next season joe dake at t microelectronic union boulevard allentown pa let go flyer jmd jmd
