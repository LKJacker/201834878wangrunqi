from robert angelo pleshar subject barasso the cheap shoot master after watch the pengiun all year and a many other team a possible i really notice an increase in tom barasso cheap shoot thi year and not notice a corrsponding increase with other goaltender i also notice that he usually get away with it just a example last night i notice him elbow scott steven in the head which basically start the whole shove match that get steven scott and tocchet minute minor he also kicked john mclean of course he wa call for that is kick an automatic match penalty and game suspension i think glenn anderson get one a few year ago for kick gaetan duchesne in the chest there no doubt in my mind that barasso be the dirtiest golatender since hextall he also very good how about that tocchet head-butt is there an automatic susppension that go along with a non-kicking match penalty i ca remember anymore oh the playoff should be fun ralph
