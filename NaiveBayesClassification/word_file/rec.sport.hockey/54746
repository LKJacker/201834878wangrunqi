subject re wing news and playoff thought from kwolfer in article kcsmith smith write i do think he show that he good enough to carry detroit to the cup the team may be good enough to reach the final but chevelda be their achille heel you must have goaltending in the playoff and chevelda look like an overmatched or stringer which he probably i gues i do know of too many or string goaly that could post over win in a season chevy ha do that the past two season play behind a defense that be not exactly the best in the league hi win thi year be not all against toronto and for those who look at vincent rien stat and think he should be start take a look at the team he play against team like san jose ottawa and tb any nhl goalie could post a decent record play team like that night in and night out be look for detroit management to remedy the situation in the offseason i really do see thi happen if they do think chevelda could do the job they would of trade for somebody thi year after all why wait until next year when there be goaly available thi year hey i may be wrong but after watch him kick rebound after rebound into the high slot i do think he can carry them in the tough game those not against toronto better to kick out rebound than to let goal in if st loui get past chicago watch for joseph to carry the blue past an otherwise vastly superior red wing club joseph be hot but so be the wing they have score six goal in both of their game so far with toronto supposively one of the league best defense i gues if they end up play for the norri title we see what happen the devil advocate drinkin woman gun do mix awkorbut mark arm kc wing in or hopefully by a far a chevelda be concern he be a decent goalie the most logical trade in the offseason to me would be between detroit and ny ranger i sure if beezer would be trade he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to hi root in detroit he would be a valuable asset to the wing and perhap the ranger could get a zombo in return beezer get a few good year in him and the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize hi play
