from dmsilev daniel m silevitch subject re utility for update and in article oddjob andrew c stoffel write in article write unles i be completely misunderstand you try use either notepad or find in ymy system subdirectory to edit you ini file you can add sysedit regedit to a program group they be window program the program be cool because it automatically open you and file to be edit is it possible to get it to load other ini file no when the program be run it load configuration file and there be no open entry on the file menu you can only edit these fmy file if you need to edit some other program ini file use notepad or some other ascius editor i wonder whether microsoft intend for sysedit to be use or if it wa just a holdover from the test period and they forget to take it out the reason i think thi be because there be absolutely no mention in the manual about thi program and there be no online help for it just an about entry under the file menu the program look like something that wa intend for internal use only it kind of a shame though it would have make a nice multi-file replacement for notepad daniel silevitch dmsilev massachusett institute of technology
