from rsrodger yamanarus subject re challenge to microsoft supporter in article bferrell brett ferrell write in article lude larry lude ludwig write munch you must of read too many advertisement crash protection be such a market gimick it be funny out of month of use window on my new machine i only have it crash once and i do have a run of the mill configuration munch follow be reformatted it do sound funny i will admit but for me it be true window crash on all of the time and from what i have read in pc mag thi be not the exception i say that the massive crash problem be exceedingly rare window itself almost never crash but it can be crash by an errant application my personal favorite any one of the corel program on the other hand i have have crash randomly a number of time mostly just run it own application for instance today i discover a new one while i wa download with procomm plu for window run seamles with the standard vga driver on a run-o da mill vga card i decide that i want to edit a copy of a quote that i want to add to my finger but since i learn not to really trust seamles i fire up a full screen session whoop the download finish while wa load it have just get the pointer up so i hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop i have a lot of font so load take a good long while blam screen trash procomm hang up hm well i can sortum see the mouse so i click on the minimize session and get back my fullscreen window session but the color be off red and green and yellow and brown instead of blue and grey so i close thi and get back to the desktop now fully restore pp wa still sit window open but it wa no longer connect to the com port so i exit it the normal way it tell me i wa still online and it would hang up though it wa already hang up hm well load anothe no bad idea shutdown and reboot ok refresh first now shutdown ye everything be close hm nothing seem to be happen let see ah the window list still come up ok let try shutdown again no go huh alright wait second to see if it just run slow hmm still seem to be run try shutdown again nothing oh well reboot enjoy the checkdisk time in thi case a part of the o crash not only itself but entirely which be even smart enough to tell when it s be compromise i gues in everyday specifically today use gife each window app a vdm and they ca touch each other or generally anything they be suppose to have that the idea anyway in truth when a program crash on it will bring the system down with it the program that would just gpf under window do the same under but program that be fine under do and window bring scream to a halt task protection or no for instance i still wonder why print preview in a windowed wp do lock up my system it work fine under do or even in a do box under window admittedly it do crash if i run full screen but the first time thi bug big me it bite hard if window work for you then great maybe thi be why some person do see why be the o of choice if window do crash on you and you do mind wait on each task please explain the only time i wait on anything under window be when i copy or format a floppy or when print and even then not long i get to page dump to the printman per minute and can still go do thing slowly while it do thi i download with pp while print and not be able to adres ymy memory better than do not sure what you mean here see meg use or six of these for it own use more if you want to count window see meg use or more like if you count the disk cache a i be for for itself if memory efficiency be a big issue pc geo would be the current king of the intel desktop some of the key reason for use be go i probably would still use it but it would be more of an even fight on the other hand i be finally able to say with some confidence that both and window have a bite of hardware sensitivity to them for instance the machine i be sit at run both fine while the machine next to me constantly lock up under window but run without a hitch once i get it through a install on the whole i say be a whole lot more sensitive than window but there be i suppose machine that window just do like wittism of th week i think that it wrong to believe in an ism you should believe in yourself ferrish bueller wa thi ferri bueller there be stupid law and then there be stupider than normal law
