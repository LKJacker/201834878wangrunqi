from ashok ashok aiyar subject setting up a slip client under do and window long i have be post monthly how-to-setup a slip client on a pc post for a few month lot of work and imminent graduation have come in the way of post one of these for march or earlier thi month for which i apologize thi file include information on write a script for university of minnesotum phone and also a batch file hack that let you use other packet driver with phone for addition modification and correction i can be reach at ashok best wish ashok begin based on my experience on set up slip under do and window here be my comment on set up slip in thi environment i thank the trumpet betum tester and the cwru slip betum tester for their comment configuring ymy modem a turn off dtr at w i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use to dial my slip server qmodem drop dtr when i exit the program and therefore hang up the line if you use a program like kermit or conex to establish the slip connection then thi need not be do these program do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit note if you use univ of minn phone to dial and establish a slip connection you do not need to turn off dtr b dial and establish the slip connection first thi can be do automatically if you use a program like phone from the university of minnesotum which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the slip packet driver the phone script language be simple and phone script can be easily write to configure phone to work with other slip server in addition while the only packet driver that phone work with be umslip currently it be easy to write a batch file hack that let phone work with other packet driver there be a section on phone in the document with both script and batch file example configuring the slip driver there be five slip packet driver commonly available peter tattam compress slip driver peter tattam slip driver crynwr driver i like phil burn modify driver crynwr driver ethernet simulation over slip univ of minnesotum driver base on of these fmy i vastly prefer over or for the follow reason a it be much faster even though my modem ha just a uart b while use myself and several other have notice that the pc clock get mess up after perform a long ftp transfer c it support pktmux when use in ethernet simulation mode d when use in ethernet simulation mode seem to work with every application that i have test it with instruction for and you do not use phone a load slipper in ymy file accord to instruction for instance if you have a modem on slipper b if you use do application in win do box then use the double-ended packet driver shim thi create a virtual packet driver at do application in native mode do application in window do box and window application can all use thi virtual driver at c if you use load next be configure in to use the interrupt at instruction for a try get a version slip driver philip burn of northwestern university ha a modify driver that be better at hardware handshaking thi driver be distribute along with nupop b load the driver after establish the slip connection my modem be a modem on so here be how i would load the driver w h slip c a discuss above if you use do application in window do box you probably want to use d if you use load instruction for if you choose to use instead of the instruction be exactly the same with one crucial difference you will have to delete the line from the section of thi will interfere with run regular window comm application such a crosstalk and you will get lot of drop character etc in these application thi be therefore not recommend etherslip would be load a ethersl w h configuring window a make the follow modification to the file section i list all ymy com port with their address and interrupt thi can also be do from within window control panel but double-clicking on the port icon ius give the port to which ymy modem be attach a generou com buffer iius change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish to use for ymy modem to zero thi be the amount of time that window wait in second before hand control of that com port to another application if you use and then want to switch from one session to another and thi value be at the default value of second you be will get a gpf and window will crash thi can also be do from within window control panel double-click on enhanced and under device contention set the device contention for the com port ymy modem be on to never warn additional note what to do if you be assign a different ip addres for each slip session i be fortunate in that my campu slip server assign each user a permanent ip addres so i do not have worry about edit each time that i establish a slip connection if you be assign a new ip addres on every occasion that you dial in please try to use bootp aware software and let bootp do the configuration for you however qvtnet be not bootp aware and rarp will not work over a slip connection to get qvtnet work in a situation such a thi you must do the follow edit the file let the net section look like thi net name ip or whatever be appropriate for you or whatever be appropriate save the change and then write-protect thi file attrib r start ymy slip connection and remember the name and ip addres that you be assign each time you start the general configuration dialog box will open enter the name and ip addres and you be assign for that session click on ok and you should be up and run the change you make will not be save a be write-protected a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip addres assignment be provide by victor menayang victor victor use the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation bootpq be use to inquire the assign ip which be then save to a file call myip another file noip be essentially a complete file that lack the ip addres in the final step myip and noip be copy into a single file an example of victor batch file be provide below slipper bootpq i ip s myip bootpq i my ip be s copy q net myip noip e del q myip echo off echo echo ready to run winqvtnet for question and more detail about bootpq please contact victor menayang victor qpc software be attempt to add bootp capability to how do you use pktmux over slip pktmux will not work over the packet driver and crash immediately if use with pktmux will work with when be use in ethernet simulation mode an example of thi configuration be show below the latest release of pktmux be and it be important that you use thi version if you want to use virtual packet driver with application like trumpet for window to be release very shortly from lh ether packet driver lh pktmux pktmux load for virtual packet driver lh pktdrv first virtual packet driver use for lh pktdrv pktdrv for use in native do or wintrumpet additional virtual packet driver can be load directly from within window do box for example my pif file to load popmail be direct to the file thi be what read like pktdrv load a virtual packet driver at cd popmail popmail cd pktdrv u unload the packet driver at exit cause the do window to close i have similar batch file that load other do application like pc gopher it be my experience that pktmux work fine even if the virtual packet driver in two independent virtual do session be load at the same software interrupt for example within two different do box one for popmail and the other for gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv be load at in each instance how much do pktmux degrade the performance of i have a modem in a run window with a reasonably fast video card atus graphic ultra under these condition when i have three virtual packet driver load and be use a follow a driver at qvtnet ftp client session b driver at in one do window cutcp session c driver at in another do window trumpet for do i get ftp transfer rate of while transfer compress file thi rate be comparable to that which i get with load a a packet driver and where a single session be active if cslipper be use a packet driver and a single session be active i get transfer rate of on the same file while there be about degradation in the performance of slipper for me the benefit of be able to use pktmux outweigh the performance hit and ethernet simulation mode in ethernet simulation mode ver work with all the application that i have test it with one or two application that require ethernet simulation balk at but even these rare problem have be resolve with ver when slipper be use in ethernet simulation mode and use with pktmux i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that read ip incorrect packet type or ip bad version number thi do not seem to prevent qvtnet from function although i can not comment on los of performance what can you do if ymy do application do not work with in ethernet simulation mode in the rare event that you find a package that do not work with in ethernet simulation mode first contact the author peter tattam peter and let him know chance be that he can fix it in the meanwhile you can try the follow i do not know if it be kosher but it work when i have problem with ver be load at a describe above under the pktmux section i load at run the application and then terminate thi also work within window virtual do box however a packet driver like ethersl can be use in only one virtual do box at a time so for example here be my batch file to run grateful med a medical reference retrieval program develop at the national library of medicine ethersl w h load etherslip cd search cd termin terminate etherslip exit close the do box and return me to window if you use thi method be cautiou about one thing do have any active pktmux do session open at the same time after close the ethersl window you can run ymy pktmux do session with no problem btw the example above grateful med work with no problem with ver phone script file the documentation that accompany phone provide good instruction on write script file to get phone to dial slip server other than the university of minnesotum server for example here be a script that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend background to start a slip connection i dial my terminal server and login with a username and password after do so i start a slip session with the follow command slip follow by my password again here then be the relevant portion of the script file slip login script by ashok aiyar last revise procedure timeout terminal server be not respond message slip login script version message for slip server to respond quiet on expect message for user verification received from message ymy user name and password quiet off expect send u expect private send p reject deny user name or password wa not accept timeout server do not respond to ymy validation request expect send timeout server do not respond to slip command expect hostname or addres send timeout server do not respond to hostname reject ip addres hostname expect send p reject deny not accept timeout expect compression will match ymy system message to cwru slip server successful wait endprocedure procedure nothing special need to be do to logout endprocedure end of script file how to use packet driver other than umslip with phone the quick answer there be no clean way below be a batch file hack that i write to use phone with other packet driver in thi example the packet driver be peter tattam cslipper to use a batch file like thi you must know the parameter with which you plan to use the packet driver interrupt vector baud rate port addres and irq thi batch file require and to be in the same directory or in ymy path all that the batch file do be to let you dial the slip connection use phone load the appropriate packet driver hangup the connection and unload the driver when you be do be echo off rem thi batch file be an ugly hack of u of minn rem await a version of that can directly interact rem with phone rem file be use with to start a slip rem connection on rem last modify ashok aiyar echo off cl goto start start if goto help if help goto help if setup goto setup if dial goto forced if hangup goto forceh if quit goto forceh if help goto help if setup goto setup if dial goto forced if quit goto forceh goto bogu goto unload forceh termin umslip nul phone force hangup goto unload slipper termin rem the follow line must be change to reflect the com port rem irq baud rate and software interrupt lh c ether goto end forced termin umslip nul phone force dial goto slipper setup termin umslip nul phone setup goto help unload termin goto end bogu echo be not a valid command echo try cwruslip help for a list of valid command echo help echo echo case western reserve university slip setup echo use univ of minnesotum phone echo echo cwruslip setup modem set phone number username etc echo echo cwruslip dial dial and establish the slip connection echo cwruslip quit hangup the phone and unload the driver echo cwruslip help thi screen echo end end where to get what peter tattam program be archive at and the trumpet set of program be generally archive at most window ftp site include ncsa telnet be archive at nupop be archive at slipdisk phone and pc gopher be archive at end ashok aiyar mail ashok department of biochemistry tel cwru school of
