from s beckhau subject re wp-pcf linux risc in article eugene write in article ghhwang ghhwang write dear friend the risc mean reduce instruction set computer the risc usually ha small instruction set so a to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some book about computer architecture for more information about risc hmm not that i be an authority on risc but i clearly remember read that the instruction set on risc cpu be rather large the difference be in address mode risc instruction set be not a orthogonal be cisc i hope thi will clear it up taken from one of my lecture note the alternative approach to cisc which ha be adopt by many in recent year ha come to be know a risc the reduced instruction set computer thi can be characterise simply a simpler be faster by simplify the design by reduce the variety of instruction address mode the hardware can be design to run faster even at the cost of need more instruction the same task can be do more quickly by the simpler faster design a typical risc processor will o provide a large number of register o perform all datum operation on register o provide few address mode immediate or offset o only allow load store operation to acces memory o only use a few instruction format o only support a few datum type integer unsigned float steffi beckhau janet if the odd be a million to one against something occur chance be it will
