from chen chih-keng chen subject control system analysi update for mathematica announcing a symbolic control system analysi package version no user fee release for mathematica version or higher introduction be set of package and notebook for classical control and some modern state space control analysi and design method the notebook in follow a typical control engineering i course teach at many university around the world for the level undergraduate there be no fee to use but certain responsibility be expect of the user see copyright notice in the readme file include below for starter e-mail fax mail post the registration form include in the readme file be available vium anonymou ftp from internet no in the pub directory a typical ftp session in unix be give after the readme file future release if you would like to receive update and newer version of please send to the addres below in addition ymy comment and suggestion be appreciate and be invaluable to u we will do my best to fix any report bug however we can not fix those bug that have not be report to u and those we do not know of we would very much appreciate you take a few minute to communicate to u vium e-mail u mail telephone fax thi will help u to release bug-free version in the future comment be welcome n sreenath system engineering department case school of engineering case western reserve university

without specific without prior permission case western reserve university make no representation about the suitability of thi software for any purpose it be provide a be with out expres or imply warranty acknowledgement support from cwru information and network service dr ray neff case alumni association the lilly foundation and the system engineering department of case western reserve university be gratefully acknowledge special thank to brian evan of georgia tech for all the help ftp be available by anonymou ftp from internet no a sample ftp session be give at the end of thi file change in version update from to in thi version we have revise to take advantage of the more robust signal process function available in mathematica since mathematica provide a better and work laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function than mathematica do we adopt them thi ha make smaller thu brian evan signal processing package that support the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function in the be no longer need directly by for power user who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very fine brian evan package on signal processing available at the anonymou ftp site or ip on the downside the disadvantage of thi update can be that mathematica require more runtime resource than it previou version for mathematica user we have include the laplacetransform package from mathematica in the directory please move all file and directory under into the calculu directory under mathematica package directory introduction thi be an unsupported release of a control system analysi package for symbolic control system analysi use mathematica classical control system analysi and design method and some modern control system method have be implement in thi package thi package and the attendant notebook be develop on a next tm computer a unix base workstation they have be use a a supplementary teach aid along with standard control engineer text ogatum phillip and harbor for undergraduate course in control engineering i teach at the system engineering department of cwru in addition to the next they have also be test successfully on apple macintosh computer tm and ibm pc tm run m window tm we would be very much interest to hear from you if you or anybody you know use thi software on platform not mention above ibm user however will have to evaluate the notebook first to visualize the graphic once instal see below for instruction thi collection of mathematica package can be load by any user bundled with the package be many notebook which demonstrate the functionality of these package the notebook follow a plan of many fine standard undergraduate control engineering text book list in the reference example use in these notebook have be collect from the variou reference give at the end of thi file the content of the notebook in the directory be give below begin content notebook file name chapter introduction to control system section analyticity pole and zero signal forward laplace transform inverse laplace transform differential equation with zero-valued initial condition differential equation with initial condition notebook file name chapter mathematical modeling of dynamic system section ode to state space linearization of a nonlinear system of equation state space to transfer function notebook file name chapter transient-response analysi chapter split into three sub notebook because of file size notebook file name section time response analysi first order system second order system third order and higher order system notebook file name section first order system step response v time const notebook file name section second order system step response v damping ratio notebook file name chapter steady-state response section routh stability steady-state error analysi notebook file name chapter root-locu analysi notebook file name chapter frequency-response analysi section bode plot analysi magnitude v phase plot nichol plot polar plot nyquist plot combined example notebook file name chapter state space method section introduction state transition matrix controllability observability output controllability pole placement design observer design time response using state space method end notebook content compressed file the file that contain a complete set of the package and notebook for mathematica be compress tar file for unix system compress sit file for macintosh system and encode by binhex format require the shareware stuffit file v or higher zip file for the ibm pc run ms-do once expand the mathematica file can also be use on macintosh ibm pc unix system also installation of o in unix command line type the follow command zcat tar xvf o in macintosh open the file use the shareware stuffit v or higher o in ibm command line type the follow command pkunzip o d note thi zip file wa zip by zip utility you must use pkunzip version or higher to unzip it ibm pc may limit the directory name character to eight in that event type pkunzip o d you can also unzip the file on any unix machine if you have unzip utility on it uncompressing and untarring or unzip will create a directory call once the file be expand you should see a single directory contain the follow three file fmy sub-directory and their content sub-directory in cosypak contain control tool box package manual manual in p rtf txt and wn format contain notebook contain laplace transform package from mathematica for mathematica user file in directory cosypak file in directory file in directory sub-directory in common file in directory common important the notebook example file ma file will be under the directory to use the notebook move the directory cosypak to a directory that mathematica can recognize on a unix machine mathematica package on an apple macintosh c on an ibm pc at the begin of the initialization cell of each notebook in directory we list the example about how to make mathematica identify the directory initialization of path example for a unix machine default path example for an apple macintosh path mathematica package example for ibm pc path c change the pathname accord to ymy machine by remove the mathematica comment sign and before and after path set thi command make mathematica recognize the directory on a unix machine mathematica package on a apple macintosh c on an ibm pc mathematica user we include the laplacetransform package from mathematica in the directory please move all file and directory under into the calculu directory under mathematica package directory getting start after installation start mathematica and open the notebook in the directory all notebook load their own package navigate in the notebook and enjoy ibm user however will have to evaluate the notebook to visualize the graphic user responsibility we request you to take a few minute and fill out the information below and mail it to u by e-mail fax mail thi will help u to keep ymy abreast of the improvement and release new version of suggestion for improvement be welcome cut here ymy name organization title e-mail postal addres comment suggestion cut here mail thi information to e-mail fax mail internet sree mail prof n sreenath tel system engg crawford hall fax case western reserve univ cleveland oh report bug please report bug and leave comment to the addres above any suggestion for improvement and criticism be welcome we will do my best to fix any report bug however we can not fix those bug that have not be report to u and those we do not know of we would very much appreciate you take a few minute to communicate to u vium e-mail u mail telephone fax thi will help u to release bug-free version in the future disclaimer and future release thi software be the property of the case western reserve university use thi software at ymy own risk we make no expres or imply warranty the package and the notebook can also be make to run under mathematica version or lower with modification we do not guarantee the outcome documentation function be index in the file in the manual directory accord the chapter usage be illustrate in notebook reside in directory if ymy computer do not support notebook find a macintosh computer and acquire mathreader which be a public domain notebook reader mathreader will at least allow you to peruse notebook but you will not be able to evaluate any code fragment reference dorf r c modern control system sixth edition addison wesley new york fortmann t e and hitz k l an
