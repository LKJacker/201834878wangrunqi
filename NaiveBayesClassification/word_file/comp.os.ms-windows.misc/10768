from jl jerome schneider subject re question about do external join command in article the author write i be set up my box on a ide and a scsi drive and wa wonder about the use of the ms-do join command i like the way it set thing up since i wo have to stick with the c d e crap that do enforce i like how it would mimic mount point of unix filesystem i have hear that there be problem with use it or at least under older version of do please tell i have be use the join command for many year now mostly with good succes in duplicate unix-style file mount you will hear lot of person curse join because they confuse it with the do append command a truely gnarly hack but do believe them you also will hear person say that microsoft recommend that you not use join but in microsoft window workgroup resource toolkit the follow appear join an ms-do utility work fine with window for workgroup if you do not change the state of the join drife during a window for workgroup session thi include add or remove join drife from within window for workgroup we recommend that you do not use join when run window setup or window for workgroup within thi caveat join appear to be valid under window however i have find a couple of application that do deal well with filesystem that have be mount use join in particular the worst offender be word for window it get very confuse when you edit and then try to save a file on a join drive it want to create the save file a in the current dir then delete the old file and rename the file to the doc file unfortunately wfw usually write the file in some idiotic place other than the current directory often in the root dir of the join filesystem but not alway then after delete the original doc file it ca find the file to rename it unles you search ymy disk system the document be go i have also find subtle problem use the mk toolkit from a do box when joined filesystem be present i use to join c temp with a ramdisk but mk sometime get confuse when do an l on the c temp dir and miss some file in the temp dir thi be difficult to reproduce but it go away totally when join be not use i think thi be a window problem rather than mk since it work ok under raw do so i would suggest that you can use join but be aware that it may not be a robust you would like would it be real great to mount network drife z under the main file tree rather than have all those darn drive letter unfortunately join wo let you do it there wa talk on the net about a simple patch to let join work on network drife but i do remember the source it too bad the join command be not better implement since it would avoid use all those stupid drive letter i realize that messdo wa mean for casual even ignorant user so mount all the drife in one file tree might be confuse but it look like m be go to carry thi over into window nt another o mean for casual even igorant user not with all it old family system baggage maybe m need a recovery group so they can get on with life jerome jerry schneider domain jl aspen technology group uucp uunet csn atglab jl po box ft collin co voice
