from dsiegel seagull subject re wp-pcf linux risc the risc mean reduce instruction set computer the risc usually ha small instruction set so a to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some book about computer architecture for more information about risc hmm not that i be an authority on risc but i clearly remember read that the instruction set on risc cpu be rather large the difference be in address mode risc instruction set be not a orthogonal be cisc there be some thing you might be interest to know about today risc processor it be true that there be fewer instruction but what be not commonly know be that thi cause the size of ymy executable to swell so that in some case performance be similar for larger application a a compromise many risc processor today be actually a cro between a reduced instruction set and a complex one thi be not to say that there be no future in cisc processor intel ha certainly prove that what i want to know be what do thi have to do with thi group dave subject re wp-pcf linux risc newsgroup reference from article by eugene in article ghhwang ghhwang write dear friend the risc mean reduce instruction set computer the risc usually ha small instruction set so a to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some book about computer architecture for more information about risc hmm not that i be an authority on risc but i clearly remember read that the instruction set on risc cpu be rather large the difference be in address mode risc instruction set be not a orthogonal be cisc some person say it fun but i think it very seriou eugene dave siegel president rtd system and networking inc president uofaz hardware and computing knowledge society hack dsiegel dsiegel dsiegel
