from glazer subject local window v shared window discussion i would like to see a seriou discussion on the best way to install window from a novell administrator point of view i just get off the phone with m acces support and wa tell that they microsoft ha decide to implement a a standard for software support the local setup describe below a the most advantageou installation if thi be true and microsoft deem thi to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but i like to hear it from administrator first the local window installation window be fully instal on each workstation hard drive assume the resource be available from a network administrator implementation would install all window disk on a network drive use then install window on a basis by run setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drife in thi way all driver be available to the setup procedure the need to change disk advantage reduce traffic running window locally reduce network traffic due to the local acces of main window file network independence if the network fail and they all do at one point or another the local installation would allow user to keep produce and reduce the cost of down-time faster window theoretically window will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network thi may be a hard point to prove if the network ha an optical backbone the network drife be significantly faster acces than local one a user travel from machine to machine do not need to worry about vary setup monochrome color type of mouse etc since the window installation be assign to the workstation disadvantage cost installing window locally require a significant amount of disk space workstation now must be purchase with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from to percent administration local window installation be very difficult to administer new driver for peripheral be constantly be make available each of which would have to be individually instal on each workstation security user now have acces to erase or corrupt their own system file from simple ignorance thi could result in quite a headache for administrator who may have to constantly repair damage installation backup we all know the problem back up local hard disk the backup set if do vium a centralize tape system get very large very quickly backup individually to floppy may not happen at all thi may be eliminate if it be assume that local hard disk only contain replaceable application and not user datum the shared window installation window be fully instal to a network disk vium the procedure describe above user or administrator then install a minimal set of file to individual user directory these directory may be on a local hard disk or perhap a network home directory the bulk of the window system file be maintain on the network in a single directory some file and be access share as-needed by user throughout their window session the user file consist of a small set of file that the user ha update during window session these include group file ini file and other regularly update file advantage a single location for all file make update to drife easy a an update driver become available it only need to be instal in thi single directory for all user to be able to take advantage of it assuming that the user file be maintain in network home directory the administrator can easily edit any ini file as-needed to correct problem that may arise thi include and backup of all pertinent file be do easily even if the user file be on a local hard disk the bulk of the window system be back up with all driver update disadvantage network traffic since all window file be be share in a network directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of window if the network crash all production come to a stop since window be reliant upon the network for it file los of datum usually occur a well since user work in window at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work although minimal disk space be still a consideration if the user file be maintain on the network a large number of user can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal window file alone user can not easily move from machine to machine unles the workstation hardware be similar thi be due to the window installation be tie to a particular username in the case of network user file the discussion i would like to know from other administrator with a large window userbase how they prefer set up window personally i have setup numerou installation use the shared setup all window and application file be on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disk in fact i sell a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disk for their workstation and thu save that much more money i would also like to see recommendation for application should app such a word excel be instal locally regardles of how window be instal again i keep all file on the network for easy backup and administration but thi be put all egg in one basket if the network crash work come to a halt now i be sure microsoft and i know ymy out there ha their own idea about thi and their insight would be of great value but i hope to hear from person with actual work experience with user and network administration
