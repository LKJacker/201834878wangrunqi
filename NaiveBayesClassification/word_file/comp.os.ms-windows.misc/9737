from cgordon gordon hlavenka subject re save my hard disk allocation error cross-link brad banko write while run the m quick c compiler in a do window under window thi even i get a program ha violate system integrity close all application exit window and restart ymy computer error gawd i love window is there an easy way to restore everything to work order what might be some better approach you probably want to delete any damage executable and reload them fresh datum file should be examine and repair what might have cause thi do the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable i suspiciou of hard drive cach especially when they cache datum write you not stupid smartdrive cach thing and window also run a swap file which may contain datum also all of thi be pretty risky stuff in a pc environment the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to fix the disk and then it look like i would probably have to reinstall window and a few other thing a reasonably accurate prediction here a brief description of how do store file there be three piece to a file the directory entry the fat chain and the datum area you can think of these a a sheet of line notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of card the directory entry notebook paper hold the file name actual size and first cluster number it also hold some other information that not important right now the file allocation table fat chain graph paper tell where to find the actual datum each square of graph paper hold a number if the number be zero the cluster associate with thi box be available if it hold a magic number it be either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk any other number tell which cluster contain the next section of the file the datum area card be where the actual information be store the datum area be organize a cluster of a fix size storage be doled out in chunk of one cluster each in ymy case one cluster be byte a a cluster be fill another be allocate to read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the start cluster number now you read the datum from that cluster next look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read thi will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file naturally these number be usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backward continue read one cluster at a time a you walk thi chain through the fat until you hit the marker which say it the last cluster in the file chkdsk be the do utility that check the sanity and coherence of the directory and the fat and can bludgeon most flaw into submission it do have any intelligence so you have to double-check anything it fix now let do a bite of a post-mortem c c c c c c c allocation error size adjust all of these file have size accord to the fat which do match the size report in their directory entry chkdsk f will alter the directory entry to match the fat size in other word the directory entry for may say the file be byte long but chkdsk find a fat chain of cluster attach to it my number obviously be make up lose allocation unit find in chain byte disk space would be free disk space wa find which be allocate in the fat but be not attach to any directory entry chkdsk f gife you the option of convert these lose chain to file you can then examine the file through and rename or discard them or if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to file then those cluster will simply be mark available in the fat c is cro link on allocation unit c is cro link on allocation unit these file be both reference the same datum cluster obviously one of them at least must be wrong it interest to note that c be ymy window swap file to fix thi you should copy each cross-link file to a new name thi will fix the cross-link by give the file unique datum space now delete the cross-link file examine the copy and try to assemble them properly good luck hint missing piece be likely to be find in those lose chain at the top byte total disk space byte in hide file byte in directory byte in user file byte available on disk ymy disk be pretty close to full thi may be the actual cause of the problem perhap window need to expand it swapfile by an amount which exceed available disk space in any case the short summary be that something trash ymy fat there be utility that can mirror ymy fat and help repair damage after something like thi but you have to run them before the problem occur sorry gordon s hlavenka cgordon vote straight ticket procrastination party dec gordon s hlavenka cgordon vote straight ticket procrastination party dec
