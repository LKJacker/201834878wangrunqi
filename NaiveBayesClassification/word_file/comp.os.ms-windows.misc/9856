from leebr lee brian subject re wp-pcf linux risc in article angcl claude anger write in article leebr lee brian write in article eugene write in article ghhwang ghhwang write dear friend the risc mean reduce instruction set computer the risc usually ha small instruction set so a to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some book about computer architecture for more information about risc hmm not that i be an authority on risc but i clearly remember read that the instruction set on risc cpu be rather large the difference be in address mode risc instruction set be not a orthogonal be cisc theoretically suppose to be reduce not any longer that why everyone be argue about risc cisc personally i think cisc will win out just take a look at the pentium not that i like intel architecture either but that another story bye do you mean that the pentium be better than a risc or that it will outsell them all if the first you have to remember that intel cisc like the pentium be a alway a generation away from the best risc also risc cpu be more costly because they be not sell in the same quantity not even on the same order but i remember read about year maybe about a from hypercube that do a mip wa superscallar and reorder it instruction itself so i not sure but i think the wa a transputer so ya tie a gazillion of them together to get the newest be the which kick anyone butt have see them use much though anyway to respond i think the pentium cisc be better than the more advance risc like the alpha etc the pentium ha approximately the same performance a the superduper alpha here performance be the weird that everyone refer to thi be what i hear the alpha still kick in the butt in fp again thi be what i hear and in the compute world if you sell lot of chip like intel and make it faster like intel you be the winner like intel even though you have a sucky architecture from over year ago like intel if you can make a cisc chip superscalar superduperpipelined superfast with the idea behind the risc ideology you get a cisc chip and then i admit i ca see the advantage of risc over cisc if the latest technology be a generation behind then it suck relatively speak now i may sound like i like intel but i have to say that the be some real kick butt pile of si and but i hope that motorola really catch up with the line or i gon na start cry brian brian hojo lee hey excuse me mi could i have a gif of you leebr leebr try linux the best and free clone
