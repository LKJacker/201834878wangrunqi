from baseball gregg walter subject mathcad swap file reposting and summarize for ymy information or additional comment thi is long i have of memory on my mhz an intel math coprocessor and a hard drive with free no compression i have be run mathcad under window in enhance mode with a ram drive smart drive and no swap file permanent or temporary for several month i be interest in the faster mathcad but i be concern about report swap file requirement and the legitimacy of mathsoft claim about increase speed to user will mathcad run without a swap file or insist that i use a swap file so far in response to a le detail description of my setup or in unrelated post the more inform answer on the net or by e-mail appear to be by fues david a fues according to mathsoft no mathcad use the swap file extensively so a not to overburden the physical resource they say thi be actually a feature a figure of wa indicate to me a a minimum but you might try anyway by bert tyler i not all that certain that mathcad be the culprit here i have a with of main memory le for a ramdisk and a bite for a do session that be open a part of the startup proces which i have be run without any swapfile when i instal the subsystem from the march betum of the nt sdk the subsystem itself demand the presence of a swapfile the only program i run to date be the version of freecell that come with that subsystem i give window a small temporary swapfile i leery of file that must remain in fix location on my hard disk and all seem well by bca brian c anderson what be i upgrade to mathcad and it instal a directory for under during the upgrade it tell me that wa require by steven v mathcad make use of the library you probably hear about it be a window library that provide much of the window nt functionality no support for thread and multitasking and such but can be run under window by rhynetc thoma c rhyne i also have mb of ram and indeed mathcad insist on a permanent swapfile it would not run otherwise by bishop greg bishop mathcad absolutely require ram with swap file or ram with swap file it will give you a not enough memory error if the swap file be le than it be a major resource hog if you do not load the symbolic processor or the smart math it take about of ram real or virtual just to load again due to the library so it seem that in addition to the system requirement show on mathsoft advertisement for that you need a swap file possibly a big a look like i would just need an swap file and would need to choose or can i between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file apparently a subsystem ship with mathcad how much disk space do thi require i also receive these answer by mfdjh dale hample if you get meg of ram why not configure a a ram disk for mathcad do permit different bootup configuration can mathcad be configure to use such a ram drive instead of a swap file if not i do see how use do for an alternate bootup would provide window with thi swap file some time back i remember a discussion about the issue of use a ram drive to support a swap file but i think thi involve slower system i have do but for variou reason have not yet do a full installation by the way be a full installation of do require to avail oneself of the alternate bootup feature which file from the installation disk be require by wild wildstrom presumeably you mean without a permanent swap file if window need a swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one do exist permanent be generally faster though i do know why mathcad would be happy with either type ver be and so should any program conform to the win specification so far ha be enough ram to avoid the overhead of run any swap file i have be run mathcad under window without one
