from wkwinkel subject re color or monochrome walther i have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flicker i only suggest use the color screen if it do without flicker if thi be not too small for ymy taste at a personally i prefer the mono-screen a i alway have quite a few window open if you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color be worth trade in the smaller size if you want to develop program you will alway have to check the color i use a mono screen worst of both world and wa surprise how the color look i choose on a color screen regard olaf winkelhake
