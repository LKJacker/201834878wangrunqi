from ralph ralph brendler subject re using microsoft foundation class with borland c in article fcp make m kerkhoff write hi all ha anybody try to compile ctrltest from the directory after compile the mfc-lib with bwc seem to me that bwc be able to distinguish pointer to overload function for example imagine the follow overload function void void void int after try the whole day i think with bwc it impossible to take the adres of one of the above two function and assign it to a properly define function pointer am i right ha anybody else have thi problem thanx i think you may be chase the wrong problem i do think it be the function overload at all i do that sort of thing all of the time in bc without a hitch the big problem i have encounter in port mfc to bc be that fact that mfc depend on a couple of invalid c assumption i have never get the entire ctrltest app to run under bc but the reason be that m make some bad assumption about the order in which object be initialize some object be get access before they be initialize the problem be in the owner-draw menu code somewhere if you comment out that section all other piece of ctrltest work fine two other major gotcha i have find use mfc under bc the cfile openflag enum use hard-coded number for the open mode rather than the manifest constant define in which differ between msc and bc all of the mfc collection class depend on another bad c assumption that a reference to a base object can use be in place of a reference to a derive object true for pointer not for reference i be sure there be other problem along the same line but i have not encounter them yet i have not see mfc yet but i hope that some of these will be address if they be not all of m hype about portability to other vendor compiler will be just that if these be my employer opinion i would be post them whoever say nothing last forever wa obviously r brendler not a cub fan mike royko sps inc chicago il
