from oecjtb john bongiovanni subject summary database c library well i amaze at how successful thi exercise wa i receive response and request for summary thank to everyone who make it possible on my own i wa able to find out about codebase accsy and codebase and accsy be c library without sql be a window application that can be communicate through window dde call where you send a sql string and receive the result most person write to tell me about the paradox engine from borland other product mention be microsoft odbc accsy quadbase codebase rbase and only odbc quadbase rbase and have sql for myself i decide on codebase mostly because it ha an ansi c portability version that run under do unix etc and include the source code and portability be important in my application it work with dbase foxpro or clipper file however i feel that microsoft odbc look very promise it mostly a formalisation of build and submit sql query and format query result a the response say it available vium ftp except it effectively unusuable without two manual the odbc programmer reference and the odbc sdk guide moreover odbc do actually interpret sql and liase with databasis that up to driver that should be provide by database manufacturer also it window only it actually an extension to the window sdk nevertheles it a start at a sql interface standard and should make life interest in the future here my original post follow by the response separate by a line of asterisk do anyone know if borland or microsoft have library for access their respective databasis paradox foxpro from within c program i really like to be able to build a sql query string and pa it to a function which return the query result in some format failing that any other acces would still be better than nothing i also like to hear of third party library for do the same thing if other person be interest i prepare a summary of what i tell and post it thank to all borland ha a product call paradox engine that do just what you want the current version be which be fully compatible with ack paradox why the version be different i do know pd engine wa compatible with pdox and it consist of a rather broad library of function for accesing database file from both pascal i think turbo pascal and up and c i think either microsoft or borland now read the box it borland paradox engine database framework work with any borland mocrosoft c or later turbo c for window turbo pascal or later tp for window or later for framework application bc or later or m it do have support for object useage i have have a real chance to really use it myself but it look fairly complete i plan to use it thi summer rick rick osterberg osterber harvard yard mail center cambridge ma usa borland ha a product which be call paradox engine i do not know about m the paradox engine i know very well and it definitiely not a replacement for sql but it will enable you to save and restore record ha lock et al supposedly the paradox for window wa impemented on top of it charle parker phone technical support centerline software inc fax cparker cyberspace momma do let yer child grow up to be cowboy i know borland ha a library of routine for access paradox from within a c program they recently come out with version thi work with both borland and microsoft c compiler shailesh bhobe att psp m ha put their odbc sdk into the public domain it big i believe mb but worth download over a fast link look at in also some company be start to provide sql engine i just get one for rbase not exactly cheap at but it allow program in c or vbasic under do or window to talk to datum basis use sql function in ymy code hth walter knopf fermilab knopf check out the odbc toolikt from microsoft it be available on thi be the way that we choose to acces databasis from all of my app mj ppppp sssssiiiiius specialist in ms-window and windows-nt development pp pps ius call for information about my tool ooaid ppppp sss ius michaeljon miller mikem pp ss ius proficient solution inc pp ssss iiiiius holme ave so minneapoli mn borland sell the paradox engine which be a c language interface to paradox dbase btrieve an ascus file they also sell database framework which include the engine plu a collection with source of c class for use the engine earl roethke eroethke i actualy have paradox engine it be a library of function large model for access the paradox databasis it seem to be work fine but i never do try it thouroughly it cost hope it will help you from david lefebvre david borland provide a database lib call paradox engine which can acces and use the database file aswell a many other thing gary bell gary bell department of robotic and digital technology faculty of computing caulfield campu monash university australium paradox engine be the library for paradox artur babecki artur borland sell the paradox engine which ha all the paradox call in it it hardly sql though you can do search on key field and on indivual field but no comparison operator like so it pretty painful in my opinion do do anything beside simple retrieval and i currently use it i have an eval copy and i link it in to some entry screen i write the engine library add about to the size of the program but you can load it a an overlay use borland vroom manager now borland claim that later version of the engine will have sql support but they do really expect it till late in the year or even next year they be try to get thrid party to help out if you have any other question let me know mike kamlet mike ye borland sell their paradox engine separately it ha c c and pascal interface although the underlie interface be in well at least for version of the engine which i have cost at egghead they now have version of the engine and a separate c clas package for it michael d kersenbrock adc kentrox portland oregon michaelk uunet kentrox michaelk i use accsy for paradox new version be almost ready for paradox to acces paradox file from c it pretty good not sql though have hear of borland paradox engine or some such which be suppose to do likewise but not sure of what it be exactly hope thi help good luck chri from fernand christopher fernande borland sell their paradox engine it a library of function for access paradox db file it come with library for m c bcc turbo pascal v and i believe it come with turbo library a well the c library come in both do and window flavor the win stuff be dll when i get it it also come with crystal report which be a graphical report generator it allow you to create a generic form and use it within a compile program use pdox engine i do know if they still offer it or what the current price be i pay something like for an upgrade from the earlier version though hope thi help david taylor the commander it be easier to change the internet specification to fit the program also dtaylor than vice-versa and root author unknown but very wise if you want to do sql from within ymy program check out quadbase i do have their addres oop ye i do quadbase system inc lucerne dr sunnyvale ca usa phone voice fax ask for the demo disk it look good to me i have a background in embed sql in ingre thi look real similar it a little expensive but if you order the demo and then just wait they will probably send you a special offer that probably run about u good luck best tom delosh from delosh tom delosh borland ha the paradox engine library it ha library for both c and pascal to acces paradox file under but for paradox i believe you have buy have the sql link since pdox itself be sql compliant i use the engine for over a year now and have be pretty satisfy with it under do it a real pig it tack on about to the size of ymy program tim ma associate programmer university of utah email tim i do know about microsoft but borland sell the paradox engine for pascal in one package and if you want dbase compatible file there be a library call codebase from sequiter software that work with from davidr david j ray we use database library to do what you describe it a set of dll access through a common apus to talk to most of the major database format we use it to build an application that query several databasis use sql query all acces use be do use sql the package be available through microway in melbourne i believe it be produce by pioneer system in the u we have no association with microway or pioneer system other than be satisfy customer feel free to mail me for further information chri programming for nsw national park and wildlife service chri hutchinson box research programmer university of new england chri armidale nsw paradox engine provide a complete set of c library for access paradox table however it seem that it support only c and microsoft c when i try to compile the engine sample application with the waterloo watcom compiler it complain that the library file be miss even though i be quite certain that the file be not part of watcom c or the engine anybody have any succes with other c compiler i currently develop an app with borland paradox engine for c it also come in pascal which ha recently go to version px engine be compatible with paradox and downward compat there be indeed c lib for fox acces but i ca think of the name offhand i sure someone ha already write you in that regard i think i just saw an add for a fox lib in the c user journal which be a good place to look for thi type of package in general by the way i be pay my due to learn a lot of the quirk of px eng over the past year would recommend it for a complex multiuser app but i stay with it for now it like a bad marriage i get too much time invest in learn and work-around but if ymy interest be limit to a simple single-user interface you want to build ymy own sql engine i take it px engine will do the job easily it do sound like you be bump into any of the gotcha if you do write me i may be able to point you in the right direction from raymond raymond borland ha a paradox engine and database framework which gife you a c and assembler apus to paradox databasis thi be part of boca borland object component architecture they have technical brief on boca pdoxeng and other product of their from
