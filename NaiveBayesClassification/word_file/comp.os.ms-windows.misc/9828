from jamie jamie scuglium subject workspace manager for win a small review thank to all those person who recommend workspace manager for window i find shareware workspace manager from australium ms-window archive which mirror some site in the the three i find be workspace thi wa the smallest and simplest of the workspace manager that i find it be very easy to use it display a small window contain button plu an extra button for configuration purpose one annoy feature wa the title window that be first present when it be run you must pres a key not a mouse button for the thing to go away also it would have be nice if there wa an alway on top set for the little window contain the workspace button maybe some user-specified string on the button instead of the number one to six might be a nice feature the simplicity and ease of use of thi workspace manager make it an attractive package workshift while thi workspace manager offer a few feature that workspace lack it wa quite time consume to set thing up with workspace all but the first workspace be initially empty with workshift you need to take snapshot of how you want each of ymy workspace to look like what application they contain also the main window be quite large but thi do allow you to have a small view of what be in each workspace with workspace there wa no facility for view what wa in a workspace without switch to it workshift provide thi view functionality which be quite useful bigdesk and backmenu thi be an interest package which contain a few other goody a well a a workspace manager other goody include backmenu which provide a pop-up root menu when you pres a certain mouse button just like in x-window the menu be totally configurable offer unlimited depth of cascade menu which be provide quite handy acces to application you could say it be a menu-based alternative to the program manager also bundle in be a program call wrun which allow you to run window application from a do shell under window instead of use the file manager to run application the actual workspace manager be call bigdesk bigdesk work quite differently to the other two workspace manager in that it do provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspace in fact it basically enlarge ymy desktop by a configurable amount and you choose which region of the desktop you want ymy screen to focu in on thi mean you can have window overlap between different view region unlike the first two workspace manager in which each workspace wa isolate from the other one the bigdesk control window allow to to move window around ymy enlarge desktop basically the control window provide a small scale view of ymy view area while ymy actual computer screen provide a large scale or blow-up of a particular section try each of them out for yourself i wa impress with all of them so find out which one suit ymy need the best
