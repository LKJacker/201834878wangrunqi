from jame dean barwick subject re permanaent swap file with do dbldisk in you write while read through the do book it state that the window permanaent swap file will not work correctly when place on a compress drive to make thing compatable i remove my permanent swap file before start the upgrade however when all the dust settle and i go into window it say that the temporary swap file be right where it alway wa in the window directory my question be how come the temporary swap file work ok with a compress drive and the permanent one do you might want to look in window faq for thi one but here be my best explanation but i ca guarantee that i not way off base the permenant swap file be to by window by talk directly to the hard disk controller card the controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that window create a file call in ymy window directory that point to that file it then use the physical information about ymy disk to index to information in that file compress disk be actually logical disk these disk have different characteristic than the actual physical disk furthermore the information on the compress disk must be uncompress before it be use it must go through the decompression program that trap disk read at the operate system level or the bio level because of thi inbetween program window can not use direct method to read from the logical disk a permenant swap file be only there to reserve an area of the disk that window can use and to block that space from do window would theoretically not even have to acces the file from do to use that disk space i do know if it do or do but it check for it somewhere everytime you boot window a temporary swap file be just a normal do file that be access by window vium do and the bio if a disk compression program or other tsr be load the file acces must go through do tsr disk compression and bio in order to be acces never use a temporary swap file never more on permenent swap file i sure everyone who ha an uncompress part of their compress hard disk ha see the message you have select a swap file greater than the suggest size window will only use the size suggest do you wa to create thi swap file anyway or something like that well a friend of mine robert call microsoft and ask them what and why what they say be that window check the amount of free disk space and divide that number by then it check for the largest contiguou block of free disk space window then suggest the smaller of the two number they also say that under absolutely no circumstance none will window use a swap file larger than the suggest size well that what he say i call bull if thi be true why do window report the memory be available to me if it not go to use it any taker jame if thi do get to the net will someone post it for me thank
