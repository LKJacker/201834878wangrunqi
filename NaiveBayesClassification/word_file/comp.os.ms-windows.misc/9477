from bharper brett harper subject gui application framework for window hello i investigate the purchase of an object oriented application framework i have come acros a few that look good zapp from inmark zinc from zinc software from liant win from blaise some consideration i use being new to window program i from the world the quality and intuitivnes of the abstraction that these clas library provide be very important however since i not adverse to learn the internal of window program the new program methodology should be closely align with the native one i do believe arbitrary level of abstraction just for the sake of change the apus be valuable since we will be develop for the window nt system the memory management issue and issue particular to the window apus be le important we will probably buy another c clas library something like or booch component from rational to handle datum structure and other miscellaneou stuff allocator etc so those feature be not that important for thi toolkit to have the two that i have narrow it down to be zapp and zinc they seem to be the two toolkit that have receive the most attention from the medium i wa wonder if anyone have any first-hand experience with any of these toolkit especially zapp and zinc a couple of observation about these toolkit that seem particularly noteworthy be zapp seem to have the most extensive coverage of window functionality and also include some other miscellaneou useful class ha new fancy control available and support for custom control ha a window nt version essential redirectable graphic architecture useful for print sizer clas for automatically manage control layout after resize seem to be the newcomer thi could be an advantage in design a better system zinc ha a platform independent resource strategy not too important for me right now come with a interface builder tool ha a window nt version essential seem to have be around longer more mature but grow up out of a do version had a better demo both have source code availability option both be lack ole support neither seem to have any particular support for multimedium type stuff any think anyone ha on thi would be much appreciate thank brett harper
