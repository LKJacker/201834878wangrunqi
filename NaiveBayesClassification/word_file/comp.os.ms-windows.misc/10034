from kayman robert kayman subject summary canon v hp deskjet hello again about a week and one-half ago i post a query look for person feel on the inkjet family of printer specifically a comparison between the canon bubblejet and the hewlett-packard deskjet many person ask me to post the of all the post and e-mail i receive below be my original query and the response i receive i have not delete any part of the response only the header and signature so you can extract what you find necessary some person ask me for an unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggest favoritism and bias comment you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer there be a wide range of comment each ha it own value there wa no clear winner some like the especially it ratio other prefer the durability and reliability of the deskjet the original inkjet with prove driver and a solid background two new inkjet printer have draw some attention a new printer to be introduce by hewlett-packard later thi year around summertime and an addition to the epson product line their first inkjet you will find that after the initial purchase the cost of re-filling or replace the ink cartridge be about the same thi largely depend on where you purchase the re-fill or replacement so shop around first since thi aspect will most likely dominate the cost of ymy printer no one mention approx how many sheet each ink cartridge will print but i suspect they be roughly equal at about sheet laser printer will do sheet per toner cartridge well that a brief research summary of my personal research enjoy hello fellow i be ask for ymy collect wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bubblejet v the hp deskjet i think rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from rely on those who use these printer daily and use them to their fullest potential and i figure all of you will know their benefit and pitfall better than any salesperson now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpus of the canon bubblejet v the hewlett-packard deskjet dpus which be faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphic which will handle large document better page or more any personal experience on either will be appreciate here which work better under window any driver problem etc cost of memory font package toner cartridge etc basically ymy personal experience with either of these machine be highly desirable both good and bad well i buy the bj about a month ago at the start of their rebate program on that printer it end and i buy it from computer discount warehouse because their price of could be beat anywhere i look and i think it a hot printer just use regular copier paper produce fantastic result just in high quality mode i compare the output of a micrografx designer legal size draw with type do on my bj with the same draw print on an hp laserjet iid and i wa amaze how well i could read the small print on the bj printing speed wa several second faster on the bj which be amaze consider that the hp ha ram instal i measure the time from when the printer first indicate it wa receive datum a i use print manager in window i show the output to several person at work and one manager buy one immediately for hi office and two other engineer place their order too if you need cdw phone number it delivery to ny wa two day good luck craig witkowski motorola communication electronic inc glen rock nj i own a deskjet performance be spectacular under window use truetype font but neither be the canon from what i have see quality for the hp be very much dependent on paper quality on photo-copy paper the character have slightly edge but on better quality type paper thing look better for most application i find copy paper fine still better than dot-matrix come with a window driver which seem to by-pas print manager ha a few be hp scaleable font probably faster than truetype but have really try them out can get ram font cartridge but unles the speed of truetype be a problem i would bother the ram cartridge ca be use a buffer soft font only for graphic bmp image etc the hp can be put into a dither mode vium the hp supply win driver there a number of dither option such a etc the manual gife recommendation depend on the type of image be print text be not so good in thi mode problem arise when you have a document which contain both graphic and text the range of tone for graphic image be brilliant but i think that be more of a limitation with inkjet printer in general from what i have see the canon be similar in most respect however a printer definitely worth look at be the new inkjet from epson thi printer be faster cheaper and capable of produce laser-like quality on normal copier paper ca remember the model lx something i think i purchase my hp day before the epson wa release here the introductory price on the epson wa the same a the hp here in new zealand about a month ago i get a canon i absolutely love it it be incredibly fast except for print from pspice i do know if you ever do stuff with that or not most of the stuff i print be either from microsoft word for window or just plain text the only problem i have be print the printer freak out and print on cheap paper lot of streak normal copy paper work great with it you can only tell it not laser-printed by hold it oh le than twelve inch from ymy face that be if you nearsighted like me the printer come with it own driver for window i have no other complaint the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software package that have write a driver for it yet the teeny-weeny footprint be a real plu too and if you purchase it between now and may you get a rebate from canon i buy mine from a store call compusa and the price now be i have a friend who ha the hp you be look at it also print very well and everyone ha driver for it but it be very slow hope i help sure look great heather stehman in article craig witkowski write in message kayman robert kayman write hello fellow i be ask for ymy collect wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bubblejet v the hp deskjet i think rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from rely on those who use these printer daily and use them to their fullest potential and i figure all of you will know their benefit and pitfall better than any salesperson variou question delete well i buy the bj about a month ago at the start of their rebate program on that printer it end and i buy it from computer discount warehouse because their price of could be beat anywhere i look and i think it a hot printer just use regular copier paper produce fantastic result just in high quality mode i compare the output of a micrografx designer legal size draw with type do on my bj with the same draw print on an hp laserjet iid and i wa amaze how well i could read the small print on the bj printing speed wa several second faster on the bj which be amaze consider that the hp ha ram instal i measure the time from when the printer first indicate it wa receive datum a i use print manager in window i gues i have some experience with both i have a at work and a deskjet at home i prefer the deskjet the print speed and quality be similar i test both with text and graphic before buy the deskjet for home the feature that set the deskjet apart be the driver support in so many application the bj end up emulate the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with many non-window app and thi will be the case for a long time the design be superior if you just want to use cut paper the deskjet be quieter and the ink cartridge be quite a bite cheaper due to the number of deskjet out there in comparision to the bj just my worth mike mattix agricultural group of monsanto box luling la internet addres dmmatt ye there be the landscape mode print problem but it do not present a problem in window a the window printer driver handle the translation i actually think of some other point after i post the note the deskjet ha an unprintable area of approximately around the paper the bubblejet do not you be right about the graphic resolution i test the printer with the application i have acces to wordperfect harvard graphic wingif paintshop pro and paintbrush and could not tell a difference in fact one of the hp deskjet window driver gife you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence control the amount of ink you put down the bubblejet do not i have no image software to test the printer with and so have no comparision there finally i want sheet feed in that configuration the bubblejet cost approximately more than the deskjet i go through a pretty thorough evaluation and choose the deskjet when i spend my own money btw i be replace the with a deskjet at work thi month anyway regard mike mattix ag group of monsanto luling la i spend some time compare the two we end up get the bubblejet versu the hp my reason be the hp seem to have worse band than the canon versu we felt we could see the difference price canon ha a rebate program go on at the moment the wa my choice over the we could have page in the feeder the hold only page i think a you can see up to page on the we have do anything big with the bj but it performance seem reasonable under window i know that the microsoft bb ha a newer window driver than come with the printer but i do know how it compare also the driver include with the printer be canon wherea i do know where the microsoft bb one come from microsoft hope thi help thoma v frauenhofer tvf uunet uupsi tvf tvf mandlebratwurst the meal that eat itself altough i sometime also a salesperson if i not suppost to study i would recommend to buy the the print quality be a bite better but you you get much more possiblity do forget the hp engine be at least year on the mark the canon engine witch be also use in other new bubblejet printer like the epson one be quite recently available now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpus of the canon bubblejet v the hewlett-packard deskjet dpus which be faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphic which will handle large document better i see during a short demonstration from someone who try to sell me canon printer time the same picture one print with the one with the canon the other with the hp and there wa a difference in print quality the canon wa a bite better greetz kri when we decide we need quiet printer in my hospital we look to inkjet printer they have near laser quality speed and they be quiet we use both hp deskjet and the canon i prefer the paper handle quality of the deskjet but i feel the canon have superior print quality the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder however i do end up buy a deskjet for home use get too good a deal anyway we be use canon in high volume area and they be hold up very well out of deskjet and i have only have one problem with a deskjet and that wa take care of very quickly by hp nate whenever i buy anything i look at what the expert say pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criterium be the most apt i be unusually flush lately no beg letter please and so i do thi a few time include about fmy month ago with inkjet printer i ca remember much about the proces except that i read about three review of inkjet and that the wa alway at or near the top i buy the because of the add dimension of colmy i intend to build a multus medium machine at some stage and have just buy a colmy scanner toward that although i haven use the colmy thing in earnest yet i try it out on a couple of window bitmap and i wa please with the result i note that even though you can now get the the one with both colmy and mono with no need to change the cartridge the and be still readily available at least in the uk the follow be my i do know anything about the canon except that i come away from review and reply to a post similar to your with the idea that the hp offer the best ratio i believe hp be the original in the field not alway the ideal place to be but the market still young so one assume they have the expertise the be worth the extra operation in mono be perfectly acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of font from window i use to work for monotype when they still manufacture typesetter before their american owner close them down and i can tell you that in term of definition dpus be pretty poor anyway so dpus be just a bite le poor the hp come with a reasonable set of driver if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack it pretty slow with it god know what it like without i actually work in germany and my pc be home in the uk so it not in daily use i would say that apart from my not read the manual properly and have a really dumb problem at the start it easy peasy to operate hope thi be of use regard david just buy the i think the price could be beat with rebate thru and so far it be comparable even superior to the deskjet in print quality speed per page rate seem to be faster i do have figure i do print long doc though quality i think the graphic quality be excellent print quality be excellent a well unles you use small font and hold it up close you can see a lot more jaggy than on a laserjet the dpus be offset by a little le accuracy in hold the head in place i would imagine large doc not room in the standard model for a whole lottum page manual say up to though have try it driver no problem under yet winword do want to print the envelope the same way the canon do though know nothing of add-on cost daniel a hartung dhartung ask me about rotaract the deskjet be slow thi be in comparison to the other printer i mention i have no idea how the bubblejet compare the interface between and the printer be just dandy i not have any problem with it i just buy a printer a couple of day ago i compare it to the sample print of an hp deskjet and know that the hp wa for me the be pretty fast and really print with good quality i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical depend on the kind of paper i do have problem with the ink not be dry it seem to dry very fast probably within a second since canon be give a rebate until the end of may it be really a good buy sean eckton computer support representative college of fine art and communication wow it funny you should ask thi i a little behind in news read so i know thi may be late i just purchase the canon bubblejet last night i wa really worry that i would like it but the print quality and noise level be fantastic i print quite a few document with lot of graphic and it print damn near laser quality you ca tell it not laser unles you get inch from the page no problem with driver the printer come with the driver diskette which be good because i wa begin to panic when i could findi it under window or wordperfect it work well under both i have yet to install word for window so do know how it work with them i have a deskjet at work last year it wa a good printer a well ut i felt it wa awfully slow and much noisier than the bubblejet i wo say the bubblejet be much better but i really do like it more just my worth brett sincerely robert kayman kayman or cpa in theory theory and practice be the same in practice they be not you mean you want the revise revision of the original revise revision revise
