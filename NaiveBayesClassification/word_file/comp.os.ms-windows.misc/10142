from mccall fred j mccall subject re question on eisa video board performance in charlea charle allen write from article by cfw christopher f wroten i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video card only match the performance of their isa counterpart for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iis-e be only about a fast a the isa diamond speedstar plu which be what i would call fast i do understand why eisa video card be a a group on the same level of performance a local bu card give that eisa video card have a bite bu to move datum around instead of isa bite good question answer the eisa bu do move bite rather than isa but it still move it at about the speed a the isa bu i think that either or mhz the local bu design also move bite like the eisa but they move the datum at the cpu speed up to mhz so on a cpu the local bu be move datum at mhz and the eisa be move datum at or mhz so the local bu should be to time faster than eisa on a mhz cpu eisa should be about two maybe time a fast a isa i would expect the eisa board to be more than twice a fast a the isa board not only be you move datum on a path twice a wide at least but there be a difference in the number of clock require for bu transaction between the two bus most isa board require multiple clock per bu transaction typically thi be around eisa board be suppose to be able to at a rate so i would expect performance to be that of an isa card so i gues for me the question be unanswered still i would expect him to be able to see a speed difference and he apparently do not insisting on perfect safety be for person who do have the ball to live in the real world mary shafer nasa ame dryden i do speak for other and they do speak for me
