from banschbach subject re robert biological alchemy robert i so glad that you post ymy biological alchemy discussion i be compare to the famou robert mcelwaine by some reader of scus med i do know how to respond since i have not see one of ymy post just like i have read the yeast connection let me just start by state that the author of the cold fusion paper of recent year be now in scientific exile i believe that one ha actually leave the country scientific fraud be rare i still not sure that if a review of the research note of the cold fusion scientist actually prove fraud or just very shoddy experimentation ymy source do not seem to be research article they be more like lay text design to pique human interest in a subject area just like the food combine and life extension text robert i try to keep an open mind but some thing i just ca buy one be take sod orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body ymy experiment if conduct by reader of thi news group would prove that you be right more ash after seed sprout than before unles you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature above degree i believe you will get organic residue in the ash even the residue in commercial incinerator contain organic residue i remember do thi kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but i could find a temperature for mineral ash formation so i really guess at degree f it may actually be much higher the point be that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce only a mineral ash they also could not measure the mineral so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct chemical reaction abound in my body in my atmosphere in my water and in my soil are these fusion reaction ye many of them do involve fuse oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organic and inorganic do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon be fuse with silicon not in my book robert silicon be the most abundant mineral on my planet i see speculation that man could have evolve to be a silicon base rather than a carbon base life-form i like read science fiction a many person do but i know enough about biochemistry and nutrition to be able in most case to separate the fiction from the fact silicon may be one of the trace element that turn out to be essential in human we have several gram of the stuff in my body what it do there only the lord know right now but i will tell you what i do know about silicon and why a you state it help bone heal and it be not because silicon be transform into calcium almost all of the silicon in the human body be find in the connective tissue collagen and elastin there have be study publish which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosi the higher the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin be to a an age-related los of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that be often see a part of the age proces in human for bone fracture heal the first step be a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate be pump by osteoblast a high level of silicon in the diet seem to speed up thi matrix formation thi first step in the bone heal proces seem to be the hardest for some person to get go electriacl current have be use in an attempt to get the matrix form cell orient in the right direction so that the matrix can be form in the gap or gap between the end of the break bone a vitamin c deficiency by slow collagen formation a well a cause the prodcution of defective collagen do slow down both bone and wind heal zinc be also another big player in bone and wind heal and so be silicon in an undetermined role that most likely invole matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium for you to take thi bone heal observation and use it a proof that silicon be transform into calcium be an interest little trick but robert i have the same problem myself when i read the lay pres and ye even some scientific paper is the explanation reasonable without a very good science knowledge base you and most reader of thi news group be fly blind you have to take it on faith because you do know any better if the explanation seem to make sense to me base on my knowledge base i incline to consider it thi usually mean try to find other source that come to the same conclusion if the idea like a candida bloom seem to make sense to me i tend to pursue it a long a any advice that i go to give be go to really me somebody up if thi make u kindred soul robert then i gues i have to live with that label for the physician who have decide to read my response to robert interest post i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on tv i ca remember the network or hi name like many night i wa on my computer and my wife wa watch tv in my den where i have my computer setup thi neurosurgeon take kid with brain tumor that everyone else ha give up on and he use unconventional treatment hi own word he say that he ha a succes rate the one case that i hear him discuss would normally use radiation conventional treatment he wa go to go in and cut you guy complain about the cost of the anti-fungal what do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery be guy i go to ask you guy one more time why blast a physician who take the chronic sinu sufferer like jon and the chronic gi sufferer like elaine and try to help them use unconventional treatment treatment which do not result in death like those that the neurosurgeon use is it because candida bloom be not life-threatening while brain tumor be how about quality of life guy may the candida demon never cro ymy sinu cavity or gut if it do you may feel differently about the issue marty b
