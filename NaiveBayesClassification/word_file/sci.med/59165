from banschbach subject candida yeast bloom fact or fiction i can not believe the way thi thread on candida yeast ha progress steve dyer and i have be exchange word over the same topic in scus med nutrition when he display hi typical reserve and attack a woman poster for be treat by a liscenced physician for a disease that do not exist calling thi physician a quack wa reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the other be do it here a well let me tell you who the quack really be these be the physican who have no idea how the human body interact with it environment and how that balance can be alter by diet and antibiotic these be the physician who dismis their patient with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elaine in scus med nutrition and then when they find one that solf their problem the rest start yell quack could it just be professional jealousy i could help elaine or jon but somebody else do could they know more than me no way they must be a quack i be teach a human nutrition course for medical student for over ten year now and gues who the most receptive student be those that be raise on farm and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animal and those student who have make a dramatic diet change prior to enter medical school switch to the vegan diet typically thi be about of my clas of student those not interest in nutrition either tune me out or just stop come to clas that okay because i know that some of what i teach be go to stick and there will be at least a few enlighten physician practice in the it really too bad that most medical school do cover nutrition because if they do candida would not be view a a non-disease by so many in the medical profession in animal husbandry an animal be reinnoculated with good bacterium after antibiotic be stop medicine ha decide that since human do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacterium be need after come off a braod spectrum antibiotic human have all kind of different organism live in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuse vagina and on the skin these be nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in person unles the immune system be compromise they be also call nonpathogen because unlike the pathogenic organism that cause human disease they do not produce toxin a they live out their merry existence in and on my body but any of these organism will be consider pathogenic if it manage to take up residence within the body a poor mucu membrane barrier can let thi happen and vitamin a be mainly responsible for set up thi barrier steve get real upset with elaine doctor because he wa use anti-fungal and vitamin a for her gi problem if steve really understoood what vitamin a do in the body he would not or at least should not be call elaine doctor a quack here be a brief primer on yeast yeast infection a they be commonly call be not truely cause by yeast the most common organism responsible for thi type of infection be candida albican or monilium which be actually a yeast-like fungu an infection cause by thi organism be call candidiasi candidiasi be a very rare occurance because like an e coli infection it require that the host immune system be severly depress candida be frequently find on the skin and all of the mucou membrane of normal healthy person and it rarely become a problem unles some predispose factor be present such a a high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotic ha be use in diabetic their secretion contain much higher amount of glucose candida unlike bacterium be very limit in it food fuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survife if it get acces to a lot of glucose it bloom and over ride the other organism live with it in the sinuse gi tract or vagina in diabetic skin lesion can also foster a good bloom site for these little bugger the bloom be usually just a minor irritant in most person but some person do really develop a bad inflammatory proces at the mucu membrane or skin bloom site whether thi be an allergic like reaction to the candida or not be certain when the bloom be in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy see and some doctor do then try to treat it if it internal only symptom can be use and these symptom be pretty nondiscript candida be keep in check in most person by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuse the gi tract mouth stomach and intestine and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally do not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organism unles they broach the mucu membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most american be not get enough vitamin a from their diet about of all american die with le vitamin a than they be bear with autopsy study while thi low level of vitamin a do not cause pathology blindnes it do impair the mucu membrane barrier system thi would then be a predispose factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetic can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of thi type of bloom be the use of broad spectrum antibiotic which knock down many different kind of bacterium in the body and remove the main competition for candida a far a food be concern while drug be available to handle candida many patient find that their doctor will not use them unles there be evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti-fungal drug do warrant some caution but if the gi or sinu inflammation be suspect to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic be the smoke gun then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just a the anti-fungal cream be an appropriate treatment for recur vaginal yeast infection in spite of what mr steve dyer say but even in patient be give the anti-fungal the irritation cause by the excessive candida bloom in the sinu gi tract or the vagina tend to return after drug treatment be discontinue unles the underlie cause of the problem be address lack of a good bacterial flora in the body poor mucu membrane barrier lactobacillu acidophilu be the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from it name it be an acid love organism and it set up an acidic condition be it grow candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l acidophiliu be the predominate bacterium unles you be hit with broad spectrum antibiotic in the gi system the ano-rectal region seem to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many woman create a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive way to minimmize thi transfer be to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occur in the anal area the burn swell pain and even blood discharge make many patient think that they have hemorroid if the bloom manage to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occur abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool thi positive stool for occult blood be what send elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive test he tell her that there wa nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan ha tell me throiugh e-mail that he consider occult blood test in stool specimen to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positive candida bloom guy if my gut hurt me on a constant basi i would want it fix ye it nice to know that i do have colon cancer but what then be cause my distres when i finally find a doctor who treat me and get me better steve dyer call him a quack candida prefer a slightly alkaline environment while bacterium tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina become alkaline during a woman period and thi be often when candida bloom in the vagina vinegar and water douch be the best way of deal with vaginal problem many woman have also get relief from the introduction of lactobacillu directly into the vaginal tract i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before try thi my wife have thi vagina problem after go on birth control pill and search for over a year until she find a gynocologist who solve the problem rather than just writting script for anti-fungal cream thi wa a woman gynocologist who have have the same problem recur vaginal yeast infection thi do some dig and come up with an acetic acid and l acidophili douche which she use in ymy office to keep it sterile after three treatment sex return to my marraige i have often wonder what an with chronic gi distres or sinu problem would do about the problem that he tell hi patient be a non-existent syndrome the nonpathogenic bacterium l acidophilu be an acid produce bacterium which be the most common bacterium find in the vaginal tract of healthy woman if take orally it can also become a major bacterium in the gut through aresol spray it ha also be use to innoculate the sinu membrane but before thi innoculation occur the mucu membrane barrier system need to be strengthen thi be accomplish by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b-complex vitamin diet survey repeatedly show that american be not get enough and folate these be probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with thi non-existent disorder candida bloom after antibiotic therapy some of the above material wa obtain from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale pres a well a note from my human nutrition course i will be post a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference cite to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a play in the mucu membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in deal with candida bloom another effective dietary treatment be to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase thi be especially important if the gi system be involve if candida can not get glucose it not go to out grow the bacterium and you then give bacterium which can use amino acid and fatty acid for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate be return to the gut if steve and some of the other nay-sayer want to jump all over thi post fine i jump all over steve in scus med nutrition because he verbably accost a poster who wa seek advice about her doctor use of vitamin a and anti-fungal for a candida bloom in her gut person seek advice from newsnet should not be treat thi way those of u give of my time and knowledge can slug it out to my heart content if you save ymy venom for me steve and leave the helples poster who be timidly seek help alone i would have a problem with ymy behavior martin banschbach professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine west st tulsa ok without discourse there be no remember without remember there be no learn without learn there be only ignorance
