from jeffp jeff parke subject re lyme vaccine kathleen richard kilty ucrengr write my year old pomeranian have a nasty reaction to thi vaccination suffice it to say we will not vaccinate her for lyme disease again she be camp through some state and ha backpack with u a well and we be use to watch for tick and deal with them and we simply wo take her to really active lyme disease area not to drag thi out anymore but many veterinarian feel that lyme disease in dog be so easy to treat that in an endemic area they often just give the appropriate antibiotic to dog present with lamenes swell joint fever a recent paper march ha finally establish that lyme disease in dog can be reproduce in a control experimentaly set thi ha be an ellusive matter for researcher and be one of the fundamental requirement for many to acknowledge an agent a be causitive of a particular disease up to now only the vaccine manufacturer ha be able to prove that the disease exist thi paper be noteworthy in two other regard none of the animal they infect be treat in any way the dog have episode of lamenes during a week period which occur month after exposure after thi period none show any further clinical sign up to the month observation period of the study so these be prove clinically sick lyme patient show spontaneou recovery without the benefit of drug treatment of course observation longer than month will be necessary to be sure the disease do have the same chronicity that some see in human the addendum to the paper call into question the technique use by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine of course they want the world to use the model they develop in order to test vaccine efficacy anyway maybe we will see some independent scientifically sound evaluation of thi vaccine in the next year or so jeff parke jeffp also jeffp aol jeffparke washington state university college of veterinary medicine clas of pullman wa
