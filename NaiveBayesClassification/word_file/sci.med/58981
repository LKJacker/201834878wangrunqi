from turpin russell turpin subject re science and methodology wa homeopathy tradition i think that part of the problem be that i have propose a definition of science that i intend to be interpret broadly and that lee lady ha interpret fairly narrowly my definition be thi science be the investigation of the empirical that avoid mistake in reason and methodology discover from previou work lee lady write i do think that science should be define in a way that some of the activity that lead to really important science namely think and informal exploration be not recognize a scientific work unles one classify think and informal exploration a a mistake they fall under my definition i hope no one would consider speculation think and informal exploration a unscientific in article lady lee lady write seriously i not sure whether i misjudge you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with ymy insistence that science be mainly about avoid mistake here be where i think we be talk at cross-purpose it be not clear to me that the kind of definition i have propose should be take a describe what science be mainly about consider for example a definition of invertebrate a all animal lack a backbone thi fairly tell what be an invertebrate and what be not an invertebrate but it hardly tell you what invertebrate be all about one can read thi definition and still not know that of all animal specie be invertebrate that invertebrate posse a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate group such a insect and nematode be ubiquitou in all ecosystem etc in short know the definition of invertebrate do not tell one what they be mainly about the misunderstand here be my fault i do not give sufficient context for person to understand my propose definition okay so let see if we agree on thi first of all there be degree of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully control trial before we accept a absolute scientific truth to the extent that there be any such thing the effectivenes of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment be useful secondly it make sense to be more tolerant in my standard of evidence for a pronounce effect than for one that be marginal i agree on both count a an example of the second it would only take a few case of cure rabies to convince most veterinarian that a treatment wa effective despite a lack of control a to the first i do not think it be useful to talk about absolute scientific truth i think it be more useful to talk about the kind of evidence that variou claim have and the kind of evidence in particular field that in the past have prove faulty or reliable the latter be obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioner try to discover the relevance of different kind of evidence one of the primary mistake that mark the advocacy of an idea a psuedo-science be that the advocacy lack any sense of proportion regard the kind of evidence relate to the propose claim the kind of evidence that be actually relevant to it and the historical reason in the field that certain kind of evidence be give more weight than other it be perfectly alright to speculate i have read quite a few referee paper that speculate leave and right but the author be careful to identify the notion a speculative to list what little evidence wa presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm foot or to uncover it problem often what distinguish whether a paper of thi sort pas muster be the thoughtfulnes with which the author set the context and pave the way for future work it be in thi area that many proponent of speculative idea fail the folk over in have a hundred and one excuse not to make thi simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioner many of whom make a barely marginal live from their practice can ill afford to do most of them be also just plain not interest because the whole idea seem frivolou and since they not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible reward to gain from scientific acceptance i think a lot of scientist steer away from thing that deserve or not garner a patina of kookines when proponent of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that set alarm ring in many researcher mind thi be unfortunate because there be undoubtedly some intersection between thing that be worth investigate and thing that be advocate by those who seem careles or unreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i can understand why many scientist would just a soon select other direction for research a gordon bank ha point out no one want to become thi generation rhine one academic in say that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobium cure since it ha be describe in a scientific journal i think thi be absurd actually at least one fairly careful academic study ha be do with favorable result but it apparently not acceptable because it a doctoral dissertation and not publish in a referee journal i wonder why the result be not publish in my field dissertation result be typically summarize in paper that be submit to journal often the paper be accept for publication before the dissertation be finish thi certainly ease one defense finally i hope lee lady will forgive me from comment either on nlp or the discussion of it in i know little about either and so have nothing to offer russell
