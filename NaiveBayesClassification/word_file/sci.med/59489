from hbloom heather subject re earwax hi stephen ear wax be a healthy way to help prevent ear infection both by prevent a barrier and also with some antibiotic property too much can block the external auditory canal the hole in the outside of the ear and cause some hear problem it be very simple and safe to remove exces wax on ymy own or at ymy physician office you can take a syringe no needle and fill it with warm water cold can cause faint and otc hydrogen peroxide then point the ear toward the ceiling about degree up and insert the tip of the syringe help to have someone else do thi and firmly expell the solution depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax thi could take several rinse if you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier you can buy a syringe with a special tip at ymy local pharmacy or just use whatever you may have if wax be old it will be harder and darker you can try add a few drop of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax do thi for a couple day then try syringe again it be also safe to point ymy ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse it out good luck heather
