from houle paul houle subject antihistamine for sleep aid for a very long time i have a problem with feel really awful when i try to get up in the morning my sleep latency at night be also pretty long range from min to an hmy i get about hour of bedtime maybe of actual sleep a night and more on the weekend i will spend two or three hour lay in bed after thi if i can because i feel so tire when i wake up even more tire than i wa when i go to bed which be usually too tire to work anyway i recently have a really bad flu so i call a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant but he get vick formula which ha everything but an expectorant so i use that anyway and the three night i use it i fell asleep rapidly and felt that i get really good quality sleep that be i actually felt refresh the next morning so i be now try to look into both in the literature and experimentally the use of antihistamine a sleep aid since i be presume that it wa the antihistamine that cause the effect the antihistamine in vick formula be chloriphenamine maleate so i buy some generic tablet of that and try one last night and do notice any improvement i might try one with a little alcohol about beer to see if it be a synergism effect also library research seem to show that benadryl be the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what be availible otc so i might also buy a generic form of that and try that the pdr seem to suggest that mg be a good dosage level to try for other medical information i have allergy but rarely have an allergic reaction live in new mexico i also have chronically dry eye which get horrible if i try to use most underarm deoderant i do gues that my problem might be cause by hypoglycemium so i make some change in my diet consistent with that and it do help so i go back to a normal diet pretty diverse also take vitamin supplement anyway i be look for advice for the use of antihistamine a sleep aid and if there be any danger of such use seem safe to me since they be use chronically for allergy by million i do want to try bz because bz addiction seem to be a seriou threat and from what i hear bz sleep quality be not good wherea antihistamine sleep quality seem to be better for me i have try some dietary tryptophan load stuff and that also seem to lower sleep quality i seem to wake up around or so and be in some kind of mental haze until or also i would be interest in any other advice for help my problem although i already try many of the non-pharmacological solution
