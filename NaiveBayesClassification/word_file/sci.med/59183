from noring jon noring subject great post wa re candida yeast bloom very long great post martin very informative well-balanced and humanitarian without neglect the need for scientific rigor cross-posted to since some personality type will be discuss at the begin note i set all followup to since most of my comment be more orient and i sure most of the reply if any will be med-related in article banschbach write i can not believe the way thi thread on candida yeast ha progress steve dyer and i have be exchange word over the same topic in scus med nutrition when he display hi typical reserve and attack a woman poster for be treat by a licence physician for a disease that do not exist calling thi physician a quack wa reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the other be do it here a well they be just respond in their natural way hyper-choleric syndrome hc oop that be not a recognize illnes in the psychological community better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist actually it be fascinate that a disproportionate number of physician will type out a nt for those not familiar with the myers-brigg system just e-mail me and i send a summary file to you in the general population nt comprise only about of the population but among physician it be much much higher i do know the exact percentage any help here one drive characteristic of an nt especially an ntj be their obviou choleric behavior driver type a etc the extreme emotional need to control to lead to be the best or the most competent if they be also extroverted they be best describe a field marshall thi trait be very valuable and essential in my society we need person who want to lead to strive to overcome the element to seek and thirst for knowledge to raise the level of competency etc the great success in science and technology be in large part due to the vision an n trait and scientifically mind approach t trait of the nt personality of course the other type and temperament have their own positive contribution a well however when the nt person ha self-image challenge the dark-side of thi personality type usually come out which should be obviou to all a physician who be a strong nt and who ha not learn to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like lack of empathy or feel and be very compel to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedient to their diagnosi and prescription without question i know many of thi temperament and suffice to say i do oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent i think they be and they usually be very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that be an extreme drive of their to know the most to know it all maybe we need more nf doctor enough on thi subject let move on to candida bloom let me tell you who the quack really be these be the physican who have no idea how the human body interact with it environment and how that balance can be alter by diet and antibiotic could it just be professional jealousy i could help elaine or jon but somebody else do you help me already by ymy post of course i believe that i have be misdiagnosed on the net a suffer from retentivitis but be the phlegmatic i be maybe i wa just a little too harsh on a few person myself in past post let all try to raise the level of thi discussion above the level of anal effluent human have all kind of different organism live in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuse vagina and on the skin these be nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in person unles the immune system be compromise they be also call nonpathogen because unlike the pathogenic organism that cause human disease they do not produce toxin a they live out their merry existence in and on my body but any of these organism will be consider pathogenic if it manage to take up residence within the body a poor mucu membrane barrier can let thi happen and vitamin a be mainly responsible for set up thi barrier in my well-described situation in prior post i definitely wa immune stress blood test show my vitamin a level be very low my sinuse be a me no doubt the mucosal line and the cilium be heavily damage i also wa on antibiotic time in year in the end even two week of ceftin do not work and i have confirm diagnosis of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuse vium cat-scan mucu color wo get into the detail and other symptom three very traditional ent make thi diagnosi i do not have any culture do however because of the difficulty of do thi right and because my other symptom clearly show a bacterial infection enough of thi background provide to help you understand where i wa when i make comment about my sporanox anti-fungal therapy below the first question i have be thi can fungu penetrate a little way into poor mucu membrane tissue maybe vium hypha thu cause symptom without be consider in the classic sense it be sort of an inbetween infection steve get real upset with elaine doctor because he wa use anti-fungal and vitamin a for her gi problem if steve really understoood what vitamin a do in the body he would not or at least should not be call elaine doctor a quack i wa concern too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor after my blood test put me on iu of vitamin a for one week only then drop it down to iu for the next couple of week i also receive zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly complex way a my doctor explain he one of those orthomolecular specialist i have a blood test three week later and vitamin a wa normal he then stop me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi-vitamin supplement and make sure that i maintain a of betum carotene call me carrot face hopefully elaine doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplement i even reevaluate some supplement i take for example niacin in fairly large dosage which steve dyer have good information about on if niacin only ha second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinu allergy then it probably be not worth take such a large dose long-term and risk liver damage survife if it get acces to a lot of glucose it bloom and over ride the other organism live with it in the sinuse gi tract or vagina in though i do now believe base on my successful therapy with sporanox that i definitely have some excessive growth of fungu unknown specie in my sinuse i still want to ask the question have there be any study that demonstrate candida bloom in the sinuse with associate sinu irritation my sinu irritation reduce significantly after one week of sporanox and no other new treatment be implement during thi time i do not have any noticeable gi track problem before start on sporanox but some for a few day after which then go away consider normal btw my doctor dig out one of hi medical reference book sorry ca remember which one and find an obscure comment date back into the which state that person can develop contain non-lethal or non-seriou aspergillus infestation aspergiliosi of the sinuse lead to sinu inflammation symptom i have to dig out that reference again since it be relevant to thi discussion some person do really develop a bad inflammatory proces at the mucu membrane or skin bloom site whether thi be an allergic like reaction to the candida or not be certain my doctor test me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergic response to specificially candida albican and i show a strong positive another question would everybody show the same strong positive so thi test be essentially useles and assume it be true that candida can grow part-way into the mucu membrane tissue and the concentration exceed a threshold amount could not a person who test a have an allergy to candida definitely develop allergic symptom such a mucu membrane irritation due to the body allergic response a i say in an earlier post one do not need to be a rocket scientist or have a degree or a in biochemistry to see the plausibility of thi hypothesi btw and i repost thi again dr ivker in hi book sinu survival ha routinely give before anything else nizoral a pre-sporanox systemic anti-fungal not a safe and not a good a sporanox to hi new chronic sinusitis patient if they have be on antibiotic fmy or more time in the last two year he claim that out of or so patient well over notice some relief of sinu inflammation and other symptom but it do cure it by any mean imply the so-called infection be not the primary cause but a later complication he also find that nystatin whether take internally or put into a sinu spray do not help thi imply of course assume that excessive bloom be aggravate the sinu inflammation that the ha grow partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill other than by direct contact it be not absorb into the blood stream again i admit lot of and which do please the hard-core nt who ha to have the double-blind study or it a non-issue but one ha to start with some plausible a strawman if you will if it internal only symptom can be use and these symptom be pretty nondescript thi bring up an interest observation use by those who will deny and reject any and all aspect of the hypothesi until the appropriate study be do and that be if you ca observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinu then there no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease and i know they realize that it be virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that can not be easily observe since candida be everywhere in the body it a real another those who totally reject the hypothesi say that no study have be do actually study have be do but if it not up to a certain standard then it be from their perspective a non-study which should not even be consider i agree that the appropriate study should be do and that will take big to do it right however in order to convince the fund agency in these austere time to open their wallet you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposal be paradoxically to do almost the exact study need fund that be you have to do of the study before you even get fund a a scientist at a national lab i very aware of thi for the smaller fund project i afraid that even if dr ivker and other doctor get together pool their practice case history and anecdote into a compel picture and approach the fund agency they would get nowhere even if they be able to publish their statistical result it be obviou from the comment by some of the doctor here be that they have decide excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuse lead to noticeable non-lethal symptom do not exist and be not even a tenable hypothesi so any amount of case history or compile anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the need study because in their mind it a do issue excessive yeast growth lead to diffuse allergic symptom do not will not and can not exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint kind of remind me of lister candida be keep in check in most person by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuse the gi tract mouth stomach and intestine and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally do not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organism unles they broach the mucu membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most american be not get enough vitamin a from their diet about of all american die with le vitamin a than they be bear with autopsy study while thi low level of vitamin a do not cause pathology blindnes it do impair the mucu membrane barrier system thi would then be a predispose factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom are there also other nutrient necessary to the proper work of the sinu mucu membrane and cilium while diabetic can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of thi type of bloom be the use of broad spectrum antibiotic which knock down many different kind of bacterium in the body and remove the main competition for candida a far a food be concern while drug be available to handle candida many patient find that their doctor will not use them unles there be evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti-fungal drug do warrant some caution but if the gi or sinu inflammation be suspect to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic be the smoke gun then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just a the anti-fungal cream be an appropriate treatment for recur vaginal yeast infection in spite of what mr steve dyer say again the evidence from mycological study indicate that many specie can grow hypha root into deep tissue similar to mold grow in bread you can continue to kill the surface such a nystatin do but you ca kill that which be deeper in the tissue without use a systemic anti-fungal such a itraconazole sporanox or some of the older one such a nizoral which be more toxic and not a effective thi be why a ha be point out by recent study send to me by a doctor i be in e-mail contact with thank that nystatin be not effective in the long term treatment of gi tract candidiasi it like try to weed a garden by cut off what above the grind but leave the root ready to come out again once you walk away the question be whether a contain candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucu membrane cause some type of symptom in susceptible person allergy without become systemic in the classical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessive bloom not cause any problem and the full-blown systemic infection that be potentially lethal in the gi system the ano-rectal region seem to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many woman create a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive way to minimmize thi transfer be to wear undyed cotton underwear also if one be an retentive like i be diagnose in a prior post that can also provide more site for excessive candida growth if the bloom occur in the anal area the burn swell pain and even blood discharge make many patient think that they have hemorroid if the bloom manage to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occur abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool thi positive stool for occult blood be what send elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive test he tell her that there wa nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan ha tell me throiugh e-mail that he consider occult blood test in stool specimen to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positive candida bloom guy if my gut hurt me on a constant basi i would want it fix ye it nice to know that i do have colon cancer but what then be cause my distres when i finally find a doctor who treat me and get me better steve dyer call him a quack a i say in private e-mail there be flaw in my current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapy after the therapy do work for example i go to three ent who all say that i will just have to live with my sinusitis after the ab fail they do mention surgery to open up the ostium but my ostium be plug and it would not get to the root cause of my condition after three month of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitor and equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health ha vastly improve to where i wa two year ago before my health greatly deteriorate of course skeptic would say that maybe if i do nothing i would have improve anyway but that view be stretch thing quite far because of the experience of the three ent i saw who say that i just have to live with it i confident i will reach what one could call a total cure the anti-fungal program i undertake wa one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab for the last fmy year note for those have sinu problem may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention above be sure to get the revise edition i have often wonder what an with chronic gi distres or sinu problem would do about the problem that he tell hi patient be a non-existent syndrome dr ivker start off have chronic and severe sinu problem and hi visit to several ent totally floor him when they say you just have to live with it he spend several year try everything standard and non-standard until he wa essentially cure of chronic sinusitis he now share hi approach in hi book and i can honestly say that i be on the road to recovery follow some part of it hi one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the begin of treatment if you have a history of anti-biotic overuse ha be prove to him time and time again in hi own practice i sure if i comment to him of the hard-core belief of the antus yeast hypothesi poster that he would have definite thing to say such a it work wonder for me in almost two thousand case to put it mildly i also would not be surprise if he would say that they be the one violate their moral obligation to help the patient maybe those doctor who be read thi who have a practice and be confront by a patient have symptom that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth they fit some of the profile the pro-yeast person have identify should consider anti-fungal therapy if all other avenue have be exhaust remember theory and practice be two different thing you can not have one without the other they be synergistic if a doctor do something non-standard yet produce noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of hi patient should you at least sit up and take notice maybe you ought to trust what he say and begin hypothesize why it work instead of why it should work i afraid a lot of doctor have become so enamor with scientific correctnes that they be ignore the patient they have swear to help you have to do both both have to be balance which we do see from some of the poster to thi group there come a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach such a try a good systemic anti-fungal such a sporanox after have exhaust all the other avenue i wa one of those who the traditional medical establishment wa not able to help so i do the natural thing i go to a couple of doctor who be somewhat outside thi establishment and a a result i have find significant relief would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of be sue or have hi license pull can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt therapy for patient that finally reach the point where all the accept therapy be ineffective i like to hear a doctor tell me well i try all the therapy that be approve and accept in thi country and since they clearly do work for you i now have the authority to use experimental unproven technique that seem to have help other i ca promise anything and there be some risk you will have to sign something say you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapy and i have to register ymy case at the state board anyway if my ent have suggest thi to me i would jump on thi pronto instead of go to one of those doctor who for either altruistic reason or for greed be practice these alternative therapy with much risk to risk mean lose their license and possibly to the patient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable datum that would essentially be free it also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by show the compassion of the medical community to the patient that it do everything it can within reason to help the patient it be the lack of such a mechanism that be lead large number of person to try alternative therapy some of which seem to work like my case and other of which will never work at all true quackery i better get off my soapbox before thi post reach in size if take orally it can also become a major bacterium in the gut through aresol spray it ha also be use to innoculate the sinu membrane but before thi innoculation occur the mucu membrane barrier system need to be strengthen thi be accomplish by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b-complex vitamin diet survey repeatedly show that american be not get enough and folate these be probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with thi non-existent disorder candida bloom after antibiotic therapy what dosage of appear to be necessary to promote the heal and proper work of the muco memebrane some of the above material wa obtain from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale pres a well a note from my human nutrition course i will be post a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference cite to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a play in the mucu membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in deal with candida bloom another effective dietary treatment be to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase thi be especially important if the gi system be involve if candida can not get glucose it not go to out grow the bacterium and you then give bacterium which can use amino acid and fatty acid for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate be return to the gut i like to see the role of complex carbohydrate such a starch if steve and some of the other nay-sayer want to jump all over thi post fine i jump all over steve in scus med nutrition because he verbably accost a poster who wa seek advice about her doctor use of vitamin a and anti-fungal for a candida bloom in her gut person seek advice from newsnet should not be treat thi way those of u give of my time and knowledge can slug it out to my heart content if you save ymy venom for me steve and leave the helples poster who be timidly seek help alone i would have a problem with ymy behavior brave soul you be the venom on usenet can be quite toxic unles one develop an immunity to it one year ago my phlegmatic self would have back down right away from an attack of cholericitis but my immune system and my computer system have be harden from gradual desensitization i now kind of like be call anal retentive it ha a nice ring to it i also wa very impress by how it just flow into the post truly classic worthy of a blue or maybe brown ribbon i might even cross-post it to hmmm martin banschbach professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine thank again for a great and informative post i hope other who have research thi area and be lurk in the background will post their think a well no matter their view on thi subject jon noring charter member
