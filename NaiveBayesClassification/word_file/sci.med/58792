from lady lee lady subject re science and methodology wa homeopathy tradition avoiding mistake be certainly highly desirable however it be also widely acknowledge that perfectionism be inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life perfectionism carry beyond a certain point be indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist become so paralyze by all the possible mistake he might make that he be unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover a much truth about the world a possible and we also want to have a much certainty a possible about these discovery usually there be some trade-off between these two desideratum the search for scope and the search for certainty if century mathematician have demand total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculu today because neither of the two could explain calculu in a way that really make sense since they lack the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack of a rigorou foundation they make a number of error in their use of calculu it wa only a hundred year later that weistras wa able to give a solid ground for the idea of newton and leibniz nonetheles what newton and leibniz do wa undoubtedly science and mathematics gain a great deal more from the application of their important idea than it lose through the mistake they make in article king dick king write somebody write i doubt if einstein use any formal methodology he also propose numerou experiment which if perform would distinguish a universe in which special relativity hold from one in which it do not einstein play by the rule which demand that hypothesis only be put out there if there exist a specific experiment that could disprove them these be not the rule accord to many who post to and according to these poster if it not support by carefully design control study then it not science taken to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical study be everything and idea be nothing result in a complete stultification of science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology result in a sort of scientific trade-unionism where those outside the establishment and lack institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hear i do in the least believe that thi be the intention of the arbiter of scientific methodology nonetheles it be one of the result and although institutional science ha certainly produce many wonderful result i think it be a foolish arrogance for scientist to believe that no one outside the establishment and use le than perfect empirical methodology will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore the big buck approach to science promote what i think be one of the most significant error in science choose to investigate question because they can be readily handle by the currently fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them instead of direct attention to those question which seem to have fundamental significance for instance certain question can not be easily investigate with statistical method because the relevant factor be not quantitative one could argue that thi be the case for almost all question in many area of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the paper result from the attempt by psychologist to force these question into a statistical framework gife the lie to russell turpin assertion that current scientific method avoid all know error i think that ask the wrong question be probably the most fundamental error in science ignoring potentially valuable idea be one of the other and i think that scientific journal be full of all too many study do with impeccable empirical method but which be worthles because the wrong question wa ask in the first place in the argument between behaviorist and cognitivist psychology seem le like a science than a collection of compete religiou sect lady lady
