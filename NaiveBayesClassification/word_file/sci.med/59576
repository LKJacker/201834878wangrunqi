from mavmav michael a vincze subject re chromium for weight los in article write there be no datum to show chromium be effective in promote weight los the few study that have be do use chromium have be very flaw and inher ently bias the investigator be make money from market it theoretically it really doesnt make sense either the claim be that chromium will increase muscle ma and decrease fat of course chromium be also use t o cure diabetes high blood pressure and increase muscle ma in athlete just a well a anabolic steroid sound like snake oil for the where be ymy reference i have be unable to find study that state that chromium cure diabetese it can reduce the amount of insulin you have to take high blood pressure i have never hear of thi claim before anabolic steroid i have also never hear of thi claim before sound like you be make thing up and stretch the truth for god know what reason did somebody pi you off at one time on the other hand it really cant hurt you anywhere but ymy wallet and place bo effect of anything can be pretty dramatic i agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself be likely to make a fat person thin but it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an important contribution to good health it be important to exercise and also avoid fat calory chromium picolinate ha show to reduce fat and increase lean muscle i will not bore you with the statistic you would believe these anyway chromium picolinate be an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium chromium play a vital role in sensitize the body tissue to the hormone insulin weight gain in the form of fat tend to impair sensitivity to insulin and thu in turn make it harder to lose weight insulin directly stimulate protein synthesi and retard protein breakdown in muscle thi protein spar effect of insulin tend to decline during low calorie diet a insulin level decline which result in los of muscle and organ tissue by sensitize muscle to insulin chromium picolinate help to preserve muscle in dieter so that they burn more fat and le muscle preservation of lean body ma ha an important long-term positive effect on metabolic rate help dieter keep off the fat they lose chromium picolinate promote efficient metabolism by aid the thermogenic heat produce effect of insulin insulin level serve a a rough index of the availability of food calory so it not at all surprise that insulin stimulate metabolism note that i do not say that chromium picolinate increase metabolism in summary you need to change ymy life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy a reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than of calory eating fat make you fat b increase dietary fiber low in calory high in nutrient c get regular aerobic exercise at least time a week burn calory d take chromium picolinate daily lose fat keep muscle reference kaat gr fisher ja blum k abstract american aging association annual meeting denver october evan gw int j biosoc med re page tg ward tl southern ll j animal scus suppl abstract felig p clin physiol kimball sr jefferson l diabetes metab rev fukugawa nk minaher kl rowe jw et al j clin invest fehlmann m freychet p biol chem pittman cs suda ak chamber jb jr ray gy metabolism danforth e jr am j clin nutr mccarty mf med hypoth bielinski r schutz y jequier e am j clin nutr young jc treadway jl balon tw garva hp ruderman nb metabolism best regard michael vincze mav
