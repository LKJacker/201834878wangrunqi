from banschbach subject re how often do kid fall sick etc in article ashwin ashwin ram write my son ha start fall sick quite often every since he start go to day care he wa at home for the first year and he do not fall sick even once now it seem like he ha some sort of cold or flu pretty much once a month most of the time the cold lead to an ear infection a well with the result that he end up be on antibiotic week out of i know kid in day care fall sick more often but we be begin to wonder how often more often really be whether my son be more susceptible or ha lower immunity than average are there any study that can help answer some of these question when kid stay in the home until kindergarden or grade infection incidence wa much lower because exposure wa lower some study suggest that early exposure to variou infectiou disease be probably beneficial because exposure a an adult carry much more risk of morbitity and mortality mumps measles etc how often do kid in their first second and third year fall sick how often do they get cold flu ear infection is there any datum on home care v day care daycare will alway carry a higher exposure risk than home care do be sick build immunity lead to le illnes later do it make kid weaker lead to more illnes later or do it not have any long term effect exposure to infectiou organism do build immunity but many viruse mutate and reexposure to the new strain require another immune response new antibody production in addition antibody level tend to decline with time and re-innoculation be need to keep the antibody level high chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but thi be rare and very unlikely to occur in child do take antibiotic on a regular basi have any negative long term effect ye chronic use of antibiotic can have an adverse effect on the good bacterium that be suppose to be present in and on the body health effect of thi depletion of the good bacterium be a very hotly debate topic in the medical community with most physician seem to discount any health effect of chronic antibiotic use a view that i do not support how do one tell if a child be more susceptible to illnes than normal and what do one do about it chronic infection in an adult or a child need to be work up in my opinion but most physician feel that chronic infection in a child be normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectiou disease i do not share thi view and there be some physician who also suspect that diet play a big role in infection frequency and severity exposure to an infectiou agent do not have to result in a severe infection a strong immune response can minimize the length of time need to deal with the infection a well a the symptom associate with the infection is there any way to build immunity and resistance there be five major nutrient that be responsible for a good strong immune response to infectiou agent they be protein vitamin c vitamin a iron and zinc the american diet be not low in protein so thi be rarely a problem but vitamin a vitamin c iron and zinc be often low and thi lack of an adequate pool nutrient reserve can impair the immune response iron be know to be low in most kid a be vitamin a there be distinct biochemical test that can be run to check the statu of each of these nutrient in a patient who be have a problem with chronic severe infection serum ferritin for iron statu dark adaptation for vitamin a statu red blood cell zinc for zinc statu and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin c statu i have attempt to work up post on these five nutrient and their role in infection for thi news group a well a the other that i participate in i can e-mail you what i work up so far but my best advice to you be to try to find a physician who recognize the critical role that diet play in the human immune response you may also be able to get help from a nutritionist anyone can call themself a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull you want to find someone like myself who ha have some formal train and education in nutrition many program in the now offer degree in nutrition and that what you need to look for some dietician will also call themself nutritionist but most dietician have not have the biochemical train need to run specialize nutritional assessment test they be very good for get general dietary advice from however any datum information or advice relate to thi would be much appreciate thank a lot ashwin martin banschbach graduate degree in biochemistry and nutrition from vpus and developer of a course on human nutrition for medical student
