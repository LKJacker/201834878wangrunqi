from noring jon noring subject re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article nodrog gordon rubenfeld write marty you also change the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptom noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptom there be significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trial are we talk about real candida infection the whole yeast connection hypothesi the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in human or the ability of anecdotally effective therapy challenge by a negative randomize trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesi post hoc ergo propter hoc we ca seem to focu in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesi under discussion i lose point i begin to see that part of the disagreement about the whole yeast issue be on differ perception and on differ mean of word medical doctor have a very specific and specialize jargon necessary for precise communication within their field which i fully cognizant of since i too speak jargonese when with my peer for the situation in many time the word or phrase use by doctor can have a different and more specific mean than the same word use in the world at large cause significant miscommunication one example word and very relevant to the yeast discussion be the exact mean of systemic it be now obviou to me that the mean of thi word be very specific much more so than it mean to a non-doctor there be also the observation of thi newsgroup that both doctor and non-doctor come together on essentially equal term which when combine with the jargon issue can further fan the flame thi be probably the first time that practice doctor get really beat up by non-doctor for their view on medicine which they otherwise do see much of in their practice except for the occasional difficult patient point i understand the viewpoint among many practice doctor that they will not prescribe any for their patient unles such treatment have be show to be effective and the risk understand from well-constructed clinical trial usually double-blind or that such be part of an approve and fund clinical trial to these doctor to do any differently would in thi belief system be unethical practice and it follow that any therapy not on the accept list be therefore a non therapy it do not even exist nor do the underlie hypothesi or theory have any validity even if it sound very plausible by extrapolation of what be currently know anecdotal evidence ha no value either from a treatment point-of-view and by and large a a scientist myself i be glad that medical practice science take such a rigorou approach to medical treatment however a also be a human be last i check and have be one of those person that ha be significantly help by a currently unaccepted treatment where standard medicine wa not able to help me ha cause me to sit back and wonder if hold such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint be in itself unethical from humanitarian consideration after all the underlie intent of the scientific approach to medicine be to protect the health of the patient by provide the best possible care for the patient so the patient should come first when consider treatment what we need be a slightly modify approach to treatment that satisfy both the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoint in an earlier post i outline a crazy idea for do just that the gist of it wa to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate not yet prove therapy maybe support by anecdotal evidence for patient who all avenue of accept therapy have be exhaust and not until then the patient would be fully inform that such be not support by the proper clinical trial and that there be real potential risk with real possibility of no benefit derive from them thi approach satisfy the need for scientific rigor it also satisfy the humanitarian need of the patient and the reality be that many patient who have reach a dead-end in the treatment of their symptom use accept medicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to the doctor who be brave enough to prescribe such treatment at the risk of lose their license or worse to non-doctor who have not have the proper medical train thi approach also recognize thi reality and keep the control more within orthodox medicine with the benefit that the information glean could help focu limit resource toward future clinical trial in the most productive way everybody win in thi admittedly rose-colored approach i sure there be real problem with thi approach a well it be present more a a strawman to stimulate discussion hopefully what i write here may give the doctor a better idea a to why i be open to alternative therapy a well a why i have real difficulty read apparent hostility with the coldnes of the pure scientific approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medical treatment be one where both the humanitarian aspect be balance with and by the scientific aspect anything else be just not good medicine imho just my lean i gues comment jon noring charter member infj club if you die to know what infj mean be brave e-mail me i send info jon noring noring jkn international
