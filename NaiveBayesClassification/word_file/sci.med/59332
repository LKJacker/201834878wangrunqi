from banschbach subject re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article rind david rind write in article banschbach write be in a different clas the big question seem to be be it reasonable to use them in patient with gi distres or sinu problem that could be due to candida bloom follow the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic i gues i still not clear on what the term candida bloom mean but certainly it be well know that thrush superficial candidal infection on mucou membrane can occur after antibiotic use thi ha nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack diagnosi that ha be be discuss find in the sinu mucu membrane than be candida woman have be know for a very long time to suffer from candida bloom in the vagina and a woman be lucky to find a physician who be will to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the otc anti-fungal cream lucky how since a recent article randomize control trial of oral yogurt on reduce vaginal candidiasi i mention to a number of patient with frequent vaginal yeast infection that they could try eat ounce of yogurt daily it turn out most would rather just use anti-fungal cream when they get yeast infection yogurt dangerou if thi be a standard part of medical practice a gordon r say it be then the incidence of gi distres and vaginal yeast infection should decline again thi just be what the systemic yeast syndrome be about and ha nothing to do with the quack therapy that be be discuss there be some evidence that attempt to reinoculate the gi tract with bacterium after antibiotic therapy do seem to be very helpful in reduce diarrhea but i do think anyone would view thi a a quack therapy david rind yogurt contain lactobacillu acidophilu and l bulgaricu l acidophilu be the major bacterium in the vaginal tract and be primarily responsible for keep the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free most of the commercial yogurt sell in the ha a very low l acidophilu and l bulgaricu count neither of these bacterium be obligate anaerobe with be much more important in deal with the diarrhea problem gordon r ha tell me through e-mail that he gife hi patient l acidophilu and several different obligate anaerobe which set-up shop in the colon but he ha tell me which one yet the lactobacillu genus be mostly facultative anaerobe and will set-up shop where they have acces to oxygen if give a chance mouth anu sinu cavity and vagina having these good bacterium around will greatly decrease the chance of candida bloom in the anal region or the vagina i have not propose a systemic action for candida bloom i know that other swear that all kind of symptom arise from the evil yeast bloom in the body i not ready to buy that yet i do believe that complication at specific site vagina anal and maybe lower colon sinu and mouth can result from antibiotic use which remove the compete bacterium from these site and thu let candida grow unchecked restoring the right bacterial balance be the best way in my opinion to get rid of the problem anti-fungal a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin a supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacterium can take over control of the food supply again and lower the ph to basically starve the candida out marty b
