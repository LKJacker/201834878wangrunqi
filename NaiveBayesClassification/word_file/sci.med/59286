hiv-positive patient wa determine to have be most probably infect in during a transfusion there wa no hiv transmission in person-hour of surgical exposure suggest that hiv transmission to patient be unlikely to occur more frequently than once per person-hour of surgical exposure the researcher determine there be no evidence to suggest that the surgeon fail to adhere to standard infection-control guideline over percent of the patient with invasive procedure choose to be test and of those whose result be reveal only one person wa find to be infect with hiv the study patient infection wa probably the result of a taint blood transfusion receive in a a result there be no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hiv-positive surgeon to any patient transpire the researcher conclude april drug concern to share aid datum new york time p kolatum gina a total of major pharmaceutical company have decide in a highly unusual move to share aid drug and information while the drug be undergo early clinical test dr edward scolnick president of the merck research laboratory in rahway arrange the collaboration he say that cooperation between company seem increasingly significant a it have become clear that combination of drug be likely to be more effective in fight hiv than any drug use alone the researcher be hopeful that hiv when face with a combination of several drug require mutation at different site for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutation at the same time therefore several drug take together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug company do not know what other drug their competitor be develop the new agreement allow company to routinely exchange animal datum and safety datum on new aid drug an agreement like thi will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april company ability to choose the best drug combination much faster and in a much more efficient way say scolnick he also say

be use early in the course of disease while the count of the person give azt be consistently greater than those of patient receive only placebo the first three year of follow-up have show that the proportion of person in the two group progress to overt aid or even to death be not significantly different at roughly percent the conclusion be that azt be not an effective aid drug in hiv-infected individual and that cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aid in infect person but nothing be imply by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptom have already appear there be no case for abandon that treatment at least on the evidence now available it be much more alarm that the count ha prove to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aid researcher should acknowledge hiv be alive from the begin of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understand of the pathogenesi of aid conclude maddox infective and anti-infective property of breastmilk from woman lancet vol no p van de perre philippe

and igm in percent percent and percent in child who survive longer than month the risk of infection wa associate with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mother milk the presence of infect cell in the milk day post partum wa strongly predictive of infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysi the combination of infect cell in breastmilk and a defective igm response
