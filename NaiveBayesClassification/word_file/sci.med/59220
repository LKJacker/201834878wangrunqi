from bmdelane brian man delaney subject re diet for crohn ibd one thing that i have see in thi thread be a discussion of the relation between ibd inflammation and the profile of ingest fatty acid fa i wa diagnose last may of the terminal ileum when i get out of the hospital i read up on it a bite and come acros several study investigate the role of epa an essentially fa in reduce inflammation the evidence wa mix many of these study be discuss in inflammatory bowel disease macdermott stenson but if i recall correctly there be some methodological bone to be pick with the study both the one and result in the study patient be give epa a few for most of the study but if i recall correctly there wa no restriction of the other fa that the patient could consume from the inform layperson perspective thi seem mistake if lot of fa be consume along with the epa then the ratio of bad prostanoid product to good prostanoid product could still be fairly bad is thi ratio the issue what the view of the gastro community on epa these day epa supplement along with a fairly severe restriction of other fa appear to have help me significantly though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat i eat calory brian bmdelane
