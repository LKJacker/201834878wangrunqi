from mhollowa michael holloway subject re homeopathy a respectable medical tradition in article homer webster homer write mhollowa michael holloway write here ymy error i really do think thi show some confusion on ymy part drum roll please science be so much the gather of evidence to support an assertion read hypothesi a it be the gather of empirical observation in order to make an hypothesi what should convince you or not should be the final product so much a how the product wa make here ymy error there be no observation or hypothesi that be not taint by theory i have a theory i make observation those observation will be make with my theory in mind ye absolutely though i make the observation in a more general sense of all observation be make by human be and therefore make with variou bias but here ymy message leaf talk of hypothesi and get back once again to equate the busines of science with the end result the gizmo produce science work very well at develop theory within paradigm but be very poor at deal with paradigm shift if i develop a novel paradigm that explain homeopathy chinese medicine or spontaneou combustion if the paradigm be useful it will show me the way to make observation that prove or disprove it my point be so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but how you come about develop it the paradigm of modern medicine be that the body can be reduce to a set of essentially mechanical operation wherein disease be see a malfunction in the machinery essentially the old newtonian model of the world it seem likely that theory base upon thi paradigm do not give a complete discription of the universe medicine heal etc indeed we now recognize an important psychological component to heal perhap you admit that thi be an oversimplification on ymy part the topic of the philosophy of science be make for them i make them too but i think that it also summarize popular misconception of science and the busines of do science biomedical research do make any basic assumption that be the same a any other discipline of scientific research that be that you make empirical observation form an hypothesi and test it modern medicine ha much more to do with biochemistry than the old newtonian model of the world and i doubt that many psychologist would appreciate be put outside thi empirical world view psychology also ha more to do with biochemistry than spoon bend it be also important to distinguish reason from science science may be reasonable but so be many non-scientific methodology aristotle reason that frog come from mud by observe one hop out of a puddle oversimplified of course but a good example thi be an empirical observa tion it wa then test though perhap not by aristotle and eventually find want in the meantime some folk will have continue to believe in the spontaneou generation of animal life there nothing at all surprise about thi it the way the gather of knowledge work there be probably more than a few thing in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be find to be totally off-base even idiotic to someone in the future these future person wo have come to these relevation because they have suddenly go all zen-like and have a vision in an lsd trip someone will have think of something new and test it thi be the bite that person who seem to relish misrepresent science and research ca seem to wrap their mind around science be a creative proces what i think of a factual and good research can be totally turn on it head tommorrow by new result and theory again i think it get down to define what you mean by science i often do recognize what it be that i do and be involve in in the way science be portray by popular medium or write of person in the humanity they portray science a a collection of immutable fact pronouncement of truth in big gold letter that silly it a though we just go into the lab turn over a stone and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula tion it much more interest than that it really be a very human proces
