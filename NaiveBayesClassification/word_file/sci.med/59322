from nodrog gordon rubenfeld subject re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction banschbach write to candida bloom follow the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic gorden rubenfeld through e-mail ha assure me that most physician recognize the chance of candida bloom occur after broad-spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patient with good bacterium to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that thi be yet a standard part of medical practice nor be it mine what i try to explain to marty wa that it be clearly understand that antibiotic exposure be a risk factor for fungal infection which be not the same a say bacterium prevent fungal infection marty make thi sound like a secret know only to veternarian and biochemist anyone who ha treat a urinary tract infection know thi at some center pre-op liver transplant patient receive bowel decontamination direct at retain good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in thi soon-to-be high risk group i also use lactobacillu to treat enteral nutrition associate diarrhea that may be in part due to alteration in gut flora however it be not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patient with good bacterium after antibiotic i have see no datum on thi practice prevent or treat fungal infection in at risk patient whether or not it be a logical extension from the available observation i leave to those of you who base strong opinion and argue over such speculation in the absence of clinical trial one place such therapy ha be describe be in treat particularly recalcitrant case of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there be case report of use stool ie someone else enema to repopulate the patient flora do try thi at home not give give her advise to use the otc anti-fungal cream since candida colonize primarily in the ano-rectal area gi symptom should be more common than vaginal problem after broad-spectrum antibiotic use except that it be at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine ha not and probalby never will be practice thi way there ha alway be the use of conventional wisdom a very good example be kidney stone conventional wisdom because clinical trail have not be do to come up with an effective prevention wa that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalate wa the best way to prevent kidney stone from form clinical trial focus on drug or ultrasonic blast to breakdown the stone once it form through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom wa wrong increase calcium intake be better at prevent stone formation than be restrict calcium intake seem like thi be an excellent argument for ignore anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no datum and do a good clinical trial like au dismukes-w-e wade-j- lee-j-y dockery-b-k hain-j-d ti a randomize double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasi hypersensitivity syndrome see comment so n-engl-j-med dec p psychological test result the three active-treatment regimen and the all-placebo regiman significantly reduce both vaginal and systemic symptom p le than but nystatin do not reduce the systemic symptom significantly more than placebo conclusion in woman with presume candidiasi hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin do not reduce systemic or psychological symptom significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such woman appear to be unwarranted do thi trial addres every issue raise here no jon noring wa not surprise at thi negative trial since they do use sporanox despite crook recommendation for nystatin maybe they do avoid those carbohydrate the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry ha be that animal need to be reinnoculated with good bacterium after come off antibiotic therapy if it make sense for livestock why do it make sense for human david we be not talk about a dangerou treatment unles you consider yogurt dangerou if thi be a standard part of medical practice a gordon r say it be then the incidence of gi distres and vaginal yeast infection should decline marty you also change the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptom noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptom there be significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trial are we talk about real candida infection the whole yeast connection hypothesi the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in human or the ability of anecdotally effective therapy challenge by a negative randomize trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesi post hoc ergo propter hoc we ca seem to focu in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesi under discussion i lose
