from turpin russell turpin subject re great post wa re candida yeast bloom very long in article noring jon noring write if you ca observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinu then there no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease and i know they realize that it be virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that can not be easily observe since candida be everywhere in the body in article geb gordon bank write you just discover one of the requirement for a good quack theory find something that no one can disprove and then write a book say it be the cause of whatever since no one can disprove it you can rake in the buck for quite some time i hope gordon bank do not mean to imply that notion such a hard-to-see candida infection cause variou problem should not be investigate many researcher have make breakthrough by figure out how to investigate thing that be previously think virtually impossible to test for indeed i would be surprise if candida overbloom be such a phenomenon i would think that candida would produce signature byproduct whose measure would then set a lower bind on the extent of recent infection i realize thi might get quite tricky and difficult probably expensive and likely inconvenient or uncomfortable to the subject but that be not the same a virtually impossible russell
