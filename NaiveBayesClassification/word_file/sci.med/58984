from wcsbeau opirg subject re is msg sensitivity superstition in article dyer steve dyer write in article wcsbeau opirg write there ha be no hard info provide about msg make person ill that the point after all why do you just look it up in the merk or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mention earlier in thi thread that because these peer-reviewed study be not address the effect of msg in person they look at animal model you ca walk away from thi and start rant about gloom and doom a if there be any document deleteriou health effect demonstrate in human note that i would have any argument with a statement like note that animal administration ha pro duced the follow blah blah we must be careful about it use in human thi be precisely not what you say among other see olney excitotoxic food aditive relevance of animal study to human safety neurobehav toxicol teratol vol i sure petum would love to hear ymy argument test have be do on rhesu monkey a well i have never see a study where the mode of administration wa intra-ventricular the glu and asp be administer orally some study use iv and sc intra-ventricular be not a normal admin method for food tox study for obviou reason you must not have read the peer-reviewed work that i refer to or you would never have come up with thi brain injection bunk it most certainly be for neurotoxicology you know study of glutamate involve more than food science whose talk about food science what be thi comment suppose to mean neurotoxicology and tratology brain research nature progress in brain research all fine food science journal pardon me but where be you get thi from have you read the journal have you do a thorough literature search so point u to the study in human please i familiar with the literature and i never see any which relate at all to olney work in animal and the effect of glutamate on neuron then you would know that olney himself ha casually refer to chinese restaurant syndrome in a few article why do you point u to some study maybe then thi exchange could be productive the point be exceed the window of course they amino acid note that person with pku can not tolerate any phenylalanine well actually they have to tolerate some phenylalanine it a essential amino acid they just try to get a little a be healthy without produce dangerou level of phenylalanine and it metabolite in the blood they unable to metabolise it olney research compare infant human diet specifically the amount of freely available glu in mother milk versu commercial baby food v typical lunch item from the standard american diet such a package soup mix he find that one could exceed the project safety margin for infant human by at least four-fold in a single meal of process food mother milk wa well below the effective dose goodnes i not say that it good to fee infant a lot of glutamate-supplemented food it just that thi project safety margin be a construct derive from animal model and give that you can prove anything you like we talk prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you misrepresent it a receive wisdom who say anything about wisdom there be no question that orally administer dose of msg be capable of destroy nearly all neuron in the arcuate nucleu of the hypothalamu and the median eminence these area be responsible for the production of hormone critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism human be vertebrate now what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release be miss are you try to say that human have no need of their pituitary anh and me of that part of the brain that be responsible for control the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone how do you expect anyone to do the study on thi it unethical to sacrifice human to check out what effect chronic acute etc dose of these compound be have on the brain tissue in human the food industry know thi that why the animal model be use in medicine and psych if you talk about straight sensitivity it would be useful to define the term there be plenty of study on psychoneuroimmunology show the link between attitude and physiology i suspect we may be argue about separate thing only adult sensitivity you and late-occuring sequela of childhood ingestion and it implication for adult me certainly the dose for excitotoxicity in adult be considerably larger than for the young but the additivity of glu and asp and their copiou and increase presence in modern process food jointly and their hide presence in hvp necessitate extreme caution why would anyone want to eat compound which have be show to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adult the main point be blood level attain and oral dose would likely have to be greater than sc between who over what i would be most interest in see you provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citation to article dispute that msg ha no effect whatsoever you mean assert you be intellectually dishonest or just plain confuse because you conflate report which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other olney report would argue a potential for problem in human infant but that not to say that thi say anything whatsoever about the use of msg in most food nor do he provide any study in human which indicate any deleteriou effect for obviou reason it say nothing about msg contribtion to the phenomenon of the chinese restaurant syndrome it say nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal report of msg sensitivity in the lab olney work provide a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivity terry epelbaum and martin have show that orally administer msg cause change in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutation in adult glu also wa find to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic gh secretion and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adult chronically expose to msg gh be responsible not only for control of growth during development but also convert glycogen into glucose could thi be the cause of headach i do know dyer hmm com why be i not surprise dianne murray wcsbeau probably one of the dumber remark you make if you have read olney review article especially the remark i already quote in an earlier post you would know to what i wa allude may i ask exactly for whom you do computer consult
