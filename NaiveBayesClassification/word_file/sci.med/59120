from kelley stephen kelley subject re should i be angry at thi doctor in article mryan write am i justify in be piss off at thi doctor last saturday even my year old son cut hi finger badly with a knife i take him to a local urgent and general care clinic at pm the story delete be bother my son do get three stitch at the emergency room i still try to find out who be in charge of that clinic so i can write them a letter we will certainly never set foot in that clinic again the person in charge already know what kind of they be provide and they do give a rat a about ymy repeat busines you be much more likely to do some good write to local newspaper and broadcast news show if you do keep the letter short and to the point so they do discard it out of hand and emphasize exactly what you be upset about it possible that the local health department can help you complain to someone official but really that exist for the sole purpose of generate walk-in income through advertise and nothing you can do will change them all you can hope for be to help someone else avoid them i glad it sound like ymy son do ok anyway my opinion only of course steve
