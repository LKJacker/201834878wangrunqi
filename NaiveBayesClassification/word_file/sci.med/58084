from kenneth gilbert subject re contraceptive pill jec write a very simple question it seem to me that the contraceptive pill just prevent the ovule to nest in the vagina and force it to fall every month but it do not prevent the fertilzation of the ovule is it true if ye be there a risk of extra-uterine pregnancy that be the development of the ovule inside the fallopian tube actually that be not how the pill work but it be how the iud work the oral contraceptive pill actually prevent ovulation from occur by provide negatve feedback to the pituitary gland and thu prevent the lh surge that normally occur at the time of ovulation with the iud what happen be that fertilization may occur but the device prevent implantation within the wall of the uteru not the vagina kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh general internal medicine dammit not a programmer
