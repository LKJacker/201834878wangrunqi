from bhjelle subject re my new diet it work great gordon bank a lot to keep from go back to morbid obesity i think all of u cycle one succes depend on how large the fluctuation in the cycle be some person can cycle only pound unfortunately i not one of them thi certainly describe my situation perfectly for me there be a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat which appear to be totally limitles and the purely consciou desire to not put on too much weight when i get too fat i just more with vary degree of succes to take off the extra weight usually i cycle within a lb range but smaller and larger cycle occur a well i alway afraid that thi method will stop work someday but usually i seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check thi be one reason i have a hard time accept the notion of some metabolic derangement associate with cycle diet that result in long-term weight gain i have be cycle diet for at least year without see such a change i think a vigorou exercise program can go a long way toward keep the cycle smaller and the baseline weight low brian
