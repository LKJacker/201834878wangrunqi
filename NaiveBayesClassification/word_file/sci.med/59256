from mary mary e allison subject re is msg sensitivity superstition these be my last word on the subject from lundby walter f lundby write a a person who be very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kid be too i want to know why the food industry want to put msg in food some person think it enhance the flavor i personally do think it help the taste it make me sick so i try to avoid it from dyer steve dyer write sez you such an effect in human ha not be demonstrate in any control study infant mouse and other model be useful a far a they go but they not relevant to the matter at hand which be not to say that i favor it use in thing like baby food a patently ridiculou use of the additive but we have no reason to believe that msg in the diet effect human adversely well i know that msg effect me adversely maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that i like to try to avoid the stuff from kiran kiran wagle write if you do like additive then for godsake get off the net and learn to cook from scratch sheesh excuse me why ca person learn to cook from scratch on the net i get lot of recipe off the net that do use additive if you like additive then get off the net and go to ymy local supermarket buy lot of package food and you get off the net is it to cover up the fact that the recipe are not very good or the food is poor quality ye and you buy it say something about ymy taste eh i do and what happen when the company force to submit to ymy silly notion go out of busines because nobody want to buy their overprice bad food removing preservative directly raise food cost by reduce shelf life hey i pay my hard earn dollar to buy food that cost more but do not have preservative i choose to speak with my pocketbook in many way from kiran kiran wagle you have a good point msg be commonly use in soup in bottle sauce in season mixture and in the coat on barbecue potato chip nacho cheese dorito bread for many freeze fry food like fish and chicken etc ad naseum if msg be really the problem we should call thi barbecue potato chip syndrome or maybe diner syndrome or the and other natural flavor syndrome it be a few year since i buy anything label with and other natural flavor from kiran kiran wagle the reaction came the time the msg wa in the food that wa the only difference same restaurant same ingredient how do you know thi in order to demonstrate ymy claim you would have have to supervise the preparation on both occasion perhap they use msg both time and lie about it perhap once they use something that have begin to spoil and produce some bizarre toxin that you allergic to well i have have similar reaction many time that wa when i really start watching carefully reaction to dorito hey gues what in there reaction to lawry season salt gues what in there i give you a hint i have enough problem with many many many different product with msg that i figure out one thing unles i plan on get sick i wo eat the stuff without my seldane and do i ever learn to read label please note that i be not say you be make it up i be just try to point out that the situation be not alway a simple a it might seem which wa why i start check every time i get sick and every time i get sick msg wa somehow involve in one of the food product and consider there be no other similar ingredient to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it please my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and most importantly it enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proof that my incredibly frugal fiance do flinch when i literally throw out or give away all the food product in hi pantry that have msg and he alway flinch when there waste but it wa a simple explanation i wo eat thi stuff i wo cook with thi stuff so i can either throw it out or give it away from pattee donna pattee my gues wa that the spice mix on the fry contain msg probably lawry season salt i love the way that taste i not say i never consume anything with msg i notice that i have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chip once a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chip will bother me if i also have chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the chinese restaurant the day before from kelley catherine l kelley all that need now be that final step a double-blind study do on human there be even an ethical question about possible harm a thi be a widely use and approve food additive but some say that only of the population ha a problem with msg some say it more like but let say that it how many person would have to be test that would have a problem also i know i have a problem with it and i would volunteer for a test like thank guy but i do want to get sick also i sure that most person probably have vary degree of sensitivity at different time if i have a cold i much more susceptible to the reaction than when i healthy a prove today when i stuffy but for some silly reason i still give in and decide to have the bbq chip from kiran kiran wagle because too many of you generic rhetorical not cathy go around call thi chinese restaurant syndrome thu suggest to the person you complain to that you experience thi only from chinese food msg be prevalent in a lot more thing than chinese food that why i suggest call thi diner syndrome cathy do i have save all my post but i never call it chinese restaurant syndrome and i never state i get it only from chinese food i just think it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a chinese take out place that i know would hold or not hold the msg i ca call up whoever make dorito and ask them to make me one back of chip without msg on the other hand if one complain about potato from a mix or restaurant spice mix i go to believe them and if anyone say they get msg sick after eat too many barbecue potato chip at a party i really go to believe them well i believe i mention that in an earlier post let see you write thi message at date apr but on date apr gmt i write ha anyone have an msg reaction from something other than a chinese restaurant lot of time that why it wa so hard for me to pin down i would probably have be easier if i only have the reaction in a certain type of restaurant but i have the reaction in chinese restaurant and greek restaurant and italian restaurant and steak place i can tell you when a steak joint use accent to tenderize their meat oh and just in case anyone think i prejudice against either chinese food or asian person i not go home to cook some chinese food for the guy i marry next week incidentally hi last name be wu so stop it with the flame mail why do a woman work ten year to change a man habit and then complain that he not the man she marry barbra streisand mary allison mary urbana illinoi
