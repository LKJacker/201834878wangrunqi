from paj paul johnson subject poisoning with heavy water wa re too many mri in article probert paul robert write in article king dick king write i recall read somewhere during my youth in some science popularization book that whyle isotope change do normally affect chemistry a consumption of only heavy water would be fatal and that seed water only with heavy water do not sprout do anyone know about thi i also hear thi i alway think it might make a good eposide of for someone to be poison with heavy water it would show up in any chemical test no one else seem to know so i post thi thi topic come up on shortly after the cold-fusion flap start a i recall it be do to some experimental mouse they show variou ill effect and eventually die the reason be that deuterium do not have exactly the same reaction rate a hydrogen due to it extra ma which cause lower velocity boltzman constant mumble thi throw variou bite of body biochemistry out of kilter and you get sick and die i never hear of anyone be poisened thi way in or out of real life the proces take quite a while if anyone want to write thi book i would imagine you would have to replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy water wait while normal breakdown and repair process cause other molecule in the body to be synthesise use the deuterium during thi proces the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die but i imagine it would take week during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingest wa heavy you would get such a me of symptom that the doctor would be both alarm and confuse why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate if you can figure out how the poisoner get the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here come to think of it would continue even after the heavy water wa no longer be ingest so hospitalisation might be too late the most detectable effect would be that the victim body fluid would literally be heavy water ha a molecular weight of and heavy water ha a mw of thu the victim weight will increase by about for every of body water replace by heavy water maybe the detection occur because some pathologist in the lab notice that the victim urine be strangely dense is there any medical test involve the specific gravity of a body fluid paul paul johnson paj tel ext these idea and other like them can be have gec-marconi research be not for each from any reputable idealist responsible for my opinion
