from turpin russell turpin subject re science and methodology in article lady lee lady write the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist do not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depend on the quality of their thinking it really bother me that so many graduate student seem to believe that they be do science merely because they be conduct empirical study and i especially offend by russell turpin repeat assertion that science amount to nothing more than avoid mistake simply avoid mistake do get you anywhere i think that lee lady and i be talk at cro purpose above lady seem concern with the contrast between great science that make big advance in my knowledge and mediocre science that make smaller step in most of thi thread i have be concern with the difference between what be science and what be not lee lady be correct when she assert that the difference between einstein and the average post-doc physicist be the quality of their think but what be the difference between einstein and a geniu who would be a great scientist but whose great think be scientifically screwy some would give velikovsky or korzybski a example if you do like these choose ymy own i say it be the same a the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi both einstein and the mediocre physcist have discipline their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previou researcher go wrong both velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have fail to do thi let me approach thi from a second direction when one be ask to review a paper for a journal or conference there be many kind of criticism that one can make one kind of criticism be that the work be just wrong or misinform another kind of criticism be that the work while technically correct be either not important or not interest the first difference be the one that i have be point to the second difference be the one that lee lady seem to be discuss if good empirical research be do and show that there be some merit to homeopathic remedy thi would certainly be valuable information but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualify a a science thi be where you and i disagree with turpin i have often point out that for homeopathy to be consider scientific what be need be a test of it theoretical claim not just of some of it propose remedy similarly i suspect that traditional chinese medicine ha many remedy that work what it lack a one example be any experiment that test the presence of qi in order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that make sense not a mere collection of empirically validate random hypothesis certainly a theoretical structure that make sense be the goal in area where we do not yet have thi i see nothing wrong with form and test smaller hypothesis let face it we can not alway wait for an einstein to come along and make everything clear for u sometime those of u who be not einstein have to plug along and make small amount of progress a best we can russell
