from chungdan zhong qi iao daniel subject sleep the pulse of relaxation roam while sleep i post about a pulse of relaxation electricity i now think it more like a pulse of relaxation or comfort than a pulse of electricity it be what you feel if you be overwhelm by a feel of comfort such a see or think about something beautiful another thing when you sleep you lie down face up with ymy palm aside of you and face down on the surface of the bed then you relax and there start involuntary nerve fire inside ymy flesh so you feel a shiver below the surface of the skin not heart-beat then thi shiver increase and come up to ymy head and the roam you hear louden note that you alway hear a high-pitch when you lie down in bed thi be just the noise of ymy blood run in ymy ear thi roam be different from the high pitch but follow the shiver of ymy body shiver be not the word it may be call a mild vibration or quake what be thi shiver and roam can i use thi to induce out-of-body experience daniel chung mr
