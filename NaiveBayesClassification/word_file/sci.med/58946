from ruegg robert g ruegg subject re eugenic subject re eugenic gordon bank write probably within year a new type of eugenic will be possible maybe even sooner we be now map the human genome we will then start to work on manipulation of that genome using genetic engineer we will be able to insert whatever gene we want no breed no hybrid etc the ethical question be should we two past problem with eugenic have be reduce the gene pool and define the statu of the eugenized inserting gene would not seem to reduce the gene pool unles the insert gene later become transmissible to progeny then they may be able to crowd out garbage gene thi may in the future become possible even if it do awarenes of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provision will be make for save gene that may come in handy later evidently the gene for sickle cell disease in equatorial africa and for diabetes in the hopus promote survival in some condition we do really know what the future may hold for my environment the reduce wildernes and disease-survival capacity of my relatively inbred domesticate animal come to mind vulcanism nuclear winter ice age meteor impact new microbiological threat famine global warm etc etc be all conceivable therefore have a many gene a possible available be a good strategy for specie survival of course the statu of genetically alter individual would start out a no different than anyone else but if we could make philosopher-king with great body and long life would we or they want to give them elevate statu we could the roman do it with their king without the benefit of such eugenic the race eventually realize and deal with the problem which that cause but for a while it wa a problem orwell introduce u to the notion of what might happen to person genetically alter for more menial task but there be nothing new under the sun we treat slave the same way for millennium before i see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoid at least these problem human have alway have trouble have the virtue and wisdom to use any power that fall into their hand to good end all the time that ha stop the race a a whole yet many be the civilization which have die from inability to adapt to environmental change however also many be the civilization which have die from the abuse of their own power the one which survive have hopefully learn a lesson from the fate of other and have survive by make better choice when their turn come not that i do think that thi gene alter power could wipe u off the face of the earth or cause endles suffer nuclear power or global warm or whatever could and may still do that too the real issue be an issue of wisdom and virtue i personally do think man ha enough wisdom and virtue to pull thi next challenge off any better than he do the for last few we a eugenist may make it an we may not if we do i hope there be reservoir of garbage person out in some backwater with otherwise long discard garbage gene which will pull u through i believe that the real problem be and will probably alway be the same man need to accept input from the great spirit of god to overcome hi lack in the area of know how to use the power he ha some man have and i believe all man may listen to and obey the still small voice of god in their heart thi be the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue need to escape the problem consequent to poor choice people have die out for many reason the society which fail to accept enough input from god to safely use the power they have develop have destroy themself and often other in the proces it be self-evident that the one which survive today have either accept enough input from the spirit to use their power wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistake thu far or else have have enough power for long enough in summary i would say that the question of whether to use thi new technology be really an ancient one and the answer in some way hard in some way easy be the same ancient answer it be the power it be the spirit sorry for the long post got carry away bob ruegg
