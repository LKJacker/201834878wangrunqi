from sasghm gary merrill subject re science and methodology wa homeopathy tradition in article fulk mark fulk write flight of fancy and other irrational approach be common the crucial thing be not to sit around just have fantasy they be of any use unles they make you do some experiment i know a lot of scientist whose fantasy lead them on to creative work usually they wo admit out loud what the fantasy wa prior to the consumption of a few beer simple example warren jelinek notice an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresi gel of human alu fragment he get very excite hop that he see some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic gene thi fantasy lead him to sequence sample of the band and carry out bind assay the result wa a well-conserved or so bp sequence but why do you characterize thi a a flight of fancy or a fantasy while i be unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appear obviou that hi speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word wa at least in significant part a consequence of hi knowledge of and acceptance of current theory couple with hi observation it would appear that something quite rational wa go on a he attempt to fit hi observation into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation thi do not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy it be not clear to me what you mean by rational v irrational perhap you can give a few example of surprise experiment that be try out for perfectly rational reason or interest new theory that be first advance from logical grind the main example i can think of be from modern high-energy physic which be not typical of science a a whole well i think someone else in thi thread wa the first to use the word also extra-scientific etc nor be i prepare to give a general account of rationality in term of example there be some danger of begin to quibble over what a surprise experiment be what count a surprise etc the same may be say about logical grind my point be that quite frequently perhap even most frequently the root of a new theory can be trace to previously exist theory or even to previously reject hypothesis of some other theory or domain i would offer some rather well know example such a toricelli puy de dome experiment do for the sake of hi sea of air hypothesi wa thi theory and the result experimental test surprise well give the prior explanation of the phenomenon involve it certainly must be count a so wa the theory construct and the experiment design out of perfectly rational grind well there wa a pretty successful and well know theory of fluid the analogy to fluid by toricelli be explicit the novelty wa in think of air a a fluid but thi wa quite a novelty at the time wa the theory interest ye wa it new well one could argue that it wa merely the extension of an exist theory to a new domain but i think thi beg certain question we can debate that if you like gary h merrill principal system developer c compiler development sa institute inc sa campu dr cary nc sasghm mcnc sa sasghm
