from donald mackie subject re ob-gyn residency in article david nye nyeda write i believe it be illegal for a residency to discriminate against fmg is that true i know some that wo even interview fmg i think a case could be make that thi be discriminatory particularly if an applicant have good board score and recommendation but wa offer an interview but i do know if it ha ever go to court fmg who be not citizen be like all alien in a difficult situation only citizen get to vote here so non-citizen be of little or no interest to legislator also the non-citizen may well be in the middle of process for resident alien statu there be a stron sense that rock the boat eg sue a residency program will delay the grant of that statu perhap for ever don mackie hi opinion
