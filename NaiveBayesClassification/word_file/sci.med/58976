from sheffner steve heffner subject hernium a bite more than a year ago a hernium in my right groin wa discover it have produce a dull pain in that area the hernium wa repair use the least intrusive orthoscopic method and a plug and patch the doctor consider the procedure a succes a few month later the same pain return the doctor say that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernium repair now the pain occur more often my gp could identify any specific problem the surgen who perform the original procedure now say that ye there be a new hernium in the same area and he say that he ha to cut into the area for the repair thi time my question to the net is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there be a hernium or if the pain be from something else steve heffner
