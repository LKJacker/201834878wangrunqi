if you ca uncompres a file locally soda will do it just ask for the file without the z extension if you unable to ftp to soda send me e-mail and we see what we can arrange general info on injury first and foremost of importance if you experience pain at all then you absolutely need to go see a doctor a soon a you possibly can the difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn-out ordeal go see a doctor now ymy garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with thi sort of injury generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialist in these kind of problem do wait though go see a doctor the remainder of thi information be paraphrase without permission from a wonderful report by new zealand department of labmy occupational safety and health service occupational overuse syndrome treatment and rehabilitation a practitioner guide first a glossary or fancy name for how you should have ymy hand note you likely to hear these term from doctor and keyboard vendor rsi repetitive strain injury a general term for many kind of injury oo occupational overuse syndrome synonym for rsi ctd cumulative trauma disorder another synonym for rsi wruld work-related upper limb disorder yet another synonym for rsi ct carpal tunnel syndrome see below hyperextension marked bend at a joint pronation turning the palm down wrist extension bending the wrist up supination turning the palm up wrist flexion bending the wrist down pinch grip the grip use for a pencil ulnar deviation bending the wrist toward the little finger power grip the grip use for a hammer radial deviation bending the wrist toward the thumb abduction moving away from the body overspanning opening the finger out wide now then problem come in two main type local condition and diffuse condition local problem be what you expect specific muscle tendon tendon sheath nerve etc be inflame or otherwise hurt diffuse condition often mistake for local problem can involve muscle discomfort pain burn tingle with identifiable area of tendernes in muscle although they not necessarily the problem why do occupational overuse syndrome occur here the theory normally ymy muscle and tendon get blood through capillary which pa among the muscle fiber when you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow by the time you exert of ymy full power you completely restrict ymy blood flow without fresh blood ymy muscle use store energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generate nasty by-product like lactic acid which cause pain once one muscle hurt all it neighbor tense up perhap to relieve the load thi make sense for ymy normal sort of injury but it only make thing worse with repetitive motion more tension mean le blood flow and the cycle continue another by-product of the lack of blood flow be tingle and numbnes from ymy nerve they need blood too anyway when you type too much you never really give a change for the blood to get back where it belong because ymy muscle never relax enough to let the blood through stres poor posture and poor ergonomic only make thing worse specific injury you may have hear of note most injury come in two flavor acute and chronic acute injury be severely painful and noticable chronic condition have le pronounce symptom but be every bite a real tenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitis occur when the repetitive activity be mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath ability to lubricate the tendon a a result the tendon sheath thicken get inflame and you get ymy problem tendonitis an inflammation of a tendon repeated tense of a tendon can cause inflamation eventually the fiber of the tendon start separate and can even break leave behind debris which induce more friction more swell and more pain sub-acute tendonitis be more common which entail a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tendernes and it get worse with repetitive activity carpal tunnel syndrome the nerve that run through ymy wrist into ymy finger get trap by the inflame muscle around them symptom include feel pin and needle tingle numbnes and even los of sensation ct be often confuse for a diffuse condition adverse mechanical tension also know a tension thi be where the nerve run down to ymy arm have become contract and possibly compress a a result of muscle spasm in the shoulder and elsewhere amt can often misdiagnosed a or associate with one of the other oo disorder it be largely reversible and can be treat with physiotherapy brachial plexu stretch and trigger point therapy other for just about every part of ymy body there a fancy name for a way to injure it by now you should be get an idea of how oo condition occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctor misdiagnose problem a carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem alway get a second opinion before somebody do something drastic to you like surgery typing posture ergonomic prevention treatment the most important element of both prevention and recovery be to reduce tension in the muscle and tendon thi require learn how to relax if you under a load of stres thi be doubly important tune out the world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guide principle in ymy work every three minute take a three second break every three minute take a three second break really do it every three minute it also helpful to work in comfortable surround calm down and relax if you ca sleep you really need to focu on thi rest sleep and relaxation be really a big deal there be all kind of other treatment of course drug can reduce inflamation and pain custom-molded splint can forcefully prevent bad posture surgery can fix some problem exercise can help strengthen ymy muscle regular stretch can help prevent injury good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduce tension ice or hot-cold contrast bath also reduce swell only ymy doctor can say what best for you posture here be some basic guideline i so like the way thi wa write in the new zealand book that i lift it almost verbatim from appendix dwallach let ymy shoulder relax let ymy elbow swing free keep ymy wrist straight pull ymy chin in to look down do flop ymy head forward keep the hollow in the base of ymy spine try lean back in the chair do slouch or slump forward alter ymy posture from time to time every minute get up and bend ymy spine backward set the seat height first ymy foot should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of ymy thigh near the knee and ymy thigh should not slope too much now draw yourself up to ymy desk and see that it height be comfortable to work at if you be short thi may be impossible the beest remedy be to raise the seat height and prevent ymy leg from dangle by use a footrest now adjust the backrest height so that ymy buttock fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you in the hollow of ymy back so adjust it tilt to give firm support in thi area if you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time lean back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available now i diverge a little from the text a good chair make a big difference if you do like ymy chair go find a better one you really want adjustment for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rest seem to get in the way although some more expensive chair have height adjustable arm rest which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a good store and play with all these chair pick one that right for you in the san francisco bay area i highly recommend just chair the name say it all keyboard drawer wrist pad and keyboard replacement there be a fair amount of controvery on how to get thi right for some person wrist pad seem to work wonder however with good posture you should be rest ymy wrist on anything you would prefer ymy keyboard to be right there if you drop ymy arm at ymy side and then lift ymy hand up at the elbow you want ymy keyboard under ymy hand when ymy elbow be at about degree of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all cost wrist pad may or may not help at thi you should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax it often easier for somebody else to notice ymy hunch shoulder or deviate hand some argue that the normal flat keyboard be antiquate and poorly design a number of replacement be available on the market today check out the accompany for much detail request for more info clearly the above information be incomplete the typing-injury archive be incomplete there alway more information out there if you like to submit something please send me mail and i gladly throw it in if you like to maintain a list of product or vendor that would be wonderful i love somebody to make a list of vendor i love somebody to make a list of doctor i love somebody to edit the above section look for
