all who give i have be use wordscan plu for the past couple of week and would like to review the product wordscan plu be a product of calera recognition system it run under window and support that accufont technology of the hewlett packard scanner when initially bring up the software it let you select several option text graphic input source ie scanner fax file disk file automatic versu manual decomposition of the scan image i like manual decomposition since the software then let me select which part of the document i would like scan and in what order once an image be scan you can bring up the pop-up image verification the software gife you two error at thi point blue which be word that be convert reliability but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary yellow shade which be word that wordscan plu do think it convert correctly at all i have find that the software should give itself more credit it be usually correct instead of wrong if a word be shade blue you can add it to ymy personal dictionary the only problem be the personal dictionary will only handle about word i find thi to be very limit consider how many medical term be not in a normal dictionary after a document be convert you can save it in a multitude of word processor format also any image that be capture can be store in a seperate tiff or pcx file format i wa extremely impress on the percent accuracy for fax file i use hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april an intel satisfaxtion card which store incoming fax in a format while most of my faxe be receive in standard mode dpus the accuracy of wordscan plu wa excellent overall a very impressive product the only fault i could find be the limitation of the size of the user dictionary specialize word be just too small if anyone

apple cider also have be implicate preliminary datum from a cdc nationwide multicenter study reveal that when stool be routinely culture for e coli that organism wa isolate more frequently than shigella in fmy of participate hospital and wa isolate from of all bloody stool a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli often be not recognize because most clinical laboratory do not routinely culture stool for thi organism on hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april smac medium and many clinician be unaware of the spectrum of illness associate with infection the usual clinical manifestation be diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramp fever be infrequent younger age group and the elderly be at highest risk for clinical manifestation and complication illnes

community outbreak of e coli in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of thi outbreak the problem may not have be recognize in three state if the epidemiologic link have not be establish in washington clinical laboratory should routinely culture stool specimen from person with bloody diarrhea or hu for e coli use smac agar when infection with e coli be identify they should be report to local health department for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further case e coli life in the intestine of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc be collaborate with the department of agriculture food safety inspection service to identify critical control point in process a a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogen such a e coli enter the meat supply because slaughter practice can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogen and because the proces of grind beef may transfer pathogen from the surface of the meat to the interior grind beef be likely to be internally contaminate the optimal food protection practice be to cook grind beef thoroughly until the interior be no longer pink and the juice be clear in thi outbreak undercooking of hamburger patty likely play an important role the food and drug administration fda ha issue interim recommendation to increase the internal temperature for cook hamburger to f c fda personal communication regulatory action stimulate by the outbreak describe in thi report and the recovery of thousand of contaminate patty before they could be consume
