from sjg susannah gort subject allergy and stuff wa is msg sensitivity superstition unles i plan on get sick i wo eat the stuff without my seldane and do i ever learn to read label it might not please a medical researcher but it please my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine allergy medicine huh is thi just to get rid of the resultant migraine or whatever or do it actually suppres allergic reaction like an antihistamine do a far a doctor over here be concern if you slip up and eat something you allergic to even if they wo test you to tell you what to avoid then tough if a cheap medicine will alleviate ymy symptom then fine otherwise you just suffer one doctor do prescribe me imigran cost the nh for tablet after have to rehydrate me because i be throw up for fmy solid day and could even drink water but i get take off it again when i move and have to change doctor reasoning they do not know what the side-effect be because it wa new ok fine but it ha pass the safety test to get on the prescription list and anyway i wa prepare to take the risk to have quality of life now the only alternative i have be to get it prescribe privately which i can not afford or to pay a private allergy specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid i be fairly certain i be allergic to more than one chemical additive a a lot of thing i ca eat have nothing in common except thing i know be safe so test myself be really an option there be too many permutation i not say i never consume anything with msg i notice that i have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chip once a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chip will bother me if i also have chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the chinese restaurant the day before ye i notice that and i can work it up by eat just under the tolerance level fairly regularly if i do eat anything except home cook for a month or so i lose it and have to work it up from scratch a bad experience now i know what the early-warning symptom be though i can usually tell whether i be allergic to food before i eat too much of it usually
