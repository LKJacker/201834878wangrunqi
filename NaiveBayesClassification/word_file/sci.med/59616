from kenneth gilbert subject re persistent v chronic in article doyle howard r doyle write being a chronic hbsag carrier do not necessarily mean the patient ha chronic persistent anything person who be chronic carrier may have no clinical biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosi or hepatocellular carcinoma most case of chronic persistent hepatitis cph be probably the result of a viral infection although in a good number of case the cause can not be determine the diagnosi of cph be make on the basi of liver biopsy it consist of find of portal inflammation an intact periportal limit plate and on occasion isolate focus of intralobular necrosi but in contrast to chronic active hepatitis cah there be no periportal inflammation bridge necrosi or fibrosi cph ha indeed an excellent prognosi if i have to choose between cah and cph there be no question i would also choose cph however a david point out the distinction between the two be not a neat a some of u would have it the histology can sometime be pretty equivocal with biopsy show area compatible with both cph and cah maybe it be a sample problem maybe it be a continuum i do know darn just when i think i understand something someone who know the pathology ha to burst my bubble we better not start talk about glomerular disease then i really get depress seriously though i wonder how someone with cph would end up get a biopsy in the first place my understand and feel free to correct me be that the enzyme be at worst mildly elevate with overall normal hepatic function i would think that the only clue might be a history of prior hepb infection and a positive hepb-sag or be it indeed on a continuum with cah and the distinction merely one of pathology and prognosi but otherwise identical clinical feature kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh general internal medicine dammit not a programmer
