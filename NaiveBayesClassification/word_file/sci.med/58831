from turner havok impersonate subject re is msg sensitivity superstition in article carl write in article write surprise surprise different person react differently to different thing one slightly off the subject case in point my brother get sting by a bee i know he be allergic to bee sting but that hi reaction be severe localize swell not anaphylactic shock i could not convince the doctor of that however because that not write in their little rule book of course bee venom be a single chemical could be ymy brother be react to a different component than the one that cause anaphylactic shock in other person hmmm the last time i get sting by a bee i experience the same reaction the first poster brother do we go off to the doctor to see if i should worry about the fact that my foot wa now about time it normal size and itch ow he basically say i should thi time but that bee sting allergy wa not something you tend to get aclimatized to but be something that each time get progressively worse generally and that next time could be the time i go into anaphylactic shock admittedly thi wa many year ago when i wa young since then i just make sure i do get sting i also should carry a bee sting kit with me but i do thi be scientific or proof but thi would lead me to believe it not a different reaction just a different degree of reaction allergy work that way person have variou reaction sort of like diabetes some person can get by with just monitor their diet other have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometime while other have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly i think msg be probably similar some person have allergic reaction to it some person be allergic to ferment thing and ca use soy sauce but the chinese have be use it for century that do necessarily mean that it safe for everyone johanna turner
