from heart g subject cholistasi sp fat-free hi i just return from a visit with my and i have a few concern that maybe can help me with i be see her every week for the past few month i at week and during the last visit i gain to pound every week she say thi wa unacceptable over any week period a it stand i thu far gain pound also she say that though i at week the baby size be week i think she mention inch for the top of the fundu when i wa week the baby size wa week i must also add that i have an operation a few year ago for endometriosi and i have no problem with endometriosi but apparently it be cause me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time move and the doc ha recommend i not walk or move unles i have to i have a little handicap sticker for when i do need to go out anyway that of the situation the other be that almost from the begin of pregnancy i wa get sick throw up about time a day and mostly it wa bile that wa be eliminate i tell her about thi i know thi because i wa eat very much due to the nausea and could see the well now i only get sick about once every week and it be still bile relate but in addition i have begin to feel movement near my upper right abdoman just below the right breast usually when i wa lie on my right side it begin to get worse though because it start to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i wa in next i notice that when i eat greasy or fatty food i felt like my entire abdoman have turn to stone and the pain in the area get worse however if i eat sauerkraut or vinegar or something to the fat it wa a much of a problem so the doctor say i have cholistati and that i should avoid fatty food thi make sense and because i wa already aware of what seem to me thi cause and effect relationship i have be avoid these food on my own but i still able to eat food with ricottum cheese for instance and other low fat food but doc want me to be on a non-fat diet thi mean no meat except fish and chicken skin i do thi anyway no nut fry food cheese etc i be allow skim milk she say i should avoid anything sweet banana also i must only have one serve of something high in carbohydrate a day potato pastum rice she say i ca even cook vegetable in a little bite of oil and that i should eat vegetable raw or steam i concern because i understand you need to have some fat in ymy diet to help in the digestive proces and if i not take in fat be she expect the baby will take it from my store and why thi restriction on carbohydrate if she concern about fat i not clear how much of her recommendation be base on my weight gain and how much on cholistati which i ca seem to find any information on she originally say that i should only gain pound during the entire pregnancy since i wa about lb overweight when i start but my sister gain lb during her pregnancy and she take it all off and ha have any problem she also ask if any member of my family be obese which none of them be anyway i think she be overly concern about weight gain and feel like i be by a severe diet she do want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know be how reasonable be thi non-fat diet i would understand if she have say low-fat diet since i try that anyway even if she say really low-fat diet i think she assume i must be eat a high-fat diet but really it be that because of the endometriosi and the operation i not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinion info and experience will be appreciate i truly go stark rave mad try to meet thi new strict diet because fruit and vegetable go through my system in a few minute and i end up have to eat constantly thu far i do find any food satisfy thank g
