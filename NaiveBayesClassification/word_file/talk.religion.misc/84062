from turpin russell turpin subject history text wa ancient reference to christianity in article cobb mike cobb write why be the nt toss out a info on jesu i realize it be normally toss out because it contain miracle but what be the other reason far from be toss out the gospel be take almost universally a the primary source of information about jesu i be curiou a to whom mike cobb be refer who toss out the new testament undoubtedly a few naive atheist do thi but the phrase of the question above seem to suggest that cobb ascribe thi more broadly perhap the question that get more to the heart of the matter be why except for some naive believer who unfortunately far outnumber nonbeliever both naive and critical be the gospel not take a gospel truth that faithfully record just what happen two thousand year ago thi ha an easy answer and the answer ha nothing to do with miracle no text be take thi way by a critical reader there be a myth among some naive believer that one take a text measure it by some set of criterium and then either confirm the text a historically valid or toss out the text i suspect thi myth come from the way history be present in primary and secondary school where certain text be vest with authority and from writer such a josh mcdowell who pretend to present historical argument along these line for their religiou program in fact most text use in primary and secondary school history class ought to be toss out even the better such text should not be treat a authoritatively a descibed above and josh mcdowell would not know a historical argument if it bite him on the keister twice let me present the barest outline of a different view of text and their use in study history first all text be historically valid all text or to put thi another way i have never see a notion of historical validity that make any sense when apply to a text second no text should be read a tell the gospel truth about historical event in the way that many student be wont to read history text in primary and secondary school no text thi include ymy favorite author history of whatever every text be a historical fact every text wa write by some person or some group of person for some purpose hence every text can serve a historical evidence the question be what can we learn from a text of what interest thing if any do the text provide evidence the diary of the follower of the maharishi formerly of oregon be historical evidence the gospel be historical evidence the letter of the officer who participate in the vampire inquest in eastern europe be historical evidence the modern american history textbook that whitewash great american figure be historical evidence these be all historical evidence of variou thing they be not much evidence at all that the maharishi formerly of oregon could levitate that jesu wa resurrect that vampire exist or that great american figure be a squeaky clean a we learn in school they be better evidence that some person saw the maharishi late of oregon levitate that some of the early christian think jesu wa resurrect that many person in eastern europe saw vampire return from the grave and that we still have an educational system that largely prefer to spread myth rather than teach history how do one draw causal connection and infer what a piece of historical evidence text or otherwise evince thi be a very complex question that ha no easily summarize answer there be many book on the subject or variou part of the subject i enjoy david hackett fischer historian fallacy a a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it be so easy to read text present history it relatively cheap it easy to read give it a try russell
