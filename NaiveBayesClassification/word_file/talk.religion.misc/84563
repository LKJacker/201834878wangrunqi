from sbuckley stephen buckley subject re what right joakimr joakim ruud write recently i ask myself a rather interest question what right do god have on my life alway assume there be a god of course in hi infinite wisdom he make it perfectly clear that if we do live accord to hi rule we will burn in hell well with what right can god make that desicion let say for the sake of argument that god create every one of u directly or indirectly it do matter what then happen be that he first create u and then turn u lose well i do ask to be create i gues i ought not conclude from thi then that since you do ask to be create you do care if you go to hell let make an analogue if a scientist create a unique live creature which ha happen it wa even patent do he then have the right to expect it to behave in a certain matter or die who be god to impose it rule on u who can tell if god be really so righteou a god like u to believe are all christian a flock of sheep unable to do otherwise that follow the rest i do consider myself an unthinking sheep the bible say god create u to be in communion and obedience to him the first and only rule wa to not eat of a certain tree or else the punishment be distance from him and physical death god intention in create u be to have a relationship with u the bible document god attempt to have that relationship culminate in the person of jesu to bear the consequence of all sin so that all who accept him can have a relationship with god again the purpose of creation who be god to impose rule on u he god and he create u i suppose he ha a right base on who he be above you mention in hi infinite wisdom and that what i say god exemplify but if you be be sarcastic up there then thi whole discussion be irrelevant eh and if we believe god be infinitely wise that belief should inform my relationship with him
