from mcelwre subject the divine master the divine master most christian would agree and correctly so that jesu christ wa a divine master and a projection of god into the physical world god incarnate but there be some very important relate fact that christian be completely ignorant of a be follower of most other world religion first jesu christ wa not unique john notwith standing there be alway at least one such divine master god incarnate physically alive in thi world at all time a continuou succession throughout history both before and after the life of jesu the follower of some of these master found the world major religion usually perverting the teach of their master in the proces christian for example add threat of eternal damnation in hell and deleted the teach of reincarnation secondly and more importantly after a particular master physically dy and leaf thi world there be nothing that he can do for anybody except for the relatively few person that he initiated while he wa still physically alive that is simply the way god set thing up in the universe therefore all those christian who worship jesu and pray to jesu and expect jesu to return and save them from their sin be only kidding themself and have allow themself to be duped by a religion that wa mostly manufactured by the roman and emotional feel be a totally deceiving indicator for religiou validity these thing be similarly true for follower of most other major world religion include islam thirdly the primary function of each master be to tune hi initiate into the audible life stream or sound current refer to a the word in john and a the river of life in revelation and to personally guide each of them thru the upper level of heaven while they be still connect to their live physical body by a silver cord true salvation which complete a soul cycle of reincarnation in the physical and psychic plane be achieve only by reach at least the soul plane which be five level or universe above the physical universe and thi can not be do without the help of a physically-living divine master one such divine master alive today be an american srus harold klemp the living eck master or mahantum for the eckankar organization now headquarter in minneapoli box zip another divine master be maharaj gurinder singh ji now live in punjab indium and be associate with the sant mat organization one of the classic book on thi subject be the path of the master radha soami book box gardena ca write in by dr julian johnson a theologian and surgeon who spend the last year of hi life in indium study under and closely observe the sant mat master of that time maharaj sawan singh ji several of the eckankar book include some author by srus paul twitchell or srus harold klemp can be find in most public and university library and some book store or obtain thru inter-library loan the book eckankar the key to secret world by srus paul twitchell be another classic many christian be likely to confuse the master with the anti-christ which be or wa to be a temporary world dictator during the so-called last day but the master do ever rule even when ask or expect to do so a jesu wa person who continue follow christianity islam or other orthodox religion with a physically-dead master will continue on their cycle of reincarnation between the psychic plane and thi miserable physical world until they finally accept initiation from a physically-living divine master re-incarnation the book here and hereafter by ruth montgomery describe several kind of evidence support reincarnation a a fact of life include hypnotic regression to past life about accurate the subconsciou mind sometime make thing up especially with a bad hypnotist spontaneou recall especially by young child some of whom can identify their most recent previou relative home possession etc dream recall of past life experus ence deja vu familiarity with a far off land while travel ing there for the first time on vacation the psychic read ings of the late edgar cayce and even supporting statement from the christian bible include matthew john the baptist wa the reincarnation of elia and john how can a person possibly sin before he be bear unles he lived before alway use the king jame version later version be per-version strong interest innate talent strong phobia etc typically originate from a person past life for example a strong fear of swim in or travel over water usually result from have drowned at the end of a previou life and sometime a person will take an immediate dislike to another person be meet for the first time in thi life because of a bad encounter with him during a previou incarnation the teach of reincarnation also include the law of karma galatian revelation etc person would behave much better toward each other if they know that their action in the present will surely be reap by them in the future or in a future incarnation coming if a divine master physically dy translate before a particular initiate of hi do then when that initiate physically dy translate the master will meet him on the astral level and take him directly to the soul plane thi be the one and only correct mean of a coming it be an individual experience not something that happen for everyone all at once person who be still wait for jesu coming be waiting in vain plane of existence the physical universe be the lowest of at least a dozen major level of existence above the physical plane be the astral plane the causal plane the mental plane the etheric plane often count a the upper part of the mental plane the soul plane and several higher spiritual plane the soul plane be the first true heaven count upward from the physical the plane between but not include the physical and soul plane be call the psychic plane it be likely that esp telepathy astrological influence radionic effect biological transmutation see the book with that title and other phenomenon without an apparent physical origin result from interaction between the psychic plane and the physical plane the major plane be also sub-divided for example a sub-plane of the astral plane be call hade and the christian hell occupy a small part of it create there les than year ago by the early catholic church by some kind of black magic or by simply teach it existence in a threatening manner the christian heaven be locate elsewhere on the astral plane good christian will go there for a short while and then reincarnate back to earth sound current v blind faith the christian religion demand of it follower an extraordinary amount of blind faith back up by little more than good feeling which be totally deceiving if a person be not hearing some form of the sound current the word the bani the audible life stream then hi cycle of reincarnation in thi miserable world will continue the sound current manifest differently for different initiate and can sound like a rush wind ocean wave on the sea shore buzz bee higher-pitched buzz sound a flute variou heavenly music or other sound in eckankar member start hear it near the end of their first year a a member thi and other experience such a soul travel
