from psyrobtw robert weis subject ld rick reply rick anderson reply to my letter with ra in article ra psyrobtw robert weis say ra ra well jason it heretical in a few way the first point be that ra thi equate lucifer and jesu a be the same type of be ra however lucifer be a create be thou wast perfect in thy ra way from the day that thou wast create till iniquity wa find in ra thee ezekiel while jesu be uncreated and the creator of ra all thing in the begin wa the word and the word wa with ra god and the word wa god the same wa in the begin with god ra all thing be make by him and without him wa not any thing make ra that wa make john and he be before all thing and by ra him all thing consist colossian ra ra ymy inference from the ezekiel and john passage that lucifer wa ra create and that jesu wa not depend on a particular interpetation of ra the word create one with which many christian may not agree ra granted the mormon belief that all of god child include christ ra and lucifer be eternally existent intelligence which be organize ra into spirit child by god the term creation can apply equally well ra to both of those passage just briefly on something that you mention in pass you refer to differ interpretation of create and say that many christian may not agree so what that be really irrelevant we do not base my faith on how many person think one way or another do we the bottom line be truth regardles of popularity of opinion also i find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create and eternally existent be equivalent you say grant the mormon belief you ca grant ymy conclusion and then expect the point to have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to addres and answer the point that wa raise and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant the bible state that lucifer wa create the bible state that jesu be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the ld belief be that jesu and lucifer be the same ra ymy point that we all be brother of jesu and lucifer be also ra heretical since we be not innately brother and sister of christ ra we be adopt for ye have not receive the spirit of bondage ra again to fear but ye have receive the spirit of adoption whereby ra we cry abba father roman and not the natural child ra of god it be only through faith that we even enter the family of ra god for ye be all the child of god by faith in christ jesu ra galatian and it be only through the manifestation of thi ra faith in receive jesu that we be become the son of god but ra a many a receive him to them give he power to become the son of ra god even to them that believe on hi name which be bear not ra of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but ra of god john ra ra ha it occur to you robert that be bear of someone or be ra of that person or person family may be a symbolic term in the new ra testament mormon believe that we be adopt into the house of ra israel through baptism and faith in christ although some have express ra belief that thi do evince a physical change in my body the mormon belief be that all be child of god literally there be nothing symbolic about it thi however contradict what the bible say the bible teach that not everyone be a child of god the field be the world the good seed be the child of the kingdom but the tare be the child of the wicked one matthew i speak that which i have see with my father and ye do that which ye have see with ymy father john ye do the deed of ymy father then say they to him we be not bear of fornication we have one father even god jesu say unto them if god be ymy father ye would love me for i proceed forth and come from god neither come i of myself but he send me why do ye not understand my speech even because ye can not hear my word ye be of ymy father the devil and the lust of ymy father ye will do he wa a murderer from the begin and abide not in the truth because there be no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of hi own for he be a liar and the father of it john and say o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousnes wilt thou not cease to pervert the right way of the lord act wherein in time past ye walk accord to the course of thi world accord to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the child of disobedience ephesian in thi the child of god be manifest and the child of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousnes be not of god neither he that loveth not hi brother john one become a child of god but a many a receive him to them give he power to become the son of god even to them that believe on hi name john behold what manner of love the father hath bestow upon u that we should be call the son of god therefore the world knoweth u not because it know him not beloved now be we the son of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him a he be john when he be bear again through faith in jesu christ which be bear not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god john having predestinate u unto the adoption of child by jesu christ to himself accord to the good pleasure of hi will ephesian of hi own will beget he u with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruit of hi creature jame for a many a be lead by the spirit of god they be the son of god for ye have not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witnes with my spirit that we be the child of god roman beloved let u love one another for love be of god and every one that loveth be bear of god and knoweth god john whosoever believeth that jesu be the christ be bear of god and every one that loveth him that beget loveth him also that be beget of him john for ye be all the child of god by faith in christ jesu galatian ra we be tell that and thi be life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesu christ whom thou hast send ra john life eternal be to know the only true god yet the ra doctrine of the ld that i have mention portray a vastly ra different jesu a jesu that can not be reconcile with the jesu of ra the bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim ra one a be true deny the other from be true according to the ra bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination ra ra ra robert with all due respect who die and leave you chief arbiter of ra correct biblical interpretation i do mean to be snotty about thi ra but the fact be that the bible be so differently interpret by different ra group of biblical scholar what do you think of the jehovah ra witness for example that to make reference to the jesu of the ra bible be simply ridiculou whose jesu of the bible do you mean thi be really a red herring it do addres any issue raise but rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read something into the bible do change what the bible teach for example the fact that the jehovah witness deny the deity of christ do not alter what the bible teach looking for that bless hope and the gloriou appear of the great god and my savimy jesu christ titu simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesu christ to them that have obtain like preciou faith with u through the righteousnes of god and my savimy jesu christ peter on the deity of christ we first look to the bible to see what it teach to discount or not even addres what the bible teach because there be some group that have differ view be self-defeating to see what the bible teach you have to look at the bible ra my lord mortality wa essential to hi own salvation the ra promised messiah p he have to work out hi own salvation by ra do the will of the father in all thing ibid he have ra to be baptize to gain admission to the celestial kingdom mormon ra doctrine ra ra welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine robert the ra above book be by the late bruce r mcconkie a former general authority ra of the ld church those book be not publish by the church nor do ra they constitute offical doctrine they consist of hi opinion now ra do that mean that what he say be not true not at all i have to ra think about the idea of christ personal salvation before i come to any ra conclusion myself the conclusion i come to may seem heretical to ra you but i prepare to accept that i find thi rather curiou when i mention that the mormon belief be that jesu need to be save i put forward some quote from the late apostle bruce mcconkie the curiou part be that no one address the issue of jesu need to be save rick come the closest with hi i have my own conclusion to address the point most of the other reply have instead hop-scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether hi view be doctrine i do think that it matter if mcconkie view be canon that be not the issue were mcconkie write indicative of mormon belief on thi subject be the real issue the indication from rick be that they may certainly be robert weis psyrobtw
