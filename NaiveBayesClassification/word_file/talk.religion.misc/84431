from bil bill conner subject re after year can we say that christian morality be in my mind to say that science ha it basi in value be a bite of a reach science ha it basi in observable fact i say that what one choose to observe and how the observation be interpret and what significance it give depend a great deal on the value of the observer science be a human activity and a such be subject to the same potential for distortion a any other human activity the myth that scientist be above moral influence or ethical concern that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the bias of the scientist be nonsense bill if one be to argue for objective value in a moral sense then one must first start by demonstrate that morality itself be objective considering the mean of the word objective i doubt that thi will ever happen so back to the original question and objective morality be thi may be an unfortunate choice of word almost self-contradictory objective in the sense use here mean something immutable and absolute while morality describe the behavior of some group of person the first term be all inclusive the second be specific the concept supposedly describe may have mean however if there be a god a describe by the christian for instance then he ha existence apart from and independent of humankind hi existence be outside of my frame of reference reality if thi be declare a thing to be so it be necessarily so since he ha define himself a omnipotent and if hi claim be to be believe he be at least omnipotent relative to u god be intrinsically self-defined and all reality be whatever he say it be in an objective sense if god determine a standard of conduct that standard be objective if human be be hold accountable for their conformance to that standard while permit to ignore it they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct give the term morality a nebulou meaningles sense that can be argue about by those pretend to misunderstand the standard be objective and the conduct require to meet that standard be therefore objectively determine just because it be convenient to pretend that the term morality be infinitely malleable do mean that the objective standard itself do exist morality ha come to mean little more than a cultural norm or the prefer conduct of decent person make it seem subjective but it be derive from an absolute objective standard ironically thi objective standard be in perfect accord with my true nature accord to christianity at least yet be condemn a be contrary to human nre oppressive and severe thi may be due a bill much to my amoral inclination a to the standard itself but like it or not it
