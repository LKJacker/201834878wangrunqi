from brian brian ceccarelli subject re is it good that jesu die brian kendig first state i be my own master i ask are you truly the master of yourself brian kendig state not yet make up ymy mind but my life be the grind i use to practice on the fun be in the get there we do start out perfect and we do not end perfect either we be never perfect can you name one person young or old past or present that you deem perfect good luck i know my shortcoming and i know my strength and i live my life accord to the decision i make and i be content to abide with the consequence of my decision a easily a i accept the praise for them there have be time in my life when i make mistake ye i try to never make the same mistake twice then you lie to yourself you do not know ymy shortcoming i have clearly show one of ymy shortcoming if not two that be ignorance of the bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butcher it without even know it content i regard christ a a myth because you have be too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself and to demonstate ymy lack of support for ymy conclusion i bet you do not even know what the word christ mean or which prophet use christ to describe the son of man i feel that there be far too many person offer far too many interpretation of what he supposedly say and do the only person who can really judge me be me ye i agree with that so we must learn first read the bible come up with my own interpretation evaluate what be be say and by whom check the history book a well compare someone else interpretation with ymy own then make a judgment but i tell you the truth of what be be say in the bible need interpretation a much a a coffee cup need interpretation and remember the bible be a guru esoteric guide to metaphysic it do take a theologian to understand what be be say the bible be a bunch of testimoney from person like you and i address to person like you and i these guy write down what they saw and hear is it their open diary and they want to tell you something and because they want you to know something they make it very clear what they want you to know they do encouch their idea in esoteric rhetoric but in simple straight-forward language i choose the road i travel and i decide whether or not i want to reach the end of any give road or turn back and a long a i do alway turn back there no shame in it when i need help i seek out my friend you have choose the road that avoid the bible you have choose the road that avoid a confrontation with the live god because that road do look appeal to you you rather build ymy own road one that go far away from that confrontation but be assure of thi you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly and you do have a clue about what i say either open ymy eye and see open ymy ear and listen i not just spout off empty word thi be my life thi be what gife me meaning i see what you mean i hear what ymy say i be not degrade ymy life but i have hear the same irrational excuse for year there be nothing new in what you be say and by ymy own word you be spout off contradiction if contradiction give you mean then ymy life must be sad i say my mother love me how do i know you ask i can point to definite thing she do for me and i can even just bring her to you so you can ask her face-to-face you say ymy deity love you how do you know i ask bingo for god so love the world he gave hi only begotton to son so that whososever belife in him will have ever last life i look what god do he ha give hi son even to hi death so that i can have hope in hi resurrection and know that life be for nothing but ha gloriou purpose you ca even convince me that it exist because you turn ymy eye away from testimony and history you choose to lie to yourself that he do exist for you ignore what ha be say for thousand of year you sound exactly almost verbatim like the lazaru of jesu story start in luke and the conclusion of that story be a bleak one lazaru wind up in hell the story end like thi for if lazaru do even listen to mosis and the prophet he wo even believe if a man rise from the dead if any god dangle before me like a carrot promise untold pleasure to me if i only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just thi once then i would choose i can not lie to myself to placate another be no matter how powerful it be arrogance at it best the fact be you be not rational several specific case have already be cite and again with thi new statement you show more irrationality with regard to heaven jesu do tell you something of what to expect in heaven jesu expect you to use ymy brain to believe in him jesu do not expect you to placate either jesu want you to willingly come to him but not a hi grovel slave but rather a hi brother who will share in hi gloriou rich why do you not pick up the bible and read it for yourself you maintain you have an open mind see whether you be lie to yourself for yourself why would you want to live a good life to you you die and that it do contradict yourself you have no reason to live a good life it do do you any good in the end ymy life do do anybody else any good either because everyone dy anyway so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life be meaningles why do you do such a meaningles thing that paragraph demonstrate that you have listen to a single word i say i do understand what you say but that be not what i feel go amis here you miss the point living a good life ha no eternal consequence once they close the amusement park of life to you that be the end to you it be over to you therefore ymy time spend in the amusement park be meaningles it ha no eternal consequence to you nor to anyone leave on earth but then you contradict yourself from a previou post you say do evil thing be bad to you it should matter if you do evil thing or good thing it be all meaningles in the end anyway so go rob a bank go tell someone you dislike that he be a dirty rotten slime bag what restrain you life after all ha no eternal consequence and accountability be irrelevant in the same way i think life be fun and i do intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night d at which time you be truly not the master of yourself i sorry i do feel that sacrifice jesu wa something any god i worship would do unles the sacrifice wa only temporary in which case it not really all that important ha the resurrection sink in jesu be alive jesu be not dead so you and ymy holy book say by the same token therefore santum clau deliver toy every xma do you see i have no reason to believe that what you say be true please give me some reason that i ca similarly apply to santum clau you have every reason to believe that what jesu say and the witness of jesu say be true but you choose to be unreasonable and ignore the reason by definition ignorance santum clau be say to live at the north pole and have a squad of elf and fly reindeer ever see a fly reindeer ha anyone in human history see a fly reindeer ha anyone see a reindeer whose nose blink red on the other hand be person bear in bethlehem wa nebuchandezzar really a king wa daniel really one of hi court official were david and solomon really king of israel and judah wa their really a king call jehoachin did sennecherib really attack jerusalem year before christ did sennacherib really lose hi battle and badly wa there really a caiapha who interrogate jesu ye ye ye history verify it it be nonfiction do you have a problem discern truth from fiction perhap you ca evaluate the context of grimm fairy tale apart from that of the scientific american i suppose you treat both with equal truthfulnes or equal falsity is thi what you be tell me or be it that just do want to read the scientific american and find out that it not a fairy tale are you thereby infer that ymy deity be nothing more than a collection of verse in a book and can not be support without invoke them get real have you ever be to zaire do you have to go there to be assure that there really be such a place given ymy irrationality i take it you have never use a map in ymy life why do you believe what you believe given the overwhelm evidence a well a my personal experience with the live god i be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if i do follow jesu
