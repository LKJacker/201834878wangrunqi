from rob lanphier subject re a kind and loving god malcolm lee mlee write i will clarify my earlier quote god law be originally write for the israelite jesu change that fact by now make the law applicable to all person not just the jew gentile could be part of the kingdom of heaven through the save grace of god i never say that the law wa make obsolete by jesu just for reference here the earlier quote malcolm lee mlee write in reference to leviticu and deuteronomy these law write for the israelite god choose person whom god have expressly set apart from the rest of the world the israelite be a direct witnes to god existence to disobey god after knowing that god be real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable remember these law be write for a different time and apply only to god choose person but jesu ha change all of that we be live in the age of grace sin be no longer immediately punishable by death there be repentance and there be salvation through my lord jesu christ and not just for a few choose person salvation be available to everyone jew and gentile alike these be two conflict statement to say one be a clarification of the other be a breach of logic i do mind person shift their position on an issue it irritate me when it be say under the premise that no change wa make what about deuteronomy is it wrong now did jesu change that if anything he clarify the law such a in that quote you make in the follow verse jesu take several portion of the law and expound upon the law give clearer mean to what god intend sure he do thi however he do addres the notion of stone non-virgin bride because thi need no clarification are you go to deny that deuteronomy be not patently clear in it intent i think you will agree with me that there be in today world a lot of modern-day pharisee who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it what good be head knowledge if there be nothing in the heart i agree that there be a lot of modern day pharisee that know the bible from end to end and do believe in it depending on how they use thi knowledge they can be scary they can argue any position they desire and back it up with select part of the bible such pharisee include david koresh and adolph hitler i will qualify thi by say i do know if they actually believe what they be preach but the end certainly make the mean look frighten however just a scary be those that do know much of the bible but believe every word in fact thi be probably scarier since there be far more of these person from what i see in addition they be very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned pharisee since they do know enough to debate with these person christianity be not just a set of rule it a lifestyle that change one perspective and personal conduct and it demand obedience to god will no it demand obedience to a book if god come down and personally tell me how i should behave then i would say that i would be do god will by do it however if preacher pastor and evangelist tell me to obey the will of a book write by person who have be dead for close to two millenium even longer for the ot even if i follow everything in it with my heart i could scarcely be honest with myself by say i do the will of god some person can live by it but many other can not or will not that be their choice and i have to respect it because god respect it too well if god respect it so much how come there be talk in the bible about eternal damnation for non-believer i see little respect eminating from the god of the bible i see a selfish and spiteful god god be with you not your thank malcolm lee rob lanphier and for the curiou here be my earlier post hmm for a book that only apply to the israelite deuteronomy jesu sure quote it a lot mt in addition he allude to it in several other place mt mk jn and just in case it be clear jesu think the old testament be obsolete i repeat the verse in matthew which get quote on thi group a lot do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophet i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them i tell you the truth until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any mean disappear from the law until everything be accomplish anyone who break one of the least of these commandment and teach other to do the same will be call least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever practice and teach these command will be call great in the kingdom of heaven for i tell you that unles ymy righteousnes surpass that of the pharisee and the teacher of the law you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven mt niv in pretty red letter so that you know it jesu talk thi cause a seriou dilemma for christian who think the old testament do apply to them i think that why paul harvey like quote it so much
