from david david bold subject re question for those with popular morality paul hudson jr hudson write i wa not directly go to come up with a moral argument for the existence of god rather i wa try to show the absurdity of atheistic materialist relatavist try to embrace some common moral system a though it be absolute man know in hi heart that there be right and wrong we have all inherit thi knowledge no matter how absurd it be to suggest that a common moral system create by mankind be absolute it be not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system create by mankind be sensible in fact for the bible to be of any use to mankind a a moral code it must be interpret by mankind and a workable moral system create for everyday use the jewish talmud be the result of century of biblical scholar analyse every word of the torah to understand the morality behind it the child of israel be give a very strict set of moral civil judicial and ceremonial law to follow and yet thi wa clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their society for a christian the situation be no better it seem to me that the only code of morality that we have from the judeo christian god be that which be contain in the bible which we can see from the diverse opinion in the christian newsgroup be not clear there may well be an absolute morality define by the judeo-christian god for mankind to follow but it seem that we only have a subset simply because the concept wa write down by man thi lead to the problem of define morality for my society if we take the divine morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpret in many different way a an example consider the immolation of heretic in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the bible which allow a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer justice if we take an agnostic morality then we have a code of practice that can be modify to suit society with all the danger that thi imply alternatively we could take the basi of the judeo-christian morality and thi to create and justify a code of morality which suit the society we live in and enable the person to live righteously a many christian and non-christian philosopher have do whatever the drive force behind the definition of morality for my society i think the important aspect be the result david on religion oh where be the sea the fish cry a they swim it clearnes through
