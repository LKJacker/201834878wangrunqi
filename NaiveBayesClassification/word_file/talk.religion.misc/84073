from brian brian ceccarelli subject re is it good that jesu die in article bskendig brian kendig write john most assuredly i say to you unles a grain of wheat fall onto the grind and dy it remain alone but if it dy it produce much grain he who love hi life will lose it and he who hate hi life in thi world will keep it for eternal life if anyone serve me let him follow me and where i be there my servant will be also if anyone serve me him my father will honor why would i want an eternal life if i hate thi one again you miss jesu point if you read the surround passage you would understand what jesu mean by life in the world but a be you bumble around assert ymy standard axiom that the bible be bunk and come up with the wrong idea also you do not know exactly what jesu mean by eternal life brian k do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanic book and understand hermite polynomial have not read the surround material why do you such with the bible for an idea what jesu mean by the world look up reference to it in ymy concordance for a good description the whole book of ecclesiaste be game for eternal life check out john john you will find that eternal life be quite different than what you think eternal life start now an infinitely high quality of life live in fellowship with god in short even if ymy deity do exist that do automatically mean that i would worship it i be content to live my own life and fend for myself so when i die i can be proud of the fact that no matter where i end up it will be because of my action and my choice if ymy god decide to tos me into a flame pit for thi then so be it i would much rather just cease to exist but if ymy god want my respect and my obedience then it have better earn these and if it do then they will be very strong and true if my diety exist you would not just cease to exist jesu talk of hell in luke you get to understand my point-of-view i see christian spout bible verse all the time a if it be some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition truth be it not robert ha never demonstrate that he actually understand what the verse imply he just rattle them off day by day some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality and i point these out where i can the truth be be that it be not some sort of magic spell the truth be be that you do not understand it and enjoy not understand it christanity be a very nice belief set around a very nice book wrong again christianity be suppose to be relationship you do not even know what christianity be and you be argue against it and in my opinion you bumble about blindly make up entity where there be any and deprive yourself of a true understand and enjoyment of ymy life a long a you keep ymy belief to yourself i keep my belief to myself but a soon a you start wave them around expect me to tos in my opinion too just a i make up such place a jericho jerusalem babylon corinth ephesu susa and such king a nebuchanezzar david solomon sennacherib herod pontiu pilate but i gues then that you treat abraham lincoln a a myth like you do odin and zeu
