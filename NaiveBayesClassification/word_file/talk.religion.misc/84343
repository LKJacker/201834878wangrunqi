from mathew mathew subject what about when there complete disagreement wa re after stuff there be actually some relate comment below believe it or not frank frank write in article mathew mathew mant write frank frank write specifically i like to know what relativism conclude when two person grotesquely disagree is it a both be right b one of them be wrong and sometime though perhap rarely we have a pretty good idea who it be c one of them be wrong but we never have any information a to who so we make my best gues if we really must make a decision d the idea of a right moral judgement be meaningles imply that whether peace be better than war be a meaningles question and need not be discuss for it ha no correct answer e something else a short positive assertion would be nice from whose point of view would you like to know what relativism conclude one of the person involve in the argument or some third person observe the arguer i just come from respond another of ymy post where some penny have drop for me but it would clarify further if you would answer from the point of view of any disinterested observer perhap an observer a likely to be in position a a in position b where a and b disagree in the future and have hi or her conclusion now bind on them at that time well if my observer x be a likely to be in a position a b and if he agree that both a and b be make appropriate observation and inference regard the situation then i would expect him to conclude that there be no right answer hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow him to make some judgement regard which answer to accept if on the other hand he disagree with the principle of either a or b i suspect he would make a decision in favmy of the other one it be unfortunately the case that not all moral argument have answer from all perspective for instance i be completely unable to come to any conclusion regard whether abortion should be allow or not from my perspective in an ideal world all live thing would have a right to life but in an ideal world woman would have the absolute right to do what they like with their own body clearly there be no way to resolve in favmy of both these principle therefore i agree with the compromise solution of allow abortion up to a certain time after conception and decide on the time base on variou sometime ill-defined criterium thi be also a sensible move i think because it let person make their own decision within reason and for what it worth i be reasonably happy with current uk abortion law similarly the situation in what leave of yugoslavium be a horrible me and i really ca see my way to any sort of conclusion there i do even know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage mathew
