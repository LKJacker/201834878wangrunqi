from daveb dave butler subject re new biblical contradiction still not answered juda mr decenso in spite of require scholarly opinion on the hang of juda reject that the scholarly opinion of the those scholar and then rephrase those scholar opinion on the subject we do know from matthew that he do hang himself and act probably record hi death although it possible and plausible that he fell from the hang and hit some rock thereby burst open i can no longer assume that to be the case therefore no contradiction matthew do not say juda die a a result of the hang do he most scholar believe he iprobably do but i quote all that to show that i highly regard the scholar explanation but in look at the text initially we ca assume juda die it be however highly probable and also there be nothing in the greek to suggest succes or failure it simply mean hang oneself actually if you do further research a to the greek word apacgw you will find that it do denote succes those scholar do indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide wa successful a i point out i recently check several lexicon greek english lexicon of the new testament louw and nida robinson greek and english lexicon of the new testament greek english lexicon of the new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other early christian writing bauer-arndt-gingrich the new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher a couple simply state hang oneself and a couple be more explicit and state that apacgw mean specifically kill yourself by hang a couple also note that the mean of one the root word for apacgw be strangle throttle or choke which pretty much invalidate the guy who suggest to david joslin that juda wa hang upside down one of the best reference though robinson greek and english lexicon of the new testament not only state the translation it give both the root word the literal translation relate greek word which use the same root and also other present specific example of the word in greek literature to give further context the word apagchw ha two root word gchw be the to strangle root and the root word apo mean literally away thi root word be include in word which denote a transition it can mean a transition in place eg the greek word apagello mean to send a message apo can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death robinson specifically make comparison to the word apokteiuo which mean to kill in literal mean the word apacgw mean to throttle strangle to put out of the way and implicitly denote a change in life state ie away from life to death so while the word apacgw do mean to hang it specifically denote a death a well thu robinson be quite specific when he state that it mean to hang oneself to end one life by hang he then note the the use of apacgw in homer odessy to denote context he present that example of apacgw a be use to explicitly mean suicide by hang now since there be a perfectly good word for strangle without the add denotation of death and a you insist that the bible wa write by god and every word be precicely correct you be stick with the complete mean of apacgw ie since the word apacgw wa use then death be denote a the result by the way i note that mr decenso also present an example of apacgw in the septuagint the greek translation of the ot use at the time of jesu it only use in samuel now when ahithophel saw that hi advice wa not follow he saddle a donkey and arise and go home to hi house to hi city then he put hi household in order and hang himself and die and he wa bury in hi father tomb notice that not only be it state that ahithophel hang himself gr sept apagcho but it explicitly add and die here we have no doubt of the result in matthew we be not explicitly tell juda die note mr decenso a you say the septuagint wa a translation from hebrew to greek and you have not show the original mean of the hebrew ie the the hebrew say and die and thu whether it wa simply echo in the greek it should also be point out that regardles of the add and die the correct translation would still be apacgw a the man do indeed die from strangulation redundant but correct further we have evidence that the septuagint wa repeatedly rewrite and reedited which include version which contradict each other and such edit wa not even necessarily execute by greek thu i be not sure that you can use the septuagint a it now stand a a paragon of ancient greek so what you really need to prove ymy point mr decenso be an example in ancient greek of someone commit apacgw and survive otherwise i would see you a simply make worthles assertion without correspond evidence now i would note mr decenso that everytime i go out of my way to research it one of ymy apparently contrive exegisi i pretty much find it false thu i think that if you be go to add to the text something over and above what the source clearly say then you have better have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it by the way a to mr rose statement about tree around the potter field there be still tree around the ledge and a rocky pavement at the bottom unles mr rose can show that these tree be two thousand year old or that there be year old stump there or ha a thousand year old description of the area which mention such tree then it be inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of tree prove the location of the tree two thousand year ago after all thing change now a to ymy other argument ie that the money juda use be not the same a the silver a to ymy second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that the money with which juda purchase the land wa indeed for the betrayal rather than some other source i would point out that in act where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity act it also specifically mention what act of iniquity they be talk about ie act concern juda who wa guide to those who arrest jesu now i would point out that when the bible describe an act of iniquity and then immediately discus the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that it wa an action of iniquity other than the one discuss notice that in verse the word iniquity be not use rather it state that juda become a guide to those who arrest jesu but the writer did not stop there v for he wa number with u and obtain a part in thi ministry what part do juda play in their ministry true peter or the author of act do not specifically call juda betrayal an iniquity but for that matter neither do john specifically call juda action an iniquity either further john do not say that juda take the money box but rather say some think that because juda have the money box jesu wa tell him buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor so after receive the morsel he immediately go out and it wa night note that it be say that juda leave it do not say that he take the money box thu when i see ymy explanation it still seem to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity mention by another author in a different book write at a different time over the iniquity explicitly mention by the author of act i find thi force and contrive of course thi particular argument become moot since we have have see evidence that apacgw mean suicide you see since juda hang wa successful he could not have spend the money mention in john because matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal wa on the high holy day ie passover and thu he could not have spend the money before kill himself the next day thu the money which buy the field of blood would have to have be the piece of silver of course he get the piece of silver that night a well and thu could have spend that either oh dear i believe that the house of card be comming down maybe we should at thi point discus now whether jesu wa crucify on friday or saturday a that be now part of the argument about juda by the way a to where the prophesy of the potter field come from ie the mention of it in matthew you say please when we be do with thi study on hi death remind me to discus thi with you i be remind you now to discus it now it all part of the same verse we be discuss and i wish you would quit procrastinate and sidestep these issue later dave butler a wise man proportion hi belief to the evidence david hume philosopher an inquiry concerning human understanding ps i would note again that you be not state that that bible be not possibly inerrant you be state that it is inerrant since you have be by ymy own admission present merely possible reconciliation i of course do rate them that highly then the best you can do be say that the bible be possibly inerrant not that it be inerrant
