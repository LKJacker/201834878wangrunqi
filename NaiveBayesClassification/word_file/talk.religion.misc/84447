from daveb dave butler subject re is it good that jesu die brian ceccarelli present u with the fallacy of false dichotomy in state that we must accept every thing in the book attribute to peter or we must discount every other book of antiquity peter die two millenium ago the original letter he write have long since decay into dust if he be alive today and i could do you question the existence of alexander the great tilgrath pilisar iius nero caligula josephu cyru the great artexerx their document have decay to dust too brian why another excuse mr ceccarelli you seem to be state that we must accept accept everything write in every historical document somehow i doubt do that yourself that thu since i doubt you accept everything write in every historical document i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the word of the book attribute to peter i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity which i be sure you reject it date from the time of ramse ius thi wa first present here by matthew wiener these inscription be carve soon after a battle and be carve with the pharoah specific approval so we have true original rather than mere copy thi account record the the battle of kadesh circa bc which occur on the river oronte about mile south of aleppo the egyptian win thi battle with the hittite and ramse have hi victory inscribe all over the place a few of of these inscription have survive in near perfect form it be a record of how the pharoah pretty much single-handedly defeat the hittite after be separate from hi troop note that the egyptian waver back and forth between first and third person the follow be from miriam lichtheim s ancient egyptian literature volume ius my majesty cause the force of the fo from hittus to fall on their face one upon the other a crocodile fall into the water of the oronte i wa after them like a griffin i attack all the country i alone for my infantry and my chariotry have desert me not one of them stand look back a i live a ra love me a my father atum favor me everything that my majesty ha tell i do it in truth in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry note thi paragraph record not only ramse divine word but also that there be thousand of witness to the event now from the heart of battle then hi majesty drive at a gallop and charge the force of the foe from hittus be alone by himself none other with him hi majesty proceed to look about him and find chariot ring him on hi way out no officer wa with me no charioteer no soldier of the army no shield-bearer my infantry my chariotry yield before them not one of them stand firm to fight with them hi majesty speak what be thi father amun is it right for a father to ignore hi son are my deed a matter for you to ignore do i not walk and stand at ymy word i have not neglect an order you give too great be he the great lord of egypt to allow alien to step on hi path what be these asiatic to you o amun the wretch ignorant of god have i not make for you many great monument i call to you my father amun i be among a host of stranger all country be array against me i be alone there none with me the labor of many person be nothing amun be more helpful than they i come here by the command of ymy mouth o amun i have not transgress ymy command now though i pray in a distant land my voice resound in southern thebe i find amun come when i call to him he give me hi hand and i rejoice he call from behind a if near by forward i be with you i ymy father my hand be with you i prevail over a hundred thousand man i be lord of victory lover of valor i find my heart stout my breast in joy all i do succeed i wa like mont i slaughter among them at my will not one look behind him not one turn around whoever fell down do not rise one call out to the other say no man be he who be among u it be seth great-of-strength baal in person not deed of man be these hi do they be of one who be unique who fight a hundred thousand without soldier and chariot come quick flee before him to seek life and breathe air for he who attempt to get close to him hi hand all hi limb grow limp one can not hold either bow or spear when one see him come race along my majesty hunt them like a griffin i slaughter among them unceasingly so you see brian we have a few original manuscript record the miraculou battle between the ramse and the hittite do you reject them a be completely true i suspect you do and if so then do you also in ymy own word question the existence of alexander the great tilgrath pilisar iius nero caligula josephu cyru the great artexerx do you also thereby question all their document that s the problem with ymy all or nothing approach many ancient person use to mix a bite of fancy with their fact so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter and the rest of the new testament or accept no record of antiquity at all force you thereby to accept the verity of document you probably do not find completely credible a to ymy other argument that so many person have testify to jesu that he must be true are you go to just pa off all thi testimony a fictiousnes are you go to call three thousand year worth of testimony from shepherd to ir agent to royal official to king to computer programmer fiction with a scoff of ymy keyboard with near complete ignorance of the testimoney be you go to say that that be all complete hooey would that not be the most audaciou display of arrogance do you actually think you know better than king solomon king david or even abraham lincoln i have three point first thi be argumentum ad populum ie appeal to popular opinion you can not vote on truth for instance do the million of hindu past and present who testify to the reality of brahma constitute actual evidence for the existence of brahma how would you answer ymy own question in regard to the testimony of hindu with a scoff of ymy keyboard with near complete ignorance of the testimoney be you go to say that that be all complete hooey if you do so scoff then how do you objectively justify ymy own special plead second it be not at all clear that king solomon or king david testify to jesu you can claim it to be clear but that do not make it true third it be quite arguable that abraham lincoln wa not christian and that he have both a public and a private view of christianity in fact there wa much discussion about it in hi day ye he wa publically accuse of be a deist oh my i be presently collect a faq for lincoln a i previously do for tyre jefferson and etc later dave butler my earlier view of the unsoundnes of the christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scripture have become clearer and stronger with advance year and i see no reason for think i shall ever change them abraham lincoln to judge j s wakefield after the death of willie lincoln
