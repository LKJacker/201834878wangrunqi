from bskendig brian kendig subject re is it good that jesu die jason jason smith write bskendig brian kendig write and i felt tear when i begin to disagree with a lot of what the bible and my priest tell me did it start get a little uncomfortable did ymy style start feel a bite cramp ye that exactly what i felt my heart just felt that what i wa be teach wa wrong a basically good message but frame in error i could not with a clear conscience accept that woman be somehow not equal to man that homosexual be guilty of their lifestyle that pride in one work be a bad thing that jesu die for me i do want anybody to die for me especially a an impersonal act where the person ca possibly even know me well enough to really know if i worth die for or not i wa never able to accept the bite about jesu death be a good thing if that mean that i just not comprehend a basic message of christianity then so be it maybe i just not compatible with christianity i just refuse to follow rule blindly and since i ca even convince myself that ymy god even exist in the way you describe it i get to just follow my own conscience in these matter i know how that go knowing i could and do want to live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rule be what keep me outside too do think that my moral be shoddy or nonexistent just because i do believe in ymy god i will not steal and i will not murder not because i fear divine repudiation but because these just in my character you may think there nothing keep me from just run around on a murder spree steal thing when i able insult person for the heck of it because i not answerable to anyone but you be wrong i answerable to myself a life like that would be a cheap life i happen to want to earn respect in myself i meet the man that be my initial break with christianity come after a lot of soul-searching and a lot of wonder why i could no longer feel the of god with me i finally decide that i have once felt thi presence just a i have felt my mighty teddy bear beside me when i wa a little tyke protect me from the monster under the bed that i have believe in god just a i have believe in the teddy bear a something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceive danger since then i never abandon the possibility that maybe ymy supernatural trinity do exist but there be a few time when in my darken room by my bed i have set aside everything i believe for a moment and call out to whatever out there because i want to know the truth even if it mean abandon everything i know and i have not yet receive an answer only when i truly listen to myself body and soul do i realize that i could no longer honestly keep up the charade of be christian there be a higher truth in the universe and christianity just ai it any suggestion on what or who or where it might be and why nope it may well be unknowable scientist have suggest that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself the three-dimensional universe may be map onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional sphere see sphereland the sequel to flatland for more think on thi my entire universe might just be an electron in a fmy dimensional universe which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that and so on and so forth until the variable become too much for u to even speculate on that be there no possible way for u to know exactly how we come to be so there no reason at all to believe that ymy god exist nor have anything to do with it ok you may say so now if i just be good be i do good enough that for you to answer if you feel you do fine then go ahead and ignore u foolish little christian we can present what we see and experience provide my witnes but it be up to u to make that seed sprout christian have provide me with nothing except quote from ymy holy book and all sort of tactic to try to get me to believe guilt trip insinuation that i without moral argument from disbelief how can you possibly believe that god exist and so forth all i ask be for you to convince me i want to be convince but it not go to be easy so much a you do like what we sell there just may be someone out there that can identify with it methink you could give u all a lesson in tolerance and back off having have year upon year of contact with ymy religion from both the inside and the outside i view it a harmful in many way it prey on person who want to find mean in their life and once it get these person it teach them to have pity and sometime starkly intolerant of other who do not share these view maybe you say that ymy religion do teach that but i get to judge christianity from the christian i know i feel that it be entirely possible and good to have faith in one self and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that so i hope that my word in thi newsgroup will at least make some person think i want christian to realize that there be perfectly valid lifestyle and opinion that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever and i want person who be consider christianity to realize that christianity do not hold the sole key to a happy fulfil life i have know some very nice christian who have do some very nice thing i think what set these person apart from the general mass be that they recognize that their religiou belief may be wrong and they know the weakness of their religion yet they still decide to believe but they keep their belief to themself and do not think any le of person who do agree with them obviously the debate on the veracity and reliability of the source of the christian faith be far from conclusive notwithstanding how vehemently we propose otherwise precisely my point you still not give me a reason to be a christian instead of a buddhist or a moslem the nice thing about religion if you lose yourself deeply enough in it be that eventually you be able to feel justify in most anything you want to do ymy right fortunately for everyone around me i not religiou i a christian just a the moslem be religiou and the buddhist be religiou who be religiou then brian kendig je ne sui fait comme aucun bskendig de ceux que vu croire fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent the mean of life si je ne vaux pa mieux au moin je sui autre be that it end rousseau
