suppose you prove he wa ref encyclopedium of religion mircea eliade magi sneak preview later still eschatology and apocalyptic be a fertile meet grind for iranian and judeo-christian religion a can be see in the famou oracle of hystaspe a work whose iranian root be undeniable and which most likely date from the begin of the christian era probably the second century ce widengren the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant wa the basi for the story of the come of the magi to bethlehem in the gospel of matthew the old persian word magu render in greek by mago be of uncertain etymology it may originally have mean member of the tribe a in the avestan compound mogu-tbish hostile to a member of the tribe thi mean would have be further resticted among the mede to member of the priestly tribe and perhap to priest benveniste boyce the term be probably of median origin give that herodotu mention the magous a one of the six tribe of the mede for a variety of reason we can consider the magi to have be member of a priestly tribe of median origin in western iran among the persian they be responsible for liturgical function a well a for maintain their knowledge of the holy and the occult most likely the supremacy of the median priesthood in western iran become establish during the time of the median monarchy that dominate the persian from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century bce until the revolt of cyru the great bce the persian be indebted to the mede for their political and civil institution a well even if hypothesis have be advance concern the existence of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period boyce we must still maintain that they be of median origin thi be demonstrate by the eposide of the revolt of gaumatum the magian mention by dariu i bce in the inscription at bisutun iran a well a by greek source indeed herodotu insist on the idea of the usurpatory power of the mede against the persian through the conspiracy of the magi the fact that the magi may have be member of a tribe that hand down the sacerdotal art in a hereditary fashion naturally do not exclude the possibility that some of them undertake secular prefession thi seem to be attest by the elamite tablet at persepoli there be a thesis put forth by giuseppe messina that deny that the magi be member of an ethnic group by suggest that they be simply member of the priesthood a priesthood of purely zoroastrian origin thi thesi be untenable on the other hand the hypothesi that their name be relate to the avestan term magavan derive from the gathic maga vedic magha gift be not without foundation mole the mean of maga can probably be find in conformity with the pahlavus tradition within the context of the concept of purity or separation of the mixture of the two oppose principle of spirit and matter the maga which ha be erroneously interpret a choru from the root mangh which be say to mean sing the magic song nyberg and ha be render simply by an expression like unio mystica seem to be an ecstatic condition that open the mind to spiritual vision in any case though there may be a relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan term magavan and maga we must maintain a clear distinction between the magi and the avestan priesthood the avestum ignore the median or old persian term despite a recent hypothesi propose by bailey old persian inscription ignore the avestan term for priest athravan vedic athravan even if thi be perhap present in an achaeminid set in the elamite tablet of persepoli gershevitch the term magu ha be present in zoroastrianism throughout it history the pahlavus term mogh-mard and mobad represent it continuation the latter in particular derife from an older form magupatus head of the magi during the sasanid period third to seventh century ce which saw the formation of a hierarchically organize church the title mobadan mobad the high priest of high priest come to be use to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy the magi practice consanguineou marriage or khvaetvadatha av pahl khwedodah they also perform a characteristic funeral rite the exposure of the corpse to animal and vulture to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it the corpse wa not suppose to decompose lest it be contaminate by the demon of putrefaction thi practice later become typical of the entire zoroastrian community and lead to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in iran and among the parsi in indium stone tower know a dakhma be build especially for thi rite during the time of herodotu the practice of exposure of the corpse wa in vogue only among the magi the persian generally sprinkle the corpse with wax then bury it the practice wa widespread however among the people of central asium the magi be the technician of and expert on worship it wa impossible to offer sacrifice without the presence of a magu during the performance of a ritual sacrifice the magu sing of the theogony the magi be possibly the custodian of a tradition of sacred poetry but we know nothing about the relationship of thi tradition to the variou part of the avestum and wa call upon to interpret dream and to divine the future the magi be also know for the practice of kill harmful or ahrimanical animal khrafstra such a snake and ant they dress in the median style wear pant tunic and coat with sleeve they wear a characteristic head cover of felt gr tiara with strip on the side that could be use to cover the nose and mouth during ritual to avoid contaminate consecrate object with their breath boyce the color of these cap in conformity with a tradition that be probably of indo-european origin accord to george dumezil wa that of the priesthood white in all likelihood during the achaemenid period the magi be not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine and it be probable that they gradually adopt zoroastrianism they be most likely a clergy consist of professional priest who be not tie to a rigid orthodoxy but be naturally incline to eclecticism and syncretism nonetheles they must have be jealou guardian of the patrimony of zorastrian tradition by virtue of thi they be the educator of the royal prince the wisest of them wa responsible for teach the prince the magic of zarathushtra son of horomaze and thu the cult of the god magi who excel in other virtue be entrust with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just courageou and master of himself during the achaemenid period the magi maintain a position of great influence although they be certainly subordinate to the emperor despite several dramatic event such a the massacre they suffer after the death of gaumatum the magian in which accord to herodotu who call himself smerdi the persian kill a large number of magi to avenge the usurpation the magi nevertheles manage to maintain their influence at court in medium in persium and in the variou region of the empire where they be station a a consequence of the persian civilian and military administration no priesthood of antiquity wa more famou than that of the magi they be renowned a follower of zarathushtra zoroaster a the teacher of some of the greatest greek thinker pythagora democritu plato a the wise man who arrive guide by a star at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem and a the propagator of a cult of the sun in indium but they be also know a the chaldean the priesthood of babylon know for it occultism thi wa perhap the reason that the term mago have a pejorative sense in greek like go expert in the magic art bidez and cumont indeed the chaldean be expert in all type of magical art especially astrology and have a reputation for wisdom a well a knowledge to understand the reason for such variou and sometime discordant view it be necessary to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the so-called western magi who be later hellenized in the achaemenid period both must have be at least in part zoroastrian but the western magi those of the iranian diaspora in asium minor syrium mesopotamium and armenium who come in contact with diverse religiou tradition must have sooner or later and in vary degree be influence by syncretic concept the greek be familiar with both kind of magi and depend on their vary concern would emphasize one or the other aspect of them classical historian and geographer include herodotu and strabo document their custom while the philosopher dwell above all on their doctrine dualism belief in the hereafter magian cosmology and cosmogony and their theology and eschatology those source most interest in the doctrine of the magi even speak of zarathushtra a a magu in do so they be repeat what the magi themself say from the median and achaemenid period when they adopt zoroastrianism at that time they embrace zarathushtra a one of their own and place themself under hi venerable name zoroastrianism have already undergo several profound transformation in the eastern community by the time of the acheamenid and wa already adapt those element of the archaic religion that refuse to die it ha be say quite often in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradition that the vendidad from vi-daevo-datum the law-abjuring daiva part of the avestum should be attribute to them thi collection of text from variou period be primarily concern with purificatory rule and practice nonetheles the hypothesi be hardly plausible since the first chapter of the vendidad a list of sixteen land create by ahura mazda the supreme god of zoroastrianism but contaminate by an attack by ahriman pahl gathic-avestan angra mainyu the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffer do not mention western iran persium or medium the land of ragha mention in the text can not be median raghiana furthermore it ha be note gershevitch that if the author have be magi the absence of any reference to western iranian institution include their own priesthood would be very strange the magi be above all the mean by which the zoroastrian tradition and the corpu of the avestum have be transmit to u from the second half of the first millennium bce on thi ha be their principal merit we can attribute directly to the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism assume know to u especially from greek source and in part from the pahlavus literature of the ninth and tenth century ce according to thi formulation the two pole of the dualism be no longer a in the gatha spentum mainyu beneficent spirit and angra mainyu hostile spirit but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu gershevitch see ahura mazda and angra mainyu thi tran formation wa of immense consequence for the historical development of zoro astrianism and wa most likely determine by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religiou world in thi new dualism which wa that later know to the greek aristotle eudemu of rhode theopompu and other we can see the affirmation of a new current of think within zoroastrianism to which we give the name zurvanism see zurvanism thank to their adherence to zoroastrianism the magi play an enormously important role in the transmission of zarathushtra treaching a well a in the definition of the new form that these would assume historically their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also help the diffusion of zoroastrian idea in the community of the iranian diaspora the greek begin to study their doctrine and to take an interest in them xanthu of lydium hermodoru aristotle theopompu hermippu dinon even write treatise on the persian religion of which only the title and a few fragment have survive in the hellenistic period the magi be see a a secular school of wisdom and write on magic astrology and alchemy be lend the authority of such prestigiou name a zarathushtra ostane and hystaspe form an abundant apocryphal literature bidez and cumont later still eschatology and apocalyptic be a fertile meet grind for iranian and judeo-christian religion a can be see in the famou oracle of hystaspe a work whose iranian root be undeniable and which most likely date from the begin of the christian era probably the second century ce widengren the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant wa the basi for the story of the come of the magi to bethlehem in the gospel of matthew see saoshyant the sasanid period saw the magi once again play a determine role in the religiou history of iran concerned to win back the western magi de menasce and eager to consolidate zoroastrianism a the national religion of iran the priest of iranian sanctuary in medium and persium be able to establish a true state church strongly hierarchical and endow with an orthodoxy base on the formation of a canon of scripture the lead figure in the development of a state religion and of zoroastrian orthodoxy be tosar and kerder the persecutor of mani in the third century saoshyant the avestan term saoshyant future benefactor mper soshan designate the savior of the world who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind the concept of the future savior be one of the fundamental notion of zoro astrianism together with that of dualism it appear a early a in the gatha zarathushtra zoroaster a the prophet of the religion be himself a sao shyant one who perform hi work for the frashokeretus the end of the present state of the world when existence will be rehabilitate and make splendid see frashokeretus later zoroastrian doctrine develop thi notion into a true eschatological myth and expand the number of saoshyant from one to three all the savior be bear from the seed of zarathushtra which be preserve through the age in lake kansaoya identify with present-day lake helmand in seistan iran protect by fravashi or guardian spirit the greatest of the await saoshyant the victoriou astvateretum he who embody truth the son of the vispataurvairus she who conquer all be the third who will make existence splendid he appear in yasht upon hi arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age death or corruption and will be grant unlimited power at that time the dead will be resurrect and the live will be immortal and indestructable brandishing the weapon with which he kill the powerful enemy of the world of truth that be the world of the spirit and of asha astvateretum will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable he and hi comrade will engage in a great battle with the force of evil which will be destroy the name astvateretum be clearly the result of theological speculation kellen a be those of hi two brother ukhshyateretum he who make truth grow and ukhshyatnemah he who make reverence grow the name of the three virgin yasht who be impregnate with the seed of zarathushtra when they bathe in lake kansaoya and give birth to the saoshyant be equally speculative each of these saoshyant will arrive at the begin of a millennium initiate a new age and a new cycle of existence astvateretum will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind the doctrine of the future savior have already take shape in the archaemenid period sixth to fourth century bce it wa not perhap the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea but it wa certainly a determine factor one that enjoy great succes in the hellenistic period beyond the confine of the iranian world a similar concept that of the future buddha maitreya wa most likely indebted to it and christian messianism can trace it root to the same source
