from ml michael siemon subject re christian meta-ethic in turpin russell turpin write in article ml michael siemon write the issue then be thi christian a say behavior such-and-such be sinful what be christian b suppose to do with such a statement one possibility alway exist a may be able to persuade b that the behavior in question do exhibit a failure in love god or neighbor michael modern liberal that he be read a fairly benign mean into thi word he then construct hi religiou belief around thi understand read other scripture in the context of these commandment with love benignly understand i regard love a no more or le benign than any other christian do you be merely express approval of the consequence i find therein which say more about my politic and cultural trap than about my or any religion love be a highly ambiguou word of which christian can write both the gentle word paul use of it in corinthian in a passage that even the conservative will quote at you and the word of t s eliot in hi pentacost hymn love be the unfamiliar name that weave the intolerable shirt of flame thi be in any case rather to the side of what i wa attempt to raise in my note a will become more evident below a a non-believer i find michael christianity kinder and gentler blechhh i think you be misread me rather seriously though give my principle that one can not force one own notion of sin on another and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism russel turpin and other believer and unbeliever alike be under no threat of my legislate my own understand of christian love if i take him at hi word he can not condemn the inquisitor because they be also follow these commandment a they understand them if you misread i can do and have repeatedly do a complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibit in a thorough a form a anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it ha do to human be in the first place and to respect for let alone love of god in near succession please go back to my quote word above the possibility that alway exist be that i or to revert to proper time sequence my predecessor over the last several century could persuade christian b of my case that the inquisition do indeed constitute an egregiou violation of the law of love i must also note that the majority of christian have be so persuade by christian argumentation a well a by secular both christian and non-christian prohibition what mr turpin allude to be a trickier point a i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involve in the inquisition b the inquisitor respond that mother church must however painful thi seem discipline her child for their own good in thi case the salvation of their soul or if the torture heretic will not recant than by bad example deter other from the same los-of-soul a i point out that thi justification of a failure in love depend on a highly speculative construal of text and of philosophical assertion that be quite undemonstrable b burn me at the stake my rhetoric ha fail but the point i be make be sustain what be go on here ha a lot to do with cultural baggage in thi case the baggage include a nearly universal and absolutely secular belief that an accuse person must prove innocence and that testimony be most believable if take under torture the elimination of inqisitorial practice in those place where it ha be eliminate or at least greatly reduce ha very little if anything to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between a and b mr turpin be point out that if i be a versu the grand inquisitor b then my persuasion be not very likely to work i know thi and in what ever personal agony i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense attorney so one possibility fail in thi case a it will fail in may other at the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when it properly should not if it entail mistake assumption i share with the inquisitor and that be potentially an even more trouble case in that many of the victim of inquisition will have accept that they be in fact sinful in such random case a they may actually have be guilty of charge bring against them the point be that the persuasion break down when the party do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage and give the main thrust of the inquisition against heresy it be bind to break down in precisely the worst case the conservative i do think that be the right word btw will take refuge in what i attribute to b above that he be justify in cause harm because he think that work to a greater good but thi be a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel a if one theory about sin entitle one to cast aside jesu word on deal with sinner cf matthew i be a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously or for that matter what do it mean to love one fellow man and what be the right thing and how do one go about love god well the whole point of make these the base commandment be that they reducible to rule a set of rule be a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for act such thing can be very helpful to individual or society but not if they be use instead of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one action the great commandment be more than anything else a call to act a if you be god and accept ultimate responsibility in ymy every action a demand that i like most would rather not hear but it keep pop up nonetheles along with the reassurance that it be more important that i be open to try thi than succeed at it conservative may twist thi act a if you be god to mean lay down rule for other person and be a nasty to them a possible if they do keep ymy rule they be so insistent and obviou about thi that they have convince a lot of person who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy is how god act that after all be the standard accusation against god by the atheist here and elsewhere that the conservative have confuse their manipulative hoop-jumping notion of coerce other person with the nature of god be almost the entire content of standard american atheism and i quite agree with it on thi point ethical system be not differentiate by the nice sound goo up front much of which sound pretty much the same but by the specific act procedure and argument that they recommend and different body of christian have from the begin urge different ethical system or in some case none a a result it be bizarre to identify any one of these system however popular or infamou with christianity christianity do not have a torah it do not have a specifically christian scripture ha very little if anything in the way of commandment so little that the christian who desperately want commandment go mine for them with almost no support and thu almost no obviou limitation for their effort the one single thing in the gospel which jesu specifically gife a a commandment to u be love one another i will be expand on thi point in a reply to paul hudson that i hope to get to in a day or so it be quite true that some christian infer lot of commandment from the nt i point out what ha to be go on in these inference and why there be a huge amount of cultural baggage involve you be quite right that thi be goo if one be look for an ethical system but why should anyone be look for an ethical system since my society be eager to hand u one or more no matter what we do it may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical system in which case i will profer the agapate allelou once again i be glad that a few christian such a michael find a benign mean for the goo and then interpret the usually ugly specific in a more constructive fashion on the other hand i do think that thi tell u more about michael and christian like him that it tell u about christianity i think you be beg the question why do i and the myriad of other christian like me tell you something about christianity nor be thi very new in christianity you might want to look up the origin and fundamental doctrine of the quaker from the century onward and they be not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that be congenial to my case michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you nevertheles or you shall die like man and fall ml like any prince psalm
