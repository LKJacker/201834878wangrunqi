from mlee malcolm lee subject the law of god wa re a kind and loving god in article rob lanphier write these be two conflict statement to say one be a clarification of the other be a breach of logic i do mind person shift their position on an issue it irritate me when it be say under the premise that no change wa make what about deuteronomy is it wrong now did jesu change that if anything he clarify the law such a in that quote you make in the follow verse jesu take several portion of the law and expound upon the law give clearer mean to what god intend sure he do thi however he do addres the notion of stone non-virgin bride because thi need no clarification are you go to deny that deuteronomy be not patently clear in it intent i see what you be get at or at least i think i do correct me if i be mistake but i think you be ask me if i still believe that we should uphold all of the law pertain to capital punishment for such thing a adultery rape and other heinou crime a you may recall jesu wa confront by thi same question in regard to the adultres who wa catch in the act and bring before jesu and hi reply let he who be without sin cast the first stone jesu do not deny the sentence that be to due for thi violation of the law what do you think of thi i think you will agree with me that there be in today world a lot of modern-day pharisee who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it what good be head knowledge if there be nothing in the heart i agree that there be a lot of modern day pharisee that know the bible from end to end and do believe in it depending on how they use thi knowledge they can be scary they can argue any position they desire and back it up with select part of the bible such pharisee include david koresh and adolph hitler i will qualify thi by say i do know if they actually believe what they be preach but the end certainly make the mean look frighten agreed however just a scary be those that do know much of the bible but believe every word in fact thi be probably scarier since there be far more of these person from what i see in addition they be very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned pharisee since they do know enough to debate with these person agreed also if one be to use the bible a a reference one must alway be open to different interpretation a a christian i have the spirit of god to verify what i believe in the word if what the spirit tell me be not back up in scripture then the spirit i be communicate with be not of god after all jesu tell u to test the spirit to know for sure that it be from god christianity be not just a set of rule it a lifestyle that change one perspective and personal conduct and it demand obedience to god will no it demand obedience to a book if god come down and personally tell me how i should behave then i would say that i would be do god will by do it however if preacher pastor and evangelist tell me to obey the will of a book write by person who have be dead for close to two millenium even longer for the ot even if i follow everything in it with my heart i could scarcely be honest with myself by say i do the will of god i obey what the spirit of god tell me to do the spirit will not violate anything that be write in the bible because that be the word of god i do not worship pastor preacher my wife my mother or my father what they tell me do not carry the weight of what god tell me to do and hi command be rienforced in the bible some person can live by it but many other can not or will not that be their choice and i have to respect it because god respect it too well if god respect it so much how come there be talk in the bible about eternal damnation for non-believer i see little respect eminating from the god of the bible i see a selfish and spiteful god eternal damnation be the consequence of the choice one make in reject god if you choose to jump off a cliff you can hardly blame god for you go splat at the bottom he know that if you choose to jump that you will die but he will not prevent you from make that choice in fact he send hi son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what ly below to prove that point jesu take that plunge himself but he be god wa able to rise up again i have see the example of christ and have choose not to jump and i try to tell you not to jump or else you go splat you do have to listen to me and i wo stop you if you decide to jump i only ask that you check it out before take the plunge you owe it to yourself i do like see anyone go splat god be with you malcolm lee
