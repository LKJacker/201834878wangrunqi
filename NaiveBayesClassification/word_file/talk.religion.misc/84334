from dpw david wood subject re law of god wa re a kind and loving god mlee write dpw david wood write mlee malcolm lee write these law write for the israelite god choose person whom god have expressly set apart from the rest of the world the israelite be a direct witnes to god existence to disobey god after knowing that god be real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable remember these law be write for a different time and apply only to god choose person but jesu ha change all of that we be live in the age of grace sin be no longer immediately punishable by death there be repentance and there be salvation through my lord jesu christ and not just for a few choose person salvation be available to everyone jew and gentile alike sorry if thi be late for the thread but i think god wa suppose to be constant and never-changing how do you reconcile thi common christian view with the paragraph above god never change sorry but ye he do by ymy own description he still love u sending jesu wa one of hi attempt to reconcile with mankind humorou thi notion of an all-knowing all-powerful god who must attempt to reconcile with hi lowly creation i realize that it be not possible to penetrate such logic but be there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything and further that an attempt to reconcile imply a lack of omniscience what you be do here be project human weakness onto ymy god also while we at it how do you reconcile a kind and loving god with the judeo-christian view that sin wa at one time immediately punishable by death wa kill person for sin god way of show kindnes and love sinning in the face of god wa punishable by immediate death there be several ot passage to back thi up god be god but all human be sinner thu all pre-jesu human should have be punish with death we be punish with sin now of course because god ha change he require a brutal sadistic sacrifice of hi own blood in order to allow u to sin without immediate death he can not tolerate the prescence of sin in hi midst yet he do so now he ha change the sadistic murder of hi own son ha make him more tolerant of my sin beside hi midst be everywhere so ymy statement be meaningles he tolerate sin in hell which surely be in hi midst a well also give that he be all-knowing he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sin a well a when and where so what do tolerance have to do with anything all of thi be absolute nonsense unles ymy god be not indeed all-knowing and all-powerful or unles he do take the personal interest in everyday affair that you claim and the israelite know thi and still some of them choose to disobey and be destroy were these person kind and loving themself not relevant the claim of kindnes and lovingnes wa make by you in reference to ymy god the nature of hi be not at issue god give them every break he could but in the end he really have no choice in the matter i see an all-knowing god who do not know what the ultimate outcome would be and an all-powerful god who have no choice in the matter mindmush seeing a how we be fail to achieve salvation on my own he send hi son to die for u to be the ultimate sin offer did i mi something did you give some indication at to why a kind and loving god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow hi own botch creation to achieve salvation is the fact the he no longer do thi an admission on hi part of have make a mistake he send hi son a a consolation to u out of love i note that ymy answer physically follow my question but i fail to discern a connection between the two by the way for what be i be console now that we be live in the age of grace do thi mean that for my sin god now damn u to eternal hell after we die rather than kill u immediately if so be thi eternal damnation an example of a kind and loving god hey let be fair for a moment here kind and loving do not mean a free ride why not by the way i note for the record that you do answer the question there be an amount of give and take a in any relationship parent be suppose to be kind and love but do that mean that child can do whatever they want not part of be a parent mean administer punishment when the child be at fault death eternal damnation be ymy idea of correctional punishment i hope you be a parent part of be a parent mean give instruction god test u through the trial of life such that we may grow stronger he teach what be right and what be wrong thi be quite an elaborate fantasy that you construct but sadly it lack a basi in reality it also do not addres the question that i raise the consequence of my action be make clear to u be it heaven or be it hell if god do not follow through with what he ha warn u about he would not be a very good parent the god that you describe be not a good parent but a tyrant in parent if a parent issue a warn but do not follow through with it the child will not take that parent word very seriously god do the same by tell u who have ear to hear what to do and what not to do by life trial we see the folly of do my own will rather than hi he warn u about the consequence of reject him when it come time for judgement sorry wa that the god of the bible whose rule i be to follow or the god of the koran the veda the book of koresh oh ye it all so clear do we follow him i will bully for you
