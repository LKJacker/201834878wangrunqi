from subject part and part re homosexuality tony i read ymy post it wa nothing new i have see much the same in other typical christian anti-gay sentimental literature gay person be and will con tinue to be persecute a long a such propaganda petpetuate you may be unaware of all the statistica find concern african-american that have be publish and use by variou group to re-enforce their own bia against african-american we usually think of the kkk in these instance but there be many other group of course the vast majority of the public scoff at such find and document today but that wa not alway the case fortunately african-american have white who support their and public sentiment wa eventually if not entirely turn around there wa even a civil war and anti-negro sentiment increase in fact until law be put in place to protect the inalienable right of black it wa pretty much legal to discriminate against them i know many gay and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination you may think that i have be deceive or something that be ymy perogative my church christian church disciple of christ openly affirm the right of oppress person of all segment of society include gay we believe the gospel message of preach to all creation and make disciple we believe in the lord great commandment to love and we beleive in stand up for the oppress even if it be not popular to do so i really like my church for last reason the most i can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stand for the gospel and believe in the commandment of love though i hard-pressed to find many who actually sho love but not many be will to champion the oppress especially within their own community i may have lose face with the greater christian community for the unpopularity of my belief but so do the abolitionist against the oppression of african-american many be even kill and treat a runaway slave for be nigger-lover and such i gues i decide the challenge be worth it in my talk with gay man and woman i have hear tragic story after tragic story center around fail marriage wife and husband who be straight who have be hurt in the proces etc funny thing be i do know of one case where the parent ex-wife or even child have continue to reject their gay family member son daughter ex-husband father etc after they begin to take part in some form of support group like pflag i apalled by the legislation which pass in colorado and be equally rag that such slimey person a loui sheldon from the tradition value coalition have be actively work in the christian underground to garner support within several i believe state thi come november for more oppressive legisation against gay perhap you do get it and maybe you never will many do get it in the middle age and the proclaim god will be do a they massacre thousand in witch hunt and inquisition the message that come through loud and clear by proponent against gay right and against gay in general be that there be a strong dislike even hatred for gay whether you want to call it such or not it do change the result the major flaw in all thi posture be that in the end the final effect of post like that of your and mr hudson be that you have a conditional love for gay condition change and we love you thi be sure strange come from a group who claim that god ha an unconditional love one that call person just a they be sure there be thing that will change and habit like alcoholism wife beat etc that need to be change through some sort of therapy but then there be thing like left-handednes etc that no amount of beat it out of person be go to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other person expectation in the proces thi coerce conformity cause many person a great deal of harm especially when it be cause by person who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puff up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality thi be sad but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basi ha to do with something very personal like a taboo subject even today but i firmly believe in the right of individual to be free from impose regulation on thier bedroom it funny that most straight person have successfully remove restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain thi little chestnut of repression a though it help u maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society gay person be not criminal another interest thing happen recently a very prominent charismatic church in the silicon valley here have two of it pastor arrest for self admit charge of pederasty man have sex with boy thi have apparently be go on for some time a couple year but since the charge be voluntary and the church work closely with the polouse so i imagine that wa how they manage to downplay it in the medium how could such a thing happen when the church itself ha an ex-gay ministry one of my friend recently tell me he wa approach by someone who be go through the reparitive therapy there and he wa thoroughly convince that the request for dinner wa not an invitation to attend the ministry these be difficult time we live in but provide hostile environment and create and perpetuate an atmosphere that breed hate and violence be not the call of the christian community the result of the pass amendment in colorado ha create an organization who poster be appear all over colorado call i forget the whole definition off hand but the last part wa against immoral gros homosexual trash and their motto be working for a fag-free america with an implicit advocation for violence thi be sick and it seem to be what you and mr hudson and other be embrace we christian have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression toward those we feel do up and constant beratement from organization like the christian research institute while they do have a good purpose also their major work seem to be find new and better way of exclude person the gospel i believe be not so negative rather it seek way to include person i have several of dr martin book and find them quite helpful especially concern but it seem that crus ha become a cult unto itself why do we just stick to the positive and find way to bring person to jesu istead of take bullwhip and drive them away whatever rich
