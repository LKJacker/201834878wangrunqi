from pharvey paul harvey subject re christian above the law wa clarification of pe in article nunnally john nunnally write when be we go to hear a christian answer to thi question in paraphrase on what or whose authority do christian proclaim that they be above the law and above the prophet major and minor and not accountable to the ten commandment of which jesu clearly speak hi opinion in matthew what be the source of thi pseudo-doctrine who be the pseudo-teacher who be the great deceiver ok here at least one christian answer jesu wa a jew not a christian in thi context matthew make sense matt do not think that i jesu come to abolish the law or the prophet i do not come to abolish but to fulfill jesu live under the jewish law however he wa the culmination of the promise of the prophet he come to fulfill the prophecy and fully obey god purpose verse say for truly i say to you until heaven and earth pa away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pa away from the law until all be accomplish the key to thi verse imho be the last phrase jesu a the fulfillment of the law accomplish what the law wa suppose to accomplish jesu do not say that he wa the fulfillment of the law and unles i mistake heaven and earth have not yet pass away am i mistake and even assume that one can just glos over that portion of the word of jesu do you really think that all be accomplish verse whoever then annul one of the least of these commandment and so teach other shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keep and teach them he shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven taken in the context of jesu teach jewish person about live life under the law thi make sense then why do jesu say any jew who annul in v are you say that all of jesu record word mean nothing to gentile are you really say that jesu only speak for and to the jew jesu do mention ymy name do that mean he wa speak to you when you read the word of jesu do you think he be speak to someone other than you in general it appear that jesu be respond to some criticism he must have receive about do away with the law that wa not jesu intent at all you say above that jesu wa the fulfillment of the law are you say that do not mean do away with the law he have come to earth to live the law a it should be live and fulfill the promise make by god to hi person all the way back to eve gen serpent will bruise ymy heel but he will bruise hi head jp i will put enmity between you and the woman and between ymy offspring and her they shall strike at ymy head and you shall strike at their heel nrsv i will put enmity between you and the woman and between ymy offspring and her he will strike ymy head and you will strike hi heel kjv and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise hi heel look like ymy translation ha take a few liberty with the word jesu appear to be do away with the law because he do not honor the tradition of man a equal to the law of god he regularly lock horn with the religiou leader of the day because he would not conform to their rule only god law in the matthew passage jesu be defend hi dedication to the law and defend himself against hi accusor almost the entire sermon on the mount matt be dedicate to help the jewish person understand the true intent of the law sweep away the clutter which have be introduce by the pharasee and their tradition only help the jewish person in galatian paul describe the relationship of jesu to the law in thi way but before faith come we be keep in custody under the law be shut up to the faith which wa later to be reveal therefore the law ha become my tutor to lead u to christ that we may be justify by faith but now that faith ha come we be no longer under a tutor for you be all son of god through faith in christ jesu i believe thi say that after christ wa reveal the law have serve it purpose my tutor to lead u to christ and now we be no longer under a tutor the law ha be fulfil a christ say he would do you be use ymy interpretation of paul a an argument against the clear word of jesu god the author of the old law and the jesu be the same personality therefore the old law and the new testament the last will and testament of jesu be base on the same moral principle it make sense that many of the principle in the old law be re-expressed in christianity re-expressed care to define that a bite better on the other hand now that the law ha fulfil it purpose and what are heaven and earth go away where do they go is all accomplish for example revelation explain please christian relate to god through christ not the law it also make sense that new practice and new symbolism be establish to represent the mystery of thi new relationship baptism represent christ death burial and resurrection rom the lord supper a a memorial to hi sacrifice i cor and sunday a a day of worship commemorate hi resurrection matt act again ymy interpretation of paul versu the clear word of jesu do you see any problem here when do heaven and earth go away when wa all accomplish ok that one christian explanation i do claim to have all these issue completely settle even in my own mind and i welcome other christian to offer other alternative please excuse the long post thank for ymy interest if you have read thi far
