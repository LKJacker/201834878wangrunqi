from deane david matthew deane subject re flaming nazi okay i bite i should probably leave thi alone but what the heck in article gsmith gene w smith write in article popec pope charle write rhoemer wa the name of the guy responsible for much of the uniform and prop use by the early nazi in their rally and such the name be roehm not rhoemer and hitler do claim that he come up with the swastika busines but do he credit the actual flag design to a party member some dentist or other i believe he gife such credit in mein kampf he wa kill in an early nazi purge he and many of hi associate be flame homosexual well know also for their flamboyant orgy i have be try to find if there be any actual evidence for thi common assertion recently posting to such group a and ha not uncover any who could provide any well i no expert but all of the history of nazi germany assert thi they make reference to several scandal that occur long before the night of the long knife the impression that i get wa that homosexuality in portion of the sa wa common knowledge also a book by a homosexual author whose name escape me at the moment call homosexual in history assert that roehm and heine be homosexual a well a other in roehm sa circle all the book say that roehm and hi associate edmund heine be homosexual i have be able to find nothing beyond that and suspect thi to be a sort of historical urban legend well you the one who be in germany if you do believe the history book look up the primary source yourself those of u outside of germany do not have acces to these you do it seem to me that there be plenty of document instance several scandal the fact that on the knight of the long knife several sa member include heine be find sleep together etc also i believe some person be complain about the sa homosexual activity seduce young boy etc the history that i read make a very convince case none of thi sound like urban legend to me irving a notoriously unreliable historian say that funk the nazi finance minister wa homosexual he gife no source i know next to nothing about irving and nothing about funk what precisely do you know that would contradict all of the other history book that i have read concern the existence of homosexual nazi are you try to say that all historian be take part in an anti-homosexual smear what about homosexual writer who agree with the official history do you think they would have find out the truth by now if roehm and heine be not homosexual i would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from nazism no one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexual in any case i challenge anyone to document thi claim if you be go to challenge all historian on thi point not just irving then the burden of proof be on you track down the reference find out where the story originate from again you be the one in germany close to archival material most person on the net be not i have find a great deal of evidence that there be many flame heterosexual among the nazi thi seem to include all of the worst one hitler himmler goebbel goering heydrich eichmann and many more eh what be ymy agenda here to prove that the nazi be heterosexual so that you can bash heterosexual do it bother you that some of the nazi might have be homosexual do thi make all homosexual bad if thi be true of course not and what about bisexual are they half-nazi i do know why it would be so difficult to believe that some nazi be homosexual the german officer corp before for instance wa notoriou for it homosexuality there be numerou scandal which rock the german govt during the late and early century many of the kaiser friend be prosecute the kaiser wa no homosexual but the germany army have a long tradition of tolerate homosexuality go far back into prussian history back to frederick the great at least who wa himself a homosexual roehm wa a product of thi prussian officer tradition and the old german army like the english public school system be a well know center of homosexuality would have be quite will to overlook roehm homosexuality in addition some nazi complain of homosexuality in the hitler youth the hitler youth swallow up all pre-nazi youth group and some of the variou pre-war vandervogel bund and volkish youth group be know to promote homoerotic ideal and friendship and in many case homosexuality itself so it seem to me not unlikely that there be plenty of homosexual nazi regardles of the official nazi dogma concern the evil of homosexuality why should thi suprise anyone homosexuality ha alway exist in all society it would be most unusual if the nazi be an exception no i do have any source for you a i think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citation from archival material and i do not have acces to these nor do i intend to reread every book on the nazi and on modern homosexuality that i have ever read i do have the time nothing be stop you however from chase down those source until you prove otherwise though i will stick with the establish history david matthew deane deane be in me a the eternal mood of the bleak wind let the god speak softly of u in day hereafter ezra pound
