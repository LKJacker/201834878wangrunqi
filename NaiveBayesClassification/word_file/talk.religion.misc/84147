subject re who next mormon and jew from casper c kny isscck isaac kuo saackuo write in article casper c kny isscck byuvm b gedaliah friedenberg friedenb write a a latter-day saint i find john statement not at all ludicrou please allow me to explain myself in the governor of missourus governor bogg issue hi so-called mormon extermination order the only crime illegal activity the latter-day saint have commit wa their religiou affiliation their anti-slave stance missourus still allow slave practice and their grow in missourus i gues the mormon get what they deserve because they refuse to bow to the will of corrupt and evil secular authority thi disobedience bring upon them persecution murder and finally force expulsion from their land and settlement it be significant to remember that these secular position be hold by average person and that at the time almost all american be pretty homogeonously christian it wa largely the mainstream christian disgust at such practice a polygamy which result in their irrational hatred true but that be exactly the problem the mormon extermination order wa issue not just by a christian it wa allowed under the constitution of the united state which wa institute precisely to prevent incident like thi order from occur in the first place a i indicate in an earlier post ymy irrational hatred be clearly evidence by individual like robert weis who could have be gov bogg lieutenant he would have fit right in drewling et al and seem a modern-day occurrence base on result slander persecution misrepresentation ly deny mormon representation in their own user group etc etc in intent and purpose what really ha change the situation be not entirely different today many irrational feel and belief be justify through religion i do think most of them be start because of religion but religion certainly help justify and perpetuate prejudice and practice by provide a neat justification which discourage critical think true a evidence by numerou example a i be sure you aware in any regard mormon history alone indicate that secular authority and i do even discus how uthan be suckered into allow part of their land in become nerve-ga and atomic bomb test grind be far from be trust or righteou have thing really change for the better i may be a bear cynic but i have no reason whatsoever that such ha be the case in the early i believe the late president kimball ld church leader strongly protest federal attempt to locate the mx peace keeper missile maze from be build in utah yet another inspire decision from secular authority fortunately hi opposition wa influential enough for the feed to back off do you mean that the secular authority be some continuou group of person with the common and uninterrupted goal of the mormon do you honestly believe that the main reason for use utah for nuclear test etc wa to get them thar mormon and what about the majority of uthan who be mormon you seem to be search for enemy correction the majority of utahn are mormon i believe up to a in many city and settlement throughout the western state conspiracy it be paranoid to believe that everything that affect you badly must have be do primarily for that purpose what i mean be that secular authority be to be watch a we believe that satan ha be give some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth judgment and justice in addition we believe that the adversary ha power to influence the unjust and idolatrou greed for money would be a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and evil combination a an intelligent be do you suppose that the destroyer would yield hi influence foremost on those with political power a far a utah be concern what i point out be some horrible example of environmental nightmare impose upon by secular authority which have bring death disease the downwinder and environmental contami nation i be hardly paranoid i be just not expect too much from a secular government that may not share my value and faith and which indeed a gov bogg et al may be out to harm and destroy u a a matter of fact prophecy in my church indicate that in future year global persecution against mormon will so increase in intensity and scope that paraphrase all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to zion zion the pure in heart will be re-established in those day and it ai my current secular authority who will rule over it david koresh do not pose a great threat to the federal authority or the security of thi nation and with john i too wonder who or what next i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who be a threat to the life of even one person sure he do not pose a threat to the security of thi nation but he do pose a threat to the life of hi follower that much be definite hmmm definite by whom until such ha be establish beyond reason able doubt thi allege threat may have be le than the threat impose upon him and hi follower by the batf and fbi who kill who what constitutional right do the atf officer have to invade upon private land and to force themself into the compound what really cause the murder of the little child could it be that the presence ha any bear upon the event how would you interpret the mt masada event blame the jew what the heck do the roman do there anyway what busines do the ha in waco texa the branch davidian never pose any threat to society thi be like ask who really cause the death of the israeli olympic team in in that case the polouse botch the job a well but to lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorist would be a terrible mistake i think the same sort of reason apply in thi case certainly if david koresh choose any peaceful option the atf and fbi would have comply the responsibility be more hi than the authority come now at issue be in how much the authority escalate an otherwise peaceful stand-off let get it over with and force david koresh to come out by gas them were they naive or what they play right into the hand of an apocalyptic-thinking individual he have prepare hi person for thi eventuality for year and not one firetruck or plan wa in place to deal with thi scenario i feel that the authority have some responsibility to protect their own citizen even if they be religiou zealot and guilty of not pay a gun license ha the batf become an extension of the local tax-collector david koresh no doubt will be describe a the evil guy by the executioner while the action of all those valiant and brave officer characterizing the a executioner be inaccurate and unfair in order to be an executioner the least one must have do be have the intent to kill que intrusion into private property with semi load with life ammunition be that implicit intent or at least prepare to kill i ask you would the batf warrant stand up in a civil court of justice i do not mind if criminal such a dangerou drug lord be bring to justice but escalate event to the point of allow to if not compli city with the destruction of a person isaac kuo isaackuo how lucky you english be to find the toilet so amuse o for u it be a mundane and functional item for you the basi of an entire culture manfred von
