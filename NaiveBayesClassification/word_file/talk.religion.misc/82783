from bobsarv bob sarver subject re question for those with popular morality hudson ye you do who be to say that it be immoral for onesself to experience pain or to be hurt in some other way maybe unpleasant but that do say anything about morality it violate free will hudson me you can derive the immorality of hurt someone else entirely from selfish motive i can say for example that it be wrong to hurt other person because that make them le productive member of society hudson why be make someone a le productive member of society immoral hudson you be screw up again morality do not i say again do not define only right and wrong it also define acceptable social behavior without any overtone of good and evil picking up ymy trash be not really a moral issue in the eternal sense of good and evil yet it be moral in the sense that it be acceptable social behavior ymy definition of the word morality be what be cause you to trip over yourself here me and since i selfish be that i be want to maximize my gain from society i will not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down on how much benefit i can derive from society hudson why be ymy benefit somehow relate to morality again ymy definition be cause you to shoot yourself in the foot hudson what about if someone feel that their own personal benefit be enhance more than it would be damage by deplete the overall resource of society maybe something might hurt society but it would help him immensly that be irrational think there may also be person out there who think that death by atomic destruction be a sublime and wonderful thing i be not go to let them execute that idea just because they want to do it simply because i let person make up their mind about what moral they have do prevent me from spot and stop a madman when i see one hudson and even then i will only stop him when he interfere with me and my life that be the difference between me and you you want to interfere in person life even when they be affect you hudson the central character in dostoevsky novel crime and punishment r something or other reason that if kill thi old jewish woman and steal her money to educate and establish himself financially he could make a great contribution to society he reason that she wa not of much profit to society she just collect rent and hoard money one of the central point of any that any moral system be that be ha to be internally consistent by kill her the character have to accept the premise that the end justify the mean if he accept that premise then in order to be consistent he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to hi life now if he be unwilling to accept thi premise which he will not be will to accept then he ha behave inconsistently with hi own moral standard me football example delete hudson now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the player in the the court be injure or kill thi freshman want to play in the big game so a talent scout can see him if he hurt a player on the team it might slightly lessen the chance of the team to win but he might gain great personal benefit so operate on purely selfish immorally selfish motive he arrange for a sniper to shoot a team player in the leg he get to play in front of the talent scout did that freshman behave morally selfish intention may sometime generate apparently moral action but not alway two problem right off the bat the problem with ymy analogy be that it do addres the goal that i start with win the game playing in front of the talent scout win the game try create the same analogy and keep the ultimate goal the same will you the internal consistency question be also not address if the freshman want to do thi to other person then he ha to accept the fact that it may happen to him one day if he be unwilling then he ha violate hi own moral standard
