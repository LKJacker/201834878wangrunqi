from emarsh eric marsh subject magick and parallel universe wa the universe and black hole in article nancus ann miller write emarsh eric marsh write btw the parallel universe approach imply an element of mind in the very physical reality of the universe thi sound interest but what exactly do you mean well the best thing to do be to read the book parallel universe by dr fred wolf in essence dr wolf say that one interpretation of the sub-atomic duality be that what we perceive a a wave be actually an infinate number of parallel universe overlay and in each of these universe there be a particle in a different location when we do something to make a particle appear we be actually cause all the parallel universe to collapse into one apparently thi be one line of think on the nature of qm that be go through some of the scientific community dr wolf and many other claim that somehow the collapse be cause by the mental effort of observe the particle thi imply that mind be more than merely a biological phenomenon he then extrapolate that if mind be an integral part of the universe then perhap consciousnes be the element that gife order and form to the universe s s it all get rather interest but what i find facinating be that thi would explain the phenomenon of magick a practice in my religion dr wolf speculate that the order functionality of mind could be cause by the selection of a future from an infinite number of possible future he say that thi might be do by some sort of communication between one current and possible future self i have long speculate that if magick be not merely a form of self delusion then perhap it could be cause by some sort of a selection of one of many possible future i realize that thi get pretty bizarre but it never hurt to keep an open mind and at least file it all away a another possibile explaination of the world in which we find ourself after all the more we learn about the universe in which we live the more we learn that it be truly a very strange place nancus eric
