from ml michael siemon subject commandment i the basic why should anyone check let restrict thi to christian why do we want to find commandment in the book regard a scripture what go on i will pa on psychologizing answer whether dismissive or more open a not the kind of issue to deal with here the question be what be the theological point involve and it ha be quote at me often enough by those who do believe i take it seriously that jesu be say to have say if you love me you will obey my command john i be like any christian the slave of christ and it be my will that i should do a he will me to do i be also or instead hi younger brother but still under hi direction though we both call god abba christian therefore will try to find what it be that their lord command them and discover it will feel obligate to do it or to confes their failure reader here may set aside the theologize jargon such a slave of christ the point be that adherent of a religion will read the text whether classify a inspire or not that be hold up a model in an effort to find application to their own situation thi practice range from devotional read of sermon and the like to the exegesi of canon ical scripture a the word of god and at the highest pitch thi lead to a question of whether we can find in inspire scripture something that can act a absolute guidance for my action the problem be in find out just what it be my lord command i be go to set aside for thi essay one major direction in which christian have look for these command namely christian tradition that be not because i reject tradition but because my primary audience in thi essay be protestant who deny tradition a determinative value in favor of the witnes of scripture the question i want to deal with be what commandment can we find from my lord in scripture and that turn out to be a hard question if any of my protestant inquisitor would like to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition i can accomodate them unlike most protestant episcopalian admit claim from a scripture b reason and c tradition on roughly equal stand earlier in john than my quote above we read john i give you a new commandment love one another thi be the only place in the nt where christian be give an explicit commandment with the context comment on it imperative mode pronouncement by jesu at the same meal so we reader infer since it be not in john but in the synoptic jesu say take thi bread thi be my body mark cf matthew luke corinthian the mode be imperative greek labete and hence thi too be a commandment in both case we have to infer that the command be direct to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciple because we judge the evangelist point in mention it with the disciple by then mostly or entirely dead be that we be expect to follow thi a a commandment from my lord in the case of communion paul mention at least thi be probably true of the evangelist also imply an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these word operate to bind christian to the original command to hi disciple a a continue commandment to the christian community i be entirely comfortable with thi inference but i must point out that it be there between u and the occasion on which jesu speak the command i take it a a clear inference at the very least the evangelist notion that all christian be call to love one another in jesu command direct at the disciple but i have to call attention to the inference the command can not apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of it statement to my own context a a disciple of christ all read of scripture ha to make such inference to get any sense out of the text whatsoever thi be a general problem in read these text we can not read them at all without my own understand of my native language in which we normally read the translate text and without some appreciation of the original context and at point the original language when english mislead u i be go to presume in what follow that we have the general problem of how to read scripture under control i do really think thi be true but it will suffice for my current purpose i will addres only the issue that arise when we have already cop with the understand of a year old text from another world than the one we live in question at that level only introduce more reser vation about the commandment issue than will be find stipulate that we can read the text a the original audience might have do among the reason we have for see john agapate allelou a a general commandment not merely an instruction by jesu to thi disciple on that one occasion and one link it to the synoptic great commandment be that we have criticism from jesu about limit my love to those whom we congenially associate with in matthew we read you have learn how it wa say must love ymy neighbor and hate ymy enemy but i say to you love ymy enemy in fact the leviticu context quote do not say ymy enemy it be merely the common human presumption and leviticu be at pain to say that the love should extend to stranger amongst the person of israel luke in expand on thi same q context go on to have jesu say even sinner love those who love them all of thi suggest quite strongly i say that limit the scope of the new commandment be not quite what jesu ha in mind in short inference lead me to generalize the actual text to a command that be in force on christian and with object not limit to other christian trickier than the agapate allelou or institution of communion there be the case of the great commission where matthew mark the twelve be send out to evangelize proclaim that the kingdom of heaven be close at hand the verb be imperative ke russete but the context be rather specific to the twelve and there be further specifier a in do not turn ymy step to pagan territory and do not enter any samaritan town the lukan parallel be even more specific to jesu final journey to jerusalem which make it harder to see thi generalize to all christian than the previou example that ha prevent christian from making such an inference what i have to call attention to be that such inference be not justify in the text nor unlike the first two case i cite by the rhetoric of the evangelist urge on the reader still paul seem to have felt oblige to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven be close at hand even contrary to jesu instruction to the to the gentile to the end of the earth so christian after him have also take thi a a commandment in the sense of john do i accept thi i do know it be surely rather speculative but you see how the ripple of inference spread out from the text that be the pretext christian may infer a general commandment applicable to all from what be present in the gospel a a specific occasion i do not necessarily object to thi kind of generalization but i insist that person who make it must have an understand that they be reason at some considerable length from what we actually have in scripture there be assumption involve in thi reason and these be not themself scriptural though person will do their best to justify their assumption by other reference to scripture which simply add more inference into the mix let move on to the great commandment that we should love god with my whole heart and mind and soul thi be perhap the synoptic equivalent of john agapate allelou and yet it be not presented a a commandment in my text rather the context be controversy with the pharisee to cite matthew but when the pharisee hear that he have silence the sadducee they get together and to disconcert him one of them put a question master which be the greatest commandment of the law it be by no mean obviou here though i accept it a such that jesu answer be mean to be a commandment to christian he be answer a polemic from hi enemy mark account in cast the answer in a far more positive light a so the scribe in thi version say far more important than any holocaust i need to point out that thi word originate in the context of animal sacrifice forget the nazi for thi or sacrifice luke be intermediate he ha a lawyer pose the question to disconcert jesu and get the good samarian parable for hi pain luke the context here be so confusingly variou that one could be forgive for draw no inference in no account be thi say a if it be obviously to be take a a commandment bind on christian though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that jesu think it to be so the point be that my mental gear have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of thi about what we be command to do by jesu and all of thi be contingent on my understand the point of jesu use of the torah in the all quite different gospel account and the application of such a context to u the different context among the synoptic be curiou it should be note that only in luke do we get the fix of thi command by the parable of the good samaritan we may look for an analogou intent in matthew where gife the golden rule a the mean of the law and the prophet and where we may also hear an echo of hillel say the same a generation before jesu if we make these association which i think be entirely reasonable we be again indulge in inference the text do not explicitly support u rather we read the text a have thi kind of inter-relationship current literary theory call thi intertextuality my discussion of why the agapate allelou ha to apply beyond the community of the disciple and beyound the circle of christian believer apply again here to buttres a conclusion that thi be despite the presentation not say so explicitly a commandment to christian few christian would disagree with my conclusion but i must point out that they be conclusion they depend on rather elaborate chain of reason that be simply not present in the text themself the contextual problem keep come up more and more severely a we look at those say of jesu that be not so universally take by christian a commandment and we get some really hard case take divorce mark be pretty clear the man who divorce hi wife and marry another be guilty of adultery against her cf luke except that matthew ha an escape clause except in the case of fornication thi seem to be a rather clear commandment whether or not we take matthew reservation and some christian to thi day take it so but some do at least in practice thi be rather peculiar it be not a if jesu be not explicit about thi wherea he say nothing at all about some of the thing person gnash their tooth over how be it possible if the command of christ be clear that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelist of the synoptic tradition i go to continue thi examination into ever-murkier water but thi be enough to start with the theme be find commandment in scripture be an exercise in inference my inference be inform by my assumption that be my own cultural bias i have so far identify a very few commandment that be generally accept by all christian and yet in these already some of the difficulty start to surface it be these difficulty i want to discus in my next essay on thi topic the divorce commandment already strike at some of the difficulty i see almost no evidence that the person who be so eager to find commandment to condemn me with spend any time at all write nasty screed to or about the horror or viciousnes of divorce or demand that u law refuse to allow it or refuse unrepentant divorcee place in their church that be not to say that divorce enter into consideration in general it be most definitely a matter of concern in even the most liberal church circle for example a wildly liberal episcopalian priest of my aqauintence in a wildly liberal diocese ha recommend to a couple who approach him to marry them that they have a private secular ceremony before a judge so that the public ceremony he celebrate need not go through an agonize examination by official who would just a soon not take on thi role of interpret the command we be face with a christian thi in a church that wa effectively created by a famou divorce michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you nevertheles or you shall die
