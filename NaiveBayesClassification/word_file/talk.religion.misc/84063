from tony alicea subject cecus rosicrucian adventure hello cecus my name be tony and i have a few comment on ymy rosicrucian adventure i hereby state that i be not claim or deny membership in any order fraternity etc with or without the word rosicrucian in the name of the organization i only claim have do some homework thi be intend a a friendly article and if at time it seem different it my lack of write skill show nothing else heck english may be my second language and then again maybe not by now i proceed i have an ehum interest experience with the rosicrucian or at least rosicrucian of some sort last sunday let start with the name rosicrucian i take me a long time to come to the conclusion that there be a difference between a member of a rosicrucian body and being a rosicrucian so when you say that you meet some you mean member of a group that call themself rosicrucian at least that be what ymy observation suggest i prefer if you would have state up front that it wa the lectorium rosicrucianum only because they may be confuse by some reader of thi newsgroup with the rosicrucian order amorc base the usa jurisdiction in san jose ca thi be the rc org with the most member last time i look of course most member do not necessarily mean best anyway the lectorium rosicrucianum claim they descend at least in part from what wa the gold-und-rosenkreuz golden and rosy cros from the century there be two golden and rosy cros the first chronologically more alchemical the second with masonic tinge but their history be the subject of a complete chapter you have to trust me when i tell you that if that have be present by amorc it be unlikely that you would have have the same impression you probably have have a positive impression more likely than a negative one imho the first guy also say that the r s be a mystical christian order and that they base their teach on the teach of the kathar english from the thirteenth century again instead of r s it should be lectorium rosicrucianum it be curiou to know that other rc in the usa claim to be non sectarian the cathar be a christian sect that directly challenge the of the medieval catholic church they flourish during the century century which saw the religiou zeal express in the crusade and also the grow disillusion with the catholic church and the worldly way of it cleric it wa largely in response to the church unseemly pomp and splendor that catharism take root first in northern italy then throughout the south of france what make me a bite suspiciou wa the way they first say that we all contain something divine and could find my way back to divinity then that we could become divine a the person we be currently but if we work really hard we would reach eternal blis i do see nothing fundamentally wrong with u contain something divine and ye i do like phrase like eternal blis either how to robotize person and brainwash for a moment i think you be refer to madison ave madison avenue in new york city be where the most influential read commercial advertise be produce here in the usa peace tony btw i have read the intro letter of the lrc which they will mail you free of charge
