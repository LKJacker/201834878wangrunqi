from hamilton bill hamilton subject re burden of proof in article cfaehl chri faehl write in article ray bill ray write note followup go to delete if i make a statement that god exist love me etc but in no way insist that you believe it do that place a burden of proof upon me if you insist that god do exist do that place a burden of proof upon you i give no proof i only give testimony to my belief i will respond to proof that you attempt to disprove my belief if you say x statement and give it the authority of fact i will respond by ask you why you be obligate to say anything but if ymy intent be to convince me that x statement be true then ye the burden of proof be upon you if what wa be discuss could be establish or disproven by experiment and observation then i would agree with you chri the burden of proof would belong to bill but the source document for christianity the bible simply assume god exist and make it clear to u calvinist anyway that when a person be in fellowship with god it be because god ha take the initiative in reveal himself to that person so from a christian point of view the burden of proof belong to god bill be be consistent with what the bible teach in relate hi own experience with god but it would be an error on hi part to assume that there be a direct causal relationship between hi testimony and someone else become convince that god exist and that he need to be reconcile to god if you be merely give testimony to ymy belief then you be an egotist please excuse me if i miss an earlier part of thi thread in which bill come acros like an egotist what i saw wa simply obedience to the scriptural command to alway be ready to give a reason for the joy that be in you bill hamilton
