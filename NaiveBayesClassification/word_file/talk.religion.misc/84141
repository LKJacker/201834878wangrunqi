from ml michael siemon subject re what part of no do you understand in e elizabeth bartley write i can certainly see oppose the aman but that do require oppose a moment of silence i already respond to thi on one dimension but afterthought cause me to make another independent reply the problem with a moment of silence be that it be not an even-handed way of allow for religion amongst student in the public school a i note before muslim need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayer they be require by muhammad to do and at least orthodox jewish prayer also ha requirement that be not address by thi there be in fact a highly selective bia toward christian prayer in thi moment of silence shit and that be especially bizarre in that christian prayer do need thi stuff a christain may pray totally incognito at any time to some extent thi be true of muslim and jew a well what i intend in my first paragraph be that there be some characteristic form of prayer in these religion which do need special time behavior which can not be undertake without an observer be able take note of it a christian may pray at any time silently and without any trace of hi activity be evident to other that may or may not be true of the other religiou tradition amongst u certainly these tend to have some form of prayer that would evidence difference from mainstream religion all that a moment of silence do be to allow that one tradition which do need it to have a special place set aside in the public school there be nothing in christian prayer that require public form or rug or phylactery or anything else at all visible to the outside world a christian student may and probably do pray at innumerable time during the day without anyone else know it that may also be true of non christian i be not claimng otherwise in the moment of silence it would still be difficult for the jew to gather and daven for the muslim to do their ablution and find qiblah to mecca and engage in the prescribe form but of course christian can do their thing and therefore the provision be nothing but a disguise attempt to encourage just that luckily there be a strong jewish presence in thi country and i a a christian revere some of the jewish teacher i have in public school and a grow muslim presence a well i can only hope that the political force consequent on thi will prevent the imposition of christian form on non-christian a far a i can see a a christian there be nothing in thi moment of silence campaign but an attempt to use public social pressure to force child to adhere to a pattern that be bias toward christianity and a a christian i must protest such coercion for what it worth i suspect that the coercion be not really target at the non-christian it be yet another case of failure amongst christian parent in make their child prayerful so that they want the public school to teach what they can not manage to teach despite have all the opportunity in the world to do so if you have teach ymy child to pray they do not need a moment of silence in school if you have not manage to teach them the moment will only embarras you give it up michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you nevertheles or you shall die like man and fall ml like any prince psalm
