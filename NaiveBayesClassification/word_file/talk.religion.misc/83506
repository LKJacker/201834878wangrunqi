from thyagi thyagi morgoth nagasiva subject re oto the ancient order of oriental templar do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law honestly the word of sin be restriction would i kid you do one man word encompas the majestic vision of thousand of individual quoting a man be not the same a quote the order taken out of context word can be interpret much differently than have one apply them within the confine of their original expression i think thi be the case regard hymenaeu betum frater superior of the order to which i belong when he include that bite from merlinu x he do u all a service he show u the extreme to which order member have be know to go in their fervor i have little knowledge regard reus background but surely he wa an unusual man and he wa an important force in the order for many year yet a person change so do order change and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of remember that thi be only the surface skim and that many perspective be now encompass which extend beyond any one individual i hope to show that there wa and be much room for a difference of opinion within the order itself perhap by test the limit myself let u examine thi issue a bite more closely in karl kellner a wealthy austrian industrialist and paper chemist a well a a high-grade mason found the ordo templi orienti kellner have travel widely in the east where he meet three adept who instruct him specific magical practice kellner effort to develop the order be later assist by franz hartmann heinrich klein and theodore reus who have work together prior to join the the order wa first proclaim in in reus masonic publication on kellner death reus succeed him a outer head the edition of the publish in announce that the order teach secret of sexual magic theodore reus wa an interest character born june in augsburg he enter masonry in he wa a singer journalist and possibly a spy for the prussian political polouse infiltrate the socialist league found by karl marx daughter and her husband reus wa later associate with william wynn westcott a leader of the golden dawn who later introduce him to john yarker yarker charter reus to find the rite of memphi and mizraim in germany after several attempt to concretize variou masonic rite reus settle on the development of the the order experience reasonably steady growth under reus leadership for example he charter papu in france rudolph steiner in berlin and h spencer lewi in the usa in the historic meet between reus and crowley occur crowley write that reus come to him and accuse him of reveal order secret when crowley look at it afresh the initiate interpretation of sexual magick unfold itself to him for the first time reus appoint crowley a supreme and holy king of all the english speak world and it wa thi authorization that he invoke when publish the material of the equinox reus resign a outer head of the order in after suffer a stroke and name crowley hi successor all wa well until when the book of the law wa translate into german there wa a break in the continuity of the order manyk member split with the new over the book which crowley wa actively promulgate through the order he have earlier revise dthe order ritual at reus request deeply infuse the doctrine of the new aeon revelation an introduction to the history of the by ad veritatem ix within equinox edited by hymenaeu betum frater superior rex summu sanctissimu caliph of the united state of america published by samuel weiser there be many possible reason that my frater superior include thi material in equinox and thi be the real point be it not why do he wish to publish such thing about the history of hi own organization do he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of thelema or be he exercise hi true will and put forth very complex picture with no easy answer a picture which leaf room for very many interpretation it be quite easy for me to see for example that all of derive out of the dribble of falter masonry purchase by clever huckster with an ounce of courage and some write ability to aid them and i can take that all the way down to my present caliph whose feeble support of the of thelema be laughable at best would i be throw out of the order for speak in thi way will i i think not why because my frater will see it a a perspective an interjection i be use a an example my illustration show that we may expres thing in the context of a larger work and the true significance of thi may be quite difficult to apprehend at first so it may be with oto and merlinu x please look more carefully i do not support reus word myself a i be not qualify to ass them and i be critical of their pomposity if i who be a member of the order take such a stand and be allow to continue do so then what can thi say about the health of the order do it mean that the order ha soft and abandon it moral principle or do it mean that it be strong in it ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on it own not shackle by some dogmatic requirement how shall we resolve these two possibility i find a high calibre of individual associate with ordo templi orienti they be often quite intelligent and sometime very well verse in arcane or usual information they be quite often artist and geniuse having meet some longstanding member in the sf bay area many who be or be very heavily involve with the order i can vouch for the integrity of the organization a it stand i have sometime question the policy of hymenaeu betum in these moment i follow my intuition and i find little to stop me from request a second initiation from a different body i happily participate in social group feast or initiation and have come to know the gnostic mas well enough for my taste thi do make me an authority on order politic and explanation however i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand base on my limit contact with other member i urge you not to take the word of merlinu x too far there be many way to interpret word and many person who have become involve with the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision i welcome other comment on thi issue and will be write more in response to other post in thi thread invoke me under my star love be the law love under will i be i frater i nigri dclxvus cccxxxiius
