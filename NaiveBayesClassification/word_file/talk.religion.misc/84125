from tim tim scott subject re rfd in article thyagi thyagi morgoth nagasiva write i would like to add my support for a discussion group i applaud the enthusiam show by the person post thyagi i read in but i differ with in believe that at least some minimal parameter should be agree upon thyagi write i recommend that the depth of generality indeed of ambiguity in thi newsgroup be maximize calling the tradition old or new be rather unnecessary and only lead to foolish squabble there be no doubt that nature be a splendid teacher whether she appear in the word speak by a tree or by a stream a microbe or a star let u not limit to but if we do limit it to something the discussion degenerate into a big amorphou glob other question thyagi propose be what be thi proces of reality why be taoism base upon an assumption why do thi assumption concern knowledge and what can be know what be the value of not know what be tao what do it mean to be it seem to me that these question more properly fall into the category of general metaphysic i would prefer any to deal more closely with topic and work more closely associate with at least semi-orthodox taoism with establish classic work definitely include and work like mantak chium argue about i think neo-taoism should be exclude or get it own group what i mean by thi be humpty-dumpty taoism in which taoism mean whatever a poster say it mean thi could also be a refuge for debate about what taoism really mean or speculation on sexual alchemy etc from thyagi again taoism do what the hell it want i tell you taoism do exist be no more real that decide now real or not real exist or not-exist when shall we be certain kent gloomily predict quote from thyagi article however most traffic in the group will likely concern the philosophical secular taoism aver by alan watt and niel bohr and yogic taoism a it pertain to medical sexual and martial technique i think that discussion of thi nature be not completely out of place what happen be that that the term taoism be become completely pollute and trivialize like the word magic alchemy zen etc by writer appropriate the word to mean whatever they want thi be see by the spate of new age book entitle the tao of thi that and everything else with respect to some exception like the book by jou tsung-hwa any other i look forward to see them on balance i say let rip and let the chip fall where they may if it just get fill up with college freshman ask about the tao of sex then it will have be a failure and person will post to these group just a they do now tim p scott send from megatek corporation scranton rd san diego ca usa fax internet tim or uunet megatek tim
