from edgar pearlstein subject waco information accuracy it should be remember that all of the first report come from the fbi and that independent observer the pres be not allow to get close and see thing for themself official communique tend to be self-serving for the agency that issue them person in general tend to believe first report a these get the most and the biggest headline correction be often overlook an example be the fbi report that several of the body find in the rubble have bullet wind the local coroner who be independent of the fbi ha so far find no bullet wind
