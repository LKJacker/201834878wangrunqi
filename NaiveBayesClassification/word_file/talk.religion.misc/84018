from stephen subject re biblical backing of koresh tape cite enclose in article netd write name stephen write for those who think david koresh do have a solid structure or sound biblical back for hi hmy long tape broadcast i do think anyone really care about the solid structure of hi sermon other than it tell quite a lot about the man himself it the death he responsible for that concern most person are you the spokesman for most person i enclose a partial list of the source he cite or quote he exactly use a a christian sermon it pretty good if not inspire though i differ in part on some of hi conclusion the argument he present be well back which be why it take me thi long to work through still ongoing if you think it wa ramble that say far more about you than it do koresh you make me curiou what do thi say about me that you do recognize the biblical commentary use those in the church know the language though and have no such excuse first seal in revelation the entirety of psalm and the most of revelation which demonstrate one of hi major point about how the write in the prophet include david and in the psalm and in revelation be all tell the same story when you understand how they relate ie have the key they largely explain each other charle manson use revelation a well do we see a pattern here i wonder if koresh like the beatle you miss the point which be that the prophet the psalm and revelation all together provide a very rich view of a very special event a wed koresh wa a nut okay just because he find way for the bible to backup hi rant do not make him any le of a kook how be you able to make such a conclusion please note that the first part of revelation make it clear that the addres be to those in the church that say it do hurt to try to see what the prophecy be ahead of time for those outside the church seem to me koresh be yet another messenger that get kill for the message he carry i type thi very slowly so that you can understand he either set the fire himself or tell hi follower to do so do make him out to be a martyr he do not get kill he kill himself so you say it should be interest to see what the investigator conclude and what the final judgment be in the mean time we sure learn a lot about evil and corruption are you surprise thing have get that rotten the evil wa inside the compound all that thou shalt not kill stuff so much for war and government eh oh yeah one last point for the believer philippian for the rest of u could you please post the text very glad you ask since i goof it should be philippian here from niv because of my chain most of the brother in the lord have be encourage to speak the word of god more courageously and fearlessly it be true that some preach christ out of envy and rivalry but other out of good will the latter do so in love know that i be put here for the gospel the former preach christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely suppose that they can stir up trouble for me while i be chain but what do it matter the important thing be that in every way whether from false motive or true christ be preach and because of thi i rejoice my comment stem from the realization that we who love the lord be human and imperfect whatever we preach no matter how eloquent or how corrupt be of little difference those who know the master voice will recognize him a gem-stone amidst rock such be also the lesson of the stumblingblock for those who have an ear to hear j stephen
