from mcelwre subject larsonian astronomy physic creation the follow partial summary of a theory of the universe include a little-known description of the creation of my solar system larsonian astronomy and physic orthodox physicist astronomer and astrophysicist claim to be look for a unified field theory in which all of the force of the universe can be explain with a single set of law or equation but they have be systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for year the late physicist dewey b larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he call the reciprocal system be build on two fundamental postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time the physical universe be compose entirely of one component motion exist in three dimension in discrete unit and in two reciprocal form space and time the physical universe conform to the relation of ordinary commutative mathematics it magnitude be absolute and it geometry be euclidean from these two postulate larson develop a complete theoretical universe use variou combination of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational rotational motion the concept of in-ward and out-ward scalar motion and speed in relation to the speed of light which larson call unit velocity and the natural datum at each step in the development larson wa able to match object in hi theoretical universe with object in the real physical universe photon sub-atomic particle incomplete atom charge atom molecule globular star cluster galaxy binary star system solar system white dwarf star pulsar quasar etc even object not yet discovered then such a exploding galaxy and gamma-ray burst and apply hi theory to hi new model of the atom larson wa able to precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distance in crystal and molecule compressibility and thermal expansion of solid and other property of matter all of thi be describe in good detail with-out fancy complex mathematics in hi book book of dewey b larson the follow be a complete list of the late physicist dewey b larson book about hi comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe some of the early book be out of print now but still available through inter-library loan the structure of the physical universe the case against the nuclear atom beyond newton new light on space and time quasar and pulsar nothing but motion a substitute for the billion super collider the last fmy chapter explain chemical bond the neglected fact of science the universe of motion final solution to most all astrophysical mystery basic property of matter all but the last of these book be publish by north pacific publisher box portland or and should be available vium inter-library loan if ymy local university or public library do have each of them several of them including the last one be available from the international society of unified science isu e atkin ave salt lake city utah thi be the organization that wa start to promote larson theory they have other relate publication include the quarterly journal reciprocity physicist dewey b larson background physicist dewey b larson wa a retire engineer chemical or electrical he wa about year old when he die in may he have a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he develop hi comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while try to develop a way to compute chemical property base only on the element use larson lack of a fancy degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist be ignore him but it be not a valid reason sometime it take a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the tree at the same time it be clear from hi book that he also know orthodox physic and astronomy a well a any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradiction ad hoc assumption principle of impotence in-consistency etc larson do not have the fund etc to experimentally test hi theory and it wa not necessary for him to do so he simply compare the variou part of hi theory with other researcher experimental and observational datum and in many case hi explanation fit better a self-consistent theory be much more than the orthodox physicist and astronomer have they claim to be look for a unify field theory that work but have be ignoring one for over year now modern physic do not explain the physical universe so well some part of some of larson book be full of quotation of lead orthodox physicist and astronomer who agree and remember that epicycle crystal sphere geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed to explain it well but be later prove conceptually wrong prof frank h meyer professor emeritu of uw-superior a strong proponent of larson theory and wa or still be president of larson organization the international society of unified science and editor of their quarterly journal reciprocity he move to minneapoli after retire super collider boondoggle i be against contruction of the superconducting super collider in texa or anywhere else it would be a gros waste of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value most physicist do realize it but accord to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b larson a describe in hi book the strange goofy particle meson hyperon alleged quark etc which they be find in existing collider fermi lab cern etc be really just atom of anti-matter which be created by the high-energy collide beam and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they be incompatible with their environment a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more element of anti-matter that the physicist have not see there before and the physicist will be even more confused than they are now are a few more type of anti-matter atom worth the billion cost do we have much more important use for thi wasted money another thing to consider be that the primary propose location in texa ha a seriou and grow problem with some kind of fire ant eat the insulation off underground cable how much poisoning of the grind and grind water with insecticide will be require to keep the ant out of the supercollider naming the super collider after ronald reagon a propose be totally absurd if it be build it should be name after a lead particle physicist larsonian anti-matter in larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti-matter be not a simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle it ha more to do with the rate of vibration and rotation of the photon of which they be make in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light which larson call unit velocity and the natural datum in larson theory a positron be actually a particle of matter not anti-matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibration charge and rotation of their respective photon of which they be make neutralize each other in larson theory the anti-matter half of the physical universe ha three dimension of time and only one dimension of space and exist in a reciprocal relationship to my material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury ha be observe and precisely measure to advance at the rate of second of arc per century second of thi advance be attribute vium calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet venu earth jupiter etc the remain second of arc be be use to help prove einstein general theory of relativity but the late physicist dewey b larson achieve result closer to the second than general relativity can by instead use special relativity in one or more of hi book he apply the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally rejected general relativity a another mathematical fantasy he also rejected most of special relativity include the part about ma increase near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shift those quasar with red-shift greater than really are moving faster than the speed of light although most of that motion be away from u in time in larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there be three dimension of time instead of only one but two of those dimension can not be measure from my material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure be the clock time at low relative speed the value of the other two dimension be negligible but at high speed they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be use a a fudge factor larson often use the term coordinate time when write about thi in regard to ma increase it ha be proven in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration be acceleration force mas a orthodox physicist be ignoring the third factor force in larson theory ma stay constant and force drop toward zero force be actually a motion or combination of motion or relation between motion include inward and outward scalar motion the expansion of the universe for example be an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so-called big bang which be yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey b larson north pacific publisher box portland oregon page index hardcover it contain the astrophysical portion of a general unified theory of the physical universe develop by that author an unrecognized geniu more than thirty year ago it contain final solution to most all astrophysical mystery include the formation of galaxy binary and multiple star system and solar system the true origin of the background radiation cosmic ray and gamma ray burst and the true nature of quasar pulsar white dwarf explode galaxy etc it contain what astronomer and astrophysicist be all look for if they be ready to seriously consider it with open mind the follow be an example of hi theory succes in hi first book in the structure of the physical universe larson predict the existence of exploding galaxy several year before astronomer start find them they be a necessary consequence of larson comprehensive theory and when quasar be discover he have an immediate relate explanation for them also gamma-ray burst astro-physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about the mysteriou gamma-ray burst they be originally think to originate from neutron star in the disc of my galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit ha be detect them in all direction uniformly and their source location in space do not correspond to any know object except for a few case of directional coincidence gamma-ray burst be a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe develop by the late physicist dewey b larson according to page of hi book the universe of motion publish in the gamma-ray burst be come from supernova explosion in the anti-matter half of the physical universe which larson call the cosmic sector because of the relationship between the anti-matter and material half of the physical universe and the way they be connect together the gamma-ray burst can pop into my material half anywhere in space seemingly at random thi be why the source location of the burst do not correspond with know object and come from all direction uniformly i wonder how close to u in space a source location would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhap some of the mas extinction of the past which be now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid be actually cause by nearby gamma-ray burst larsonian binary star formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun be binary or double but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there be so many of them but binary star system be actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe develop by the late physicist dewey b larson i will try to summarize larson explanation which be detail in chapter of hi book the universe of motion and in some of hi other book first of all accord to larson star do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse the rest result from the complete annihilation of heavy element heavier than iron each element ha a destructive temperature limit the heavier the element be the lower be thi limit a star internal temperature increase a it grow in ma vium accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray gradually reach the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter element when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of iron there be a type i supernova explosion thi be because there be so much iron present and that be relate to the structure of iron atom and the atom build proces which larson explain in some of hi book better than i can when the star explode the lighter material on the outer portion of the star be blow outward in space at le than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star wa already bounce around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion push that material over the speed of light and it expand outward in time which be equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappear for a while over long period of time both mass start to fall back gravitationally the material that have be blow outward in space now start to form a red giant star the material that have be blow outward in time start to form a white dwarf star both star then start move back toward the main sequence from opposite direction on the h-r diagram the chance of the two mass fall back into the exact same location in space make a single lone star again be near zero they will instead form a binary system orbit each other according to larson a white dwarf star ha an inverse density gradient be densest at it surface because the material at it center be most widely disperse blow outward in time thi eliminate the need to resort to mathematical fantasy about degenerate matter neutron star black hole etc larsonian solar system formation if the ma of the heavy material at the center of the explode star be relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf star revolve around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three-dimensional time to be affect by it heat etc these will become planet in chapter of the universe of motion larson use all thi information and other principle of hi comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive hi own version of bode law black hole fantasy i hear that physicist stephen w hawking recently complete a theoretical mathematical analysi of two black hole merge together into a single black hole and conclude that the new black hole would have more mas than the sum of the two original black hole such a result should be recognize by everyone a a red flag cause widespread doubt about the whole idea of black hole etc after read physicist dewey b larson book about hi comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially hi book the universe of motion it be clear to me that black hole be nothing more than mathematical fantasy the strange object at cygnu be just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want to prove their theory by the way i do not understand why so much publicity be be give to physicist stephen hawking the physicist and astronomer seem to be act a if hawking severe physical problem somehow make him wiser it do not i wish the same attention have be give to physicist dewey b larson while he wa still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be give to larson theory book and organization the international society of unified science electro-magnetic propulsion i hear of that concept many year ago in connection with ufo and unorthodox inventor but i never wa able to find out how or why they work or how they be construct i find a possible clue about why they might work on page of the book basic property of matter by the late physicist dewey b larson which describe part of larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe i quote one paragraph a indicate in the precede chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrife at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electron we find be derive from the environment it wa bring out in volume i larson book nothing but motion that there be physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity and that although the motion that constitute these electron be in many case absorb by atomic structure the opportunity for utilize thi type of motion in such structure be limit it follow that there be alway a large exces of free electron in the material sector material half of the universe most of which be uncharged in thi uncharged state the electron can not move with respect to extension space because they be inherently rotate unit of space and the relation of space to space be not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remain permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon be carry outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregate be thu expose to a flux of electron similar to the continual bombardment by photon of radiation meanwhile there be other process to be discuss later whereby electron be return to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such a the earth therefore stabilize at an equilibrium level note that in larson theory uncharged electron be also massles and be basically photon of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spin around one axi at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity be the speed of light and there be vibrational and rotational equivalent to the speed of light accord to larson theory i might have the above and below label mix up larson be say that outer space be fill with ma les un-charged electron fly around at the speed of light if thi be true then the electro-magnetic propulsion field of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electron or other particle in space perhap giving them a charge and ma and shoot them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson theory an electrical charge be a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimpose on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quote above might also give a clue to confuse meteorologist about how and why lightning be generate in cloud suppression of larsonian physic the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe develop by the late physicist dewey b larson ha be available for more than year publish in in hi first book the structure of the physical universe it be totally un-scientific for hawking wheeler sagan and the other sacred priest of the religion they call science or physic or astronomy etc a well a the scientific literature and the education system to totally ignore larson theory ha they have larson theory ha excellent explanation for many thing now puzzle orthodox physicist and astronomer such a gamma-ray burst and the nature of quasar larson theory deserve to be honestly and openly discuss in the physic chemistry and astronomy journal in the and elsewhere and at least the basic principle of larson theory should be include in all relate course at uw-ec uw-madison cambridge cornell university and elsewhere so that student be not keep in the dark about a worthy alternative to the dogma they be be feed for more information answer to ymy question etc please consult my cited source especially larson book un-altered reproduction and dissemination of thi important partial summary be encouraged robert e mcelwaine physic and astronomy uw-ec
