cleaver use of editting can create any image one want to portray rather becaseu we be familium familiar with how widely it wa actively distribute and how many naive person be actually believe the garbage find within it the truth be that neither you nor i can fully speak for anyone who call themself gay but know a many a i do and know their testimoney and witness thier faith and life i have to say that the report you post be a very bias report something obviously claim against gay a well the truth be that unles you be innately gay you can not know what harm you be cause i speak a an abolitionist who support affirm gay right in my society i do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentation perpetrate by christian fundamentalist extremist but i know person who be not the

church and close the ministry door i convince myself that there be no need in the world for ex-gay person he say today caligiurus be study alternative spirituality i interest ed in belief system that be judgemental consider romance but not with a christian and search for a new project to devote himself to i feel compel to commit myself to gay cause he say i want to eventually stop feel guilty about what i do and make up for the damage i may have bring to my community end article caligiurus tory be by no mean unique and i have read several other article of former leader and founder of ministry who have say very similar th similar thing fortuantely not all of them have leave christianity but have come to realize that god love them despite the attitude of other some like chri glaser director of the presbyterian lazaru project of west hollywood presbyterian church have actually be work with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encourage real ethical value of sexuality within the sphere of be gay i have also a i say talk and become and become close friend with many who once attend such group a love in action and other who either once claim to have be reform or who be too honest with themself to live a lie no matter who wa disappoint in them some be even encourage to marry a a way of seal their new heterosexuality only to eventually start hit the bar bathhouse and bookstore since these be usually activity under the concealment of night and one-night-stand of promiscuou behavior mean no continuou sin through a commit relationship thi be a horrible trap which the church ha dump on the back of the truly gay orient person and the very inno cent victim in these case be the wife and child of such marriage yet the church insist that there be only two option they be will to allow gay person heterosexuality or celebacy thi be sad what be also mrtifying be in the case of those who can not suppres their desire and fear for thier sanity in such a mix up confusion that the church force on them they may even opt for or surgical dampering of the brain function in the past lobotomy and heavey drug suppressant be common place there be now become available more and more literature on the threat of coercive christianity toward gay such a sylvium pennington ex-gay there are none and other there be also a great many fact base book be write to help person trap in thi confusion such a maury johnston gay under grace and chri glaser come hom i seriously recommend those for person seek help for thi persecution and self-acceptance thank you
