from nancus ann miller subject re theist and objectivity trajan stephen mcintyre write can a theist be truly objective can he be impartial when question the truth of hi scripture or will he assume the superstition of hi parent when question i think that if a theist be truly objective and throw out the notion that god definitely exist and start from scratch to prove to themself that the scripture be the whole truth then that person would no longer be a theist it usually all ha to do with how the child be bring up from the time he be bear the theist be bring up with the notion of the truth of some kind of scripture the bible the torah the etc he be tell of thi wondrou god who write or inspire the scripture of the prophet talk about in the scripture of the miracle perform etc he be also tell that to question thi a child be apt to do be a sin a crime against god and to lose belief in the scrip ture truth be to damn one soul to hell thu by the time he be able to read the scripture for himself the belief in it truth be so ingrain in hi mind it all seem a matter of course you miss something here there be person who convert from non-theism to theism after be bring up in a non-theist household i do have any statistic a to how many though that would be an interest thing to know i think that religion be a crutch person be naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable person do want to believe that when they die they be dead finish that there be nothing else after that and so religion be kind of a nice fantasy religion also describe thing we do know about the universe thing science ha not yet describe and it also gife person a feel of security that if they just do thi one thing and everything will be ok that they be be watch over by a higher power and it minion thi ha a very high psychological attraction for quite a few person and these person be will to put up with a few discrepancy and hole in their belief system for what it gain them thi be why i think it kind of useles to try too hard to convert theist to atheism they be happy with their fantasy and they feel that other person will be happy with it too they ca accept the fact that there be person who would rather accept the harsh reality that they be run from anyway i get kind of carry away here but my point be that theism do have to be ingrain into a child mindset for that person to grow up a a theist although thi happen far too often theism be design to have it own attraction atheist libertarian pro-individuality pro-responsibility jr and all that jazz nancus if you know and be sure of the author of thi quote please send me email if you be one in a million then there be and a half of you in nyc
