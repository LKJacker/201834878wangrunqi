from bgarwood bob garwood subject re who next mormon and jew in article hil isaackuo isaac kuo write in article goykhman red herring write the fbi claim on the basi of their intelligence report that bd have no plan to commit suecide they btw have bug the place and be listen to bd conversation till the very end koresh attorney claim that base on some hour he spend talk to hi client and other in the compound he saw no indication that bd be contemplate suecide the survivor claim it wa not a suecide it not clear that more than one of the survivor make thi claim it be clear that at least one of the survivor make the contradictory claim that bd member have start the fire no thi be far from clear we only have the word of the fbi spokeperson that a survivor make thi claim we have the contradictory word of the lawyer who speak with the survivor individually that all of them agree that they do not have a suicide pact and do not intentionally start the fire in the absense of any more evidence i do see how we can decide who to believe furthermore it quite possible that there wa no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle take it upon themself to kill everyone else with the state of the area now we may never know what happen bd be not contemplate suecide and there be no reason to believe they commit one no reason how about these two some of the survivor claim that bd member pour fuel along the corridor and set fire to it the speed at which the fire spread be not inconsistent with thi claim again we have only the word of the fbi on thi claim the lawyer who have also talk to the survor deny that any of them be make that claim there wa certainly a fire which kill most of the person in the compound there be a very very good possibility that the fbi do not start thi fire thi be a good reason to believe that the bd do i will agree on ymy assessment a to the relative probability it more likely that the bd start the fire than do the fbi but there be currently no way to decide what actually happen base on the publically available evidence which be nearly none even if the bd be not contemplate suicide it be very possible that david koresh wa convince and thu convince the other that thi wa not suicide it wa the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort there be three possibility other than the bd self destruction a they be not dead but escape vium bunker etc from report of the inadequacy of the tunnel and the body find i would rate thi a highly unlikely b the fire wa start by an fbi accident thi be possible but it would be foolish of u to declare thi outright until more evidence can back it sure it possible that the armor vehicle knock down a lantern which start the fire why wa there a light lantern in the middle of the day near the edge of the complex it anecdotal evidence that ha be contradict by other escapee c the fire wa start on purpose by the fbi thi ha be suggest by some on the net and i would rate thi possibility a utterly ludicrou thi be what we in would call an extraordinary claim and wo bother refute unles someone gife any good evidence to back it up d the fire wa an start accidentally by the bd i be truely amaze that i have hear or read of no one suggest thi possibility with all the tear ga and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adult wear ga mask it have to have be chaotic inside i can easily image someone leave a lamp too close to something or accidentally drop a lamp or knock one over with the wind it would have quickly get out of control so we be leave with two reasonable possibility that the fire wa an fbi accident and that the fire wa start by the bd i find the latter more likely base on the evidence i see so far no i think that d be also quite reasonable i personally ca really as any relative probablity to either of these probability although if force to bet on the issue i would probably take an accident either fbi or bd over intential set of the fire i would also like to add a comment relate to the report that body recover have gunshot wind the coroner wa on the today show thi morning and categorically deny that they reach any such conclusion he point out that under intense heat sufficient pressure build up in the head that can cause it to explode and that thi can look very much like a massive gunshot wind to the head which be quite consist with te report i read and hear in short there be almost no evidence corroborate any of the many scenario a to what happen on monday we should remain skeptical until more information be available isaac kuo isaackuo o twinkle twinkle little sig keep it le than line big bob garwood
