from bobsarv bob sarver subject re question for those with popular morality in article bobsarv bob sarver write understand what the word mean someone who inflict pain on themself because they enjoy it be a masochist and no there be nothing wrong with it you may think it gros or bizarre and i might agree with you here but disgust be not equal to it be morally wrong hudson if someone inflict pain on themself whether they enjoy it or not they be hurt themself they may be permanently damage their body that be true it be also none of ymy busines some person may also reason that by read the bible and be a xtian you be permanently damage ymy brain by ymy logic it would be ok for them to come into ymy home take away ymy bible and send you off to re-education camp to save ymy mind from ruin are you ready for that hudson and why be there nothing wrong with it because you say so who give you the authority to say that and set the standard for morality why because i be a live think person able to make choice for myself i do not need you to show me what you think be the way i have observe too many error in ymy think already to trust you to make up the rule for me because i set the standard for my own morality and i permit you to do the same for yourself i also do not try to force you to accept my rule because simply because you do like what other person be do do give you the right to stop it hudson we be all aware that you would like for everyone to be like you however it be obnoxiou arrogant think like your the bullshit that ha bring u religiou war pogrom against jew gay-bashing and other atrocity by other person who like you know they be morally right me what be it with you hudson you think you know better than other person so you want to be able to tell them what they can and can not do to themself who die and make you god how come i ca do the same thing hudson are you are you indicate that i should not tell other person what to do are you tell me it be wrong for me to do that it be not a moral standard that i be present you with hudson it be a key to get along in life with other person it be also a point of respect i trust other person to be intelligent enough to make their own choice and i expect the same to be return you on the other hand do not trust them and want to make the choice for them whether they like it or not it be also a way to avoid an inconsistency if you believe that you have the right to set moral standard for other and interfere in their life then you must by logic admit that other person have the same right of interference in ymy life ye i know you will say that ymy religion be correct and tell you that only agent act in behalf of ymy religion have the right of interference however other person will say that you have misinterpret the word of god and that they be the actual true believer and that you be act on ymy own authority and so it go hudson who give you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that i can not set a moral standard for other you can set all the standard that you want actually but do be surprise if person do follow you like rat after the pied piper at the most basic form i be not go to let you tell me what to do and if necessary i will beat you to a bloody pulp before i let you actually interfere in my life now at a more humane level than that i recognize that all person be sentient be possess of intelligence and capable of reason i also recognize that they like i appreciate be treat with respect and allow to make their own decision
