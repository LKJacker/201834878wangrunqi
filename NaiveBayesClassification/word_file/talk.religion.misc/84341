from mathew mathew subject re after year can we say that christian morality be markp avignon mark pundur write mathew mathew write markp mark pundur write in mathew mathew write there no objective physic einstein and bohr have tell u that speaking a one who know relativity and quantum mechanic i say bullshit speaking a someone who also know relativity and quantum mechanic i say go ahead punk make my day my degree can beat up ymy degree ok refer u to the place in einstein or bohr write where he say no objective physic ah you take everything a literal quotation no wonder you confuse first can i ask that we decide on a definition of objective there no objective reality lsd should be sufficient to prove that speaking a one who ha take lsd i say bullshit well i have to bow to ymy superior knowledge on that one but i think i detect a pattern in ymy response how about some actual support for ymy dismissal you take lsd and it skew ymy perception of reality you come down and ymy perception unskew and how could strive toward an ideal be in any way useful if the ideal have no objective existence a perfectly efficient power station would convert all of the energy in coal into electricity there be absolutely no way we can build a perfect power station it an ideal but strive toward that ideal be undeniably useful and valuable be it not ok let me narrow the question is it useful to strive toward a nonexistent objective ethic i gues that it might be in what way it may be the case that some person be unable to evaluate complex moral issue rather than leave them to behave immorally it might be better to offer them an abstract nonexistent objective system of ethic which they can strive toward cod into rule which they do have to derive for themself i tend to feel that thi be pretty much what we all have a morality anyway mathew
