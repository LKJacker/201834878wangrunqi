from jon c r bennett subject idea on clipper i have an idea a to why the encryption algorithm need to be keep secret and some thing that i think it imply of course these could all be wrong from the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning revised april the clipper chip contain a classify single-key block encryption algorithm call skipjack the algorithm use bite key compare with for the de and ha round of scramble compare with for the de it support all de mode of operation the algorithm take clock tick and in electronic codebook ecb mode run at mbit per second each chip include the follow component the skipjack encryption algorithm f an family key that be common to all chip n a serial number thi length be subject to change u an secret key that unlock all message encrypt with the chip encrypting with the chip to see how the chip be use imagine that it be embed in the at t telephone security device a it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after push a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an session key k with the device at the other end thi key negotiation take place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be use such a the diffie-hellman public-key distribution method once the session key k be establish the clipper chip be use to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitize voice the telephone security device fee k and m into the chip to produce two value e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which be transmit over the telephone line the law enforcement field thu contain the session key k encrypt under the unit key u concatenate with the serial number n all encrypt under the family key f the law enforcement field be decrypt by law enforcement after an authorize wiretap ha be instal suppose i know how the algorithm work and know the n for my chip but do not know f then by cryptanalysi i might be able to determine f from if law enforcement field e e k u n f not know n would might make thi much harder now suppose that i know f either legitimately or not if i know k either because i be involve in the conversation or i know u for a party in the conversation i may now be able to determine u for the other party if i know f i can also defeat the law enforcement field since i could make my own with a different k then the one i be use knowing f also allow traffic analysi to be perform so i might not know what you be say but i could know who you be say it too now i admit that someone try to compute u will not have lot of message to work from but since we have no way of know that the key generation method do not deliberately generate weak key or for that matter that the publish method be in fact use perhap the u will be choose from know weak key for the system obviously the compromise of f would be a disaster both to law enforcement for whom thi whole thing be design and for the person who believe that it be give them security f be but one number and i sure that alot of person more then know what it be and if some panel of expert be go to check it over for flaw then many more will know f forget grind chip bribery and blackmail work just fine so be i wrong or be these problem jon
