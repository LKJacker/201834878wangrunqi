from smb steven bellovin subject re clipper consider harmful in article john kelsey write the clipper chip user key be form by e d e e d e e d e why be the triple-encrytion use is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch if so why use bite key not know anything about the skipjack algorithm it not really possible to gues whether thi make it harder or easier to gues why be and form a they be it would be facinating to see the skipjack algorithm to look for way of attack it that require three ciphertext block form in that odd way where do the constant value that be concatenate with the serial number to form come from are they change from chip to chip or session to session even if they publish in the ny time if skipjack be resistant to known-plaintext attack when use triple encryption then there no break in security but why allow that kind of weird format if those three value be truly-random bite then maybe it use to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on skipjack if it exist ca be easily use to derive and for a whole production run of these chip i ca answer all my question in detail but i can take a stab at them the form the operation that compute and be of course the famou triple encryption suggest for use with de it much stronger than a single encryption and ha an effective key length of bite for reason that be discuss when de wa first standardize a simple double encryption would not have the same strength triple encryption ha be use by ibm since more or le the begin to encrypt other key it recommend for anything of very high value and i think we can agree that the and fit that description why and well you need different plaintext value i have no idea if they be disclose or not at a gues they construct so that they differ in a many bite position a possible a goo cryptosystem will scramble thing a lot with even a change but the value of n in a series will have fairly similar bite pattern and there might conceivably be a weaknes so the value be and i guess choose to increase the hamming distance in any event i quite convince that one can not go back to the from the let alone u observe if the nsa ha u they do need to find but even if they do they ca get and in theory they should never even see those value even with a warrant the real question i think be why use thi scheme at all a oppose to a hardware random number generator my answer be that thi be much more verifiable look suppose that nsa nist the aclu the eff and the nra combine to build a really good random number generator and that it pass every test you could think of when you come back next week to program some more chip do it still work that well have any component change in value have the component be change out from under you do it still work well the in the presence of a focus microwave beam that tend to bia it toward select bite ye you can run detail statistical test on it again but that hard consider on the other hand a software solution you bring ymy own floppy with you you can run cryptographic checksum etc it a lot easier to verify that the software be unchanged in other word ye i can think of way to cheat software too i think that they a lot harder there be three issue with clipper the first be whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme be capable of work my answer with one significant exception be ye i really do think that nsa and nist have design thi scheme about a well a can be assume that their real objective be a state to permit wiretapping under certain carefully-controlled circumstance with a minimum risk of abuse the exception be that u exist outside of the chip on a program diskette that seriously wrong and should be load onto the chip separately to those who disagree and i do claim my answer be obviou though i find my own reason sufficiently persuasive that i wa force to rewrite the conclusion section of my technical analysi paper i have originally blast the scheme i issue thi invitation assume that you be charge with implement such a system with complete regard for civil right and due proces what would you do differently in answer thi question please accept nsa fundamental assumption that both strong cryptography against outsider and the ability to wiretap some domestic user be necessary if you feel it necessary to challenge those assumption do it in the context of the last issue i present below right here i discuss just the technical aspect and no i do by any mean claim that just because something can be do it should be the second issue be whether or not thi whole architecture be actually go to be use just because clipper chip be make thi way do mean that that the only way they be make maybe the nsa will substitute it own chip between the program facility and the ship dock and they generate bogu warrant request so that the escrow agent do wonder why they never call sorry guy all them terrorist and drug dealer and pedophile seem to have buy triple-de phone instead who thunk it i have no answer to thi question and at the moment i do see a way of answer it those concern be part of my reason in my answer to the final question below the third and most seriou issue be whether or not clipper be a good idea even if carry out strictly accord to the letter of the law i think that the answer be no but it not a no-brainer i a civil libertarian not a libertarian for reason that i explain at great length on the net in the elder day and that i do have the energy to repeat now but that mean that i will to accept that some law be necessary so long a they respect the essential right of individual the government already ha the ability and in my system the right to issue search warrant and while that power ha certainly be abuse it also be use quite properly and fairly in other case is key escrow sufficiently different i think so but again it not an easy question for me it be easy for libertarian to answer of course since clipper be completely alien to much of the rest of their oft-admirable philosophy and it also easy for those who give their unreserved trust to government a group i much more distant from steve bellovin
