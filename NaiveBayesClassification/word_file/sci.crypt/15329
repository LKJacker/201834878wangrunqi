from pat pat myrto subject re once tap ymy code be no good any more in article brad brad templeton write in article tcmay timothy c may write getting the court order to reveal the key also make decipherable all past conversation which may be on tape or disk or whatver a i understand the proposal i could be wrong but i see no mention of session key be the escrowed entity true in theory in practice the technology of cellular phone will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key if the frequency path depend on they key a i understand it to it could be make effectively impossible to record i be not an expert in the cryptography science but some basic thing seem evident to me thing which thi clinton clipper do not addres the all pertain to opportunite for abuse and conclusion base on what i have see the membership of thi group except for two notable person agree to if anything bad be possible by the government in theory it almost alway end up happen in fact so the key be to make abuse impossible question authority and remember power do corrupt i think one ha to regard thi whole idea in the sense that it will be expand to include other datum form such a datum transfer and store datum and a such should be treat a if it be expand or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop use clipper a a precident there wa a hint of that in the proposal remember that say please bear with me i be not very articulate so i take more word to say what other could say much more briefly thank you once it hit land you can record it if you have telco acces the telco be suppose to give that without a warrant that the rule today a i suggest thi be now the hint be in the proposal that thi or similar proposal be be consider for other form of encryption such a datum transfer datum file and such largely dependent on how thi thing be accept or fly i think one would be wise to treat thi in the manner one would when not if it get expand to other area than cellular phone i think thi be guarantee to happen if thi proposal get by salami politic it ha be and be use in several other area it be certain to be use here government be not go to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to order require ha prove to be a rather flimsy guarantee if the case warrant they can alway sieze the material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on periodically renew contempt charge so it be not deny the justice system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty or refuse to divulge the mean to acces the info thi be not protect under the fifth one can be force to perform act that would result in divulge incriminate evidence so block restriction on private encryption be not prevent legitimate law enforcement it do make illegitimate law enforcement a bunch more difficult especially fish expedition without the target knowlege do give up the right to be safe from that that should be non-negotiable and clinton and co know it which be probably why they quietly develop thi thing figure if they get it thi far they can ram it on through how come those consult could be roughly describe a u insider they can not quietely impliment it though when they ban other scheme to ensure it exclusive use hence the nice pr document to try and reassure everyone do buy into it ha government really earn that kind of trust past or future to be secure and free one must keep government honest and the only way to do that be to make abuse impossible not or but even so the evidence would not be admissible i think unles the judge so order i think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal cop ca record today plain cellular call and then ask a judge hey can we have permission to listen to those tape can they so what one could use information gain by re-use of the key save after the last case wa finish or other mean master key backdoor easily break algorithm to find other evidence which give to a judge would authorize a tap which would have be possible otherwise thi ha be the more common manner of abuse of wiretap in the past for local cop thi might be workable to keep them honest but the fed have a workaround somehow bet on it do anyone really believe for example that the government will use a scheme nsa can not listen in on scan for keyword either easily defeat in realtime or vium a key i sure do thi whole thing sound like something to eliminate the need to use old-fashioned polouse work to build a case in the past eavesdrop wa rather easy with or without a court order i think the law enforcement community ha become a bite spoil and will resist change that require them to revert to use old-fashioned detective work i just find it somewhat surprise come from a bunch that care so much about civil and individual right that put person first the question be put person first to where with the innard not be reveal how be one to be sure there do exist a key for use by nsa etc so they can do their keyword scan etc on conversation they routinely monitor without a specific court order remember the cellular phone limitiation be only temporary bet on it and so far i have not hear about polouse tell person that they have be tap and nothing incriminate wa find what be to keep them from simply keep the key on file for time after awhile they would have quite a collection kept especially for folk they deem and if they get only one key that would reduce the search space a lot unles it be an rsa scheme remember nixon year need for court order really slow them down do it and unles the escrow account be not government control fat chance i see one end up be under say treasury the other under justice it could be worth some seriou buck to some folk to get key to a competitor clinton clipper or descendent when thi idea be expand to be use for all non-government encryption enough buck would get one the key or the innard for thi algorithm perhap not an important concern but give past government behavior and the other problem worse of course if the government then use thi clinton clipper to argue for restriction on unapproved encryption thi be the main concern of most of u i think the camel nose in the tent etc ye that be a major concern but i think that they think they can win just by have of the usa use thi system they do even have to care about the cautiou that leave they do catch the really smart crook anyway john gottus who would have to be retard not to realize he wa likely to be wiretapped glibly chat away on hi tap phone about murder plan that why he in jail now hard to believe but true what will one do when it be expand to datum storage encryption you can bet that if clipper be accept that will be next on the agenda it be even hint at in the proposal read it carefully expect the argumet well if you get nothing to hide fine then use that argument one should not object to video camera be instal in every room of one home granted an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle hold private stuff should remain private even from a govt fish expedition and may change in the future a to when it come to the fed government safeguard be pretty meaningles if they want to something do work so hard to give up some rather treasure right or establish bad precident please the price could be hell to pay later thi scheme can succeed without law forbid more which person would fight a lot harder they like thi enough that they be drop the so call digital telephony proposal accord to rumour however the mean of that be complex since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco system and that require a bite of work person would fight law forbid more now but in say two year because we have thi situation which must be address by some action just thi add reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide etc please do buy into it if the clinton clipper be so very good why not make it algrithm public so many person can exchange idea and examine it rather than a few isolate expert respect by whom for what perhap a certain professor who like key bank would be one of the select expert thi do seem to expand on some idea the person wa advocate if i recall how would anybody know that what the expert examine be the same a what will end up be use in the clipper chip if it be keep secret perhap the clipper will use a cripple version with a key provision or feature not present in the version subject for study and evaluation by the expert and who choose the experte the government no conflict of interest there and be it a requirement for any decent encryption scheme that it not have it effectivenes reduce by have the algrorithm widely know i wa lead to believe that one should assume the other side ha everything you have except for the key s i recall idea present to thi group be reject if a requirement exist the algorithm be secret another question since it be a safe bet thi clipper thing would not be use for government security they be regard it a not real secure but good enough for common folk i think i would like to see a full description not a pr non-statement of just what good enough mean i think when say how strong it be good enough really mean not very the excuse that other country have these restriction be not acceptable other country do not have my bill of right and constitution which the person not the government of those other country often regard with envy what we have a right they have a revokable privilege and if we expect to retain those right and protection we must not allow them to be gutted because we just got tum have thi thing to crime we have allready have my bill of right pretty much tear to shred we should not permit more weakining for yet another cause instead we should be try to repair the damage my crime problem may have a number of cause but too many right and safeguard be not a signifigant one a break court system and poor polouse work be a much more signifigant cause a have too many right disregard address the root cause for crime etc btw those who suggest that thi be just an attack on clinton believe thi i would be go ballistic reagardles who seriously propose thi thing it be just another step in a gradual erosion of my right under the constitution or bill of right the last couple of decade have be a non-stop series of end-run around the protection of the constitution it ha to stop now be a good a time a any if it be too late allready brad templeton
