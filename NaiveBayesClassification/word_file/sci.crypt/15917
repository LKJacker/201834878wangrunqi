from ijame carl ijame subject re revised technical summary of clipper chip in article denning write each chip include the follow component the skipjack encryption algorithm f an family key that be common to all chip n a serial number thi length be subject to change u an secret key that unlock all message encrypt with the chip to see how the chip be use imagine that it be embed in the at t telephone security device a it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after push a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an session key k with the device at the other end thi key negotiation take place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be use such a the diffie-hellman public-key distribution method once the session key k be establish the clipper chip be use to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitize voice the telephone security device fee k and m into the chip to produce two value e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which be transmit over the telephone line the law enforcement field thu contain the session key k encrypt under the unit key u concatenate with the serial number n all encrypt under the family key f the law enforcement field be decrypt by law enforcement after an authorize wiretap ha be instal is the u use in the law enforcement field from the phone which place the call from the unit whose secure session button wa press first or do each phone transmit it own law enforcement field even assume one of the first two choice the fbi be go to get a fresh n u for it own database about every other phone call eventually accumulate key for all the phone use to connect to the line they be monitor not just the key assuming the ever-thrifty fbi do forget each key after it wiretap permission ha expire not quite a pyramid but not bad either carl ijame ijame more worry every day
