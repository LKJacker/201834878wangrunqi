from denning subject the clipper chip a technical summary the follow document summarize the clipper chip how it be use how program of the chip be couple to key generation and the escrow proces and how law enforcement decrypt communication since there ha be some speculation on thi news group about my own involvement in thi project i like to add that i wa not in any way involve i find out about it when the fbi brief me on thursday even april since then i have spend considerable time talk with the nsa and fbi to learn more about thi and i attend the nist brief at the department of commerce on april the document below be the result of that effort dorothy denning the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning april introduction on april the president announce a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communication while meet the legitimate need of law enforcement at the heart of the plan be a new tamper-proof encryption chip call the clipper chip together with a split-key approach to escrowing key two escrow agency be use and the key part from both be need to reconstruct a key chip structure the clipper chip contain a classify block encryption algorithm call skipjack the algorithm use bite key compare with for the de and ha round of scramble compare with for the de it support all de mode of operation throughput be mbit a second each chip include the follow component the skipjack encryption algorithm f an family key that be common to all chip n a serial number u an secret key that unlock all message encrypt with the chip encrypting with the chip to see how the chip be use imagine that it be embed in the at t telephone security device a it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after push a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate a session key k with the device at the other end in general any method of key exchange can be use the key k and message stream m digitize voice be then feed into the clipper chip to produce two value e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block the law enforcement block thu contain the session key k encrypt under the unit key u concatenate with the serial number n all encrypt under the family key f chip programming and escrow all clipper chip be program inside a scif secure computer information facility which be essentially a vault the scif contain a laptop computer and equipment to program the chip about chip be program during a single session the scif be locate at mikotronx at the begin of a session a trust agent from each of the two key escrow agency enter the vault agent enter an value into the laptop and agent enter an value these value serve a seed to generate key for a sequence of serial number to generate the unit key for a serial number n the value n be first pad with a fix block to produce a block and be then use a key to triple-encrypt produce a block e d e similarly n be pad with two other block to produce and and two additional block and be compute e d e e d e and be then concatenate together give bite the first bite be assign to and the second bite to the rest be discard the unit key u be the xor of and and be the key part that be separately escrowed with the two escrow agency a a sequence of value for and u be generate they be write onto three separate floppy disk the first disk contain a file for each serial number that contain the correspond key part the second disk be similar but contain the value the third disk contain the unit key u agent take the first disk and agent take the second disk the third disk be use to program the chip after the chip be program all information be discard from the vault and the agent leave the laptop may be destroy for additional assurance that no information be leave behind the protocol may be change slightly so that fmy person be in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seed and and the second two the escrow agent would take the disk back to the escrow agency the escrow agency have a yet to be determine but they will not be the nsa cium fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement ha be authorize to tap an encrypt line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get acces to the communication line let u assume that the tap be in place and that they have determine that the line be encrypt with clipper they will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key f thi gife them e k u n they will then take a warrant identify the chip serial number n to each of the key escrow agent and get back and and be xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u be decrypt to get the session key k finally the message stream be decrypt all thi will be accomplish through a special black box decoder operate by the fbi acknowledgment and distribution notice all information be base on information provide by nsa nist and the fbi permission to distribute thi document be grant
