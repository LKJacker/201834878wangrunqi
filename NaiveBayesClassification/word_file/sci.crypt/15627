from grady subject re the secret source of that announcement i gues the cryptowrangler read thi group too but of course i know that because it be so easy to do there be not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that pas every significant gateway or be capture for the colligation of datum about maybe ymy name be here maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypt post intend of member of affinity group with a share private key for example at the come up cypherpunk meet a private key correspond to that particular meet could be pass out by a moderator minute followup comment to other participant and so on could be post to the group for the use of the person who attend communique intend by the group for non-attendee could of course just be sign use the private key but otherwise not encrypt starting a newsgroup rather than just maintain mail list be better for several reason first it would be easier to archive for person who might join a group late and who might like to easily read earlier post second traffic analysi to know exactly to whom an affinity message be direct would be foil three a newsgroup be much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measure on the internet and it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such key it beat give out t-shirt a a door prize we could send a copy of directly to judge william session or admiral studeman to save them the time of have it collect for them grady ad fc ac
