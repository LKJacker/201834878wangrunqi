from patl patrick j loprestus subject re in article steve-b steve brinich write second question why why be such a strange procedure use and not a real rng thi turn those in a kind of bottleneck for system security the only theory that make any sense be that and be either the same for all chip or vary among very few possibility so that anyone try to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the possible serial number about one billion multiply by the number of different combination suppose instead that and can be reconstruct give or of the unit key generate in a single batch through some sort of know plaintext attack say suppose further that or of the chip program in each session never find their way into commercial product but instead end up elsewhere suppose the folk at elsewhere can determine a unit key give physical acces to one of these chip then those same folk can determine and for the whole batch too many supposition yeah probably pat
