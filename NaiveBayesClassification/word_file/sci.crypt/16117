from amanda amanda walker subject re my letter about clipper david reeve sward sward write we do know thi do we the algorithm be classify i speculate from the mykotronx datum sheet on the that the algorithm be a classify cryptosystem similar in application to de but clear by the nsa for classify traffic that ha be in use for a number of year myktotronx refer to it a government type ius encryption which match the designation of one of the type of encryption available on stu-iius phone and may be the same a a cryptosystem i have hear call thi would make sense since thi be evidently a field-proven cryptosystem which can act a a pin-compatible substitute for de combined with a tappable key exchange protocol thi would offer exactly what be claim for clipper secure encryption with acces vium a key escrow if thi be fact the case it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself now i do not know if these be in fact the same cryptosystem my knowledge of classify cryptography be even fuzzy it nonexistent however it would certainly have be the least-effort approach on the part of the government take an old military cipher that person can drop in place of de and which be at least a secure set up a key escrow scheme for law enforcement and promote it for public use thi also fit with mykotronx who be around but almost invisible for year ha anyone else make thi sort of connection or be i just hallucinate pink elephant here my curiousity ha be pique amanda walker intercon system corporation
