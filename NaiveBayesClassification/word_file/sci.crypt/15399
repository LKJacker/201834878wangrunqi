from bontchev vesselin bontchev subject re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key-escrow strnlght david sternlight write though some may argue about the nose of the camel it worth note that the government proposal be limit to scramble telephony if it be only use for that purpose and do not extend to electronic mail or file a usual david sternlight be demonstrate hi inability to read the proposal clearly state the initiative will involve the creation of new product to accelerate the development and use of advance and secure telecommunication network and wireles communication link it speak about telecommunication in general read it again david maybe you understand it the next time nah probably not encryption then it is an improvement over the current mass-produce standard civilian technology which with a few exception be limit to easy-to-break inverter that exactly what the government want all sheep-minded person to think let look at the current situation it allow to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody unles secure and i mean secure encryption be use what will happen when if ha optimist the new proposal get accept almost nobody except some will be able to eavesdrop everybody else but the ability of these some to eavesdrop will be guarantee the proposal emphasize on the former almost nobody which be clearly an improvement and forget to mention the drawback of the latter guarantee ye my statement assume that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful you think that it will not happen good luck note that the big issue for the feed be the continue ability to wiretap it not just continue ability it guarantee ability before we go off the deep end with long discusion about secure crypto for e-mail and file let focu on thi yeah that exactly what ymy government want you to think let take small step one at a time concentrate on the current one do think about the future trust u one question that wa not ask in the release be whether thi proposal be limit to telephony or if the government intend to expand it it not ask because the proposal clearly say that thi be the intention they unlike you read what they write though i share many of the concern express by some i find the proposal le threaten than many other since right now most american have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip lead and a goat can eavesdrop thi would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordles phone ye it will it will stop the jerk who be eavesdrop now it will allow only to the government to eavesdrop if the scheme be secure of course which be yet to be prove but how do you know that the jerk you be fear now will not get a government job tomorrow the new proposal guarantee him the ability to eavesdrop then hell that will even motivate him to get that job if he indeed be that mentally pervert reading between the line i infer that the system be highly secure without acces to the key great the greatest cryptographer of all time david sternlight tm ha succeed to evaluate the new system in the absense of any detail whatsoever and ha conclude that it be highly secure i gues that come from the background of work some year for the two major crypto evaluate company right gee now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto expert to secretly analyse the new secret method for david sternlight ha already do all the job for them thi would meet the need of business confront by rich and powerful adversary include french and japanese security service and rich japanese company it allow the nsa to make available some of it better stuff while protect law enforcement need trust u we from the government and we here to help you most legitimate corporation trust the nsa and would be delight to have a high-security system certify by them even at the price of deposit key in escrow i see no difficulty in create a reliable those who be prepare to trade their liberty for the promise of future safety do not deserve either thi or something like that i do have the exact quote but the mean be the same ha be say by one of ymy great man maybe you should study their work more carefully if you have the brain to understand them of course from my point of view thi be a fair start point there be concern that need to be address include the reliability of the escrow but in the main question be to guarantee to availability of really secure cryptography to the mass gee if the proposal wa say we guarantee that every american will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption would like and regard thi proposal a just a default voluntary implementation there would have be much le opposition for some reason they do even try to promise you that i wonder why wa orwell off only by year return we get acces to high-security crypto no in return you get crypto that be guarantee to be cripple many have suggest that de and other system may be breakable by the nsa and hence other similarly skilled and endow while the above be just rumor and while even if it be true it be not do easily the new scheme can be guarantee to be easily breakable by anybody who ha the two key it might be also breakable by somebody who do not have them but know the right trick or who ha only one of them nsa also tell you that de be secure why do you simply trust them huh there be at least a good possibility which should be check that the propose system be not so breakable it do have to it be guarantee to be easily breakable just get the key it might be even easier but until there be some evidence thi be just a wild speculation be nor do it have to have trapdoor if the government can get the key the trapdoor be there in government hand the key pursuant to a legitimate court order thu they can protect legitimate communication against economic adversary while still be able to eavesdrop on crook pursuant to a court order legitimate and who decide what communication be legitimate oh i gues it the government right the guy who already have the key it kinda if i have the key from ymy car and i be ask to decide who ha the right to use it legitimately in discuss thi let try to avoid the nastines personal attack and noise of some previou thread impossible since you be demonstrate the same level of incompetence and ignorance a in the proviou thread thi be a substantive and technical issue and personal remark have no place in such a discussion unfortunately i have yet to see you post a technically competent message regard vesselin
