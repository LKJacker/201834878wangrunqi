from tarnold todd w arnold subject re how sensible be de toward bit-error in cat axel dunkel write how sensible be de encrypt datum toward bite error how much datum per bite will be lose in average i assume you still have the correct key it depend on the mode you use for a single input block a one-bit error will have a percent chance of corrupt each of the output bite in other word it essentially turn the output block into a random number if you encrypt datum in cbc mode however only the one block will be affect the next block and all that follow it will be decrypt properly it a good idea to have some kind of error correction in ymy system if corrupt bite be likely todd
