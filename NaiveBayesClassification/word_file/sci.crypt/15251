from crypt-comment subject cryptography faq net etiquette archive-name last-modified faq for part net etiquette thi be the second of ten part of the faq the part be mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest we do have the time to send out miss part by mail so do ask note such a refer to the reference list in the last part the section of thi faq be available vium anonymou ftp to a xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroup and every day content what group be around what a faq who be i why be i here do political discussion belong in how do i present a new encryption scheme in what group be around what a faq who be i why be i here read and for a few week alway make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it you be amaze how often the same question can be ask in the same newsgroup after a month you have a much better sense of what the reader want to see do political discussion belong in no in fact some newsgroup notably be create exactly so that political question like should rsa be patent do get in the way of technical discussion many reader also read et al for the benefit of person who do care about those other topic try to put ymy post in the right group question about microfilm and smuggle and other non-cryptographic spy stuff do belong in either how do i present a new encryption scheme in i just come up with thi neat method of encryption here some ciphertext fhdsijoyw ogbujhkfsyuire is it strong without a doubt question like thi be the most annoy traffic on if you have come up with an encryption scheme provide some ciphertext from it be not adequate nobody ha ever be impress by random gibberish any new algorithm should be secure even if the opponent know the full algorithm include how any message key be distribute and only the private key be keep secret there be some systematic and unsystematic way to take reasonably long ciphertext and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm but thi be a time-consuming and possibly fruitles exercise which most reader wo bother with so what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme first of all find out if it really new look through thi faq for reference and relate method familiarize yourself with the literature and the introductory textbook when you can appreciate how ymy cryptosystem fit into the world at large try to break it yourself you should waste the time of ten of thousand of reader ask a question which you could have easily answer on ymy own if you really think ymy system be secure and you want to get some reassurance from expert you might try post full detail of ymy system include work code and a solid theoretical explanation to keep in mind that the export of cryptography be regulate in some area if you lucky an expert might take some interest in what you post you can encourage thi by offer cash reward for instance note cryptographer ralph merkle be offer to anyone who can break but there be no guarantee if you do have enough experience then most likely any expert who look at ymy system will be able to find a flaw if thi happen it ymy responsibility to consider the flaw and learn from it rather than just add one more layer of complication and come back for another round a different way to get ymy cryptosystem review be to have the nsa look at it a full discussion of thi procedure be outside the scope of thi faq among professional a common rule of thumb be that if you want to design a cryptosystem you have to have experience a a cryptanalyst
