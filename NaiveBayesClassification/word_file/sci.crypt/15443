from pat pat myrto subject re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key-escrow in article strnlght david sternlight write in article holland dougla craig holland write let me ask you thi would you trust richard nixon with ymy crypto key i would i take it you mean president nixon not private citizen nixon sure nothing i do would be of the slightest interest to president nixon i be sure you do mi the implication that we could have another richard nixon type president in the future perhap not too distant future acutally with that in mind then i take it you also would not object to the gov come up with a decision not proposal just like clinton cripple be a decision not a proposal spring on u to start place video camera with sound in every room of ymy house which could be activate without ymy knowlege they would be well conceal so you would know the location to prevent you from cover the len open after all nothing you do would be of the slightest interest to a government official right so you surely should not object to such a proposal not the best anology but the principle be pretty close the ability to eavesdrop on ymy activity with little or no effort without ymy knowlege protect by entirely by government safeguard you can still draw ymy curtain so you can still have ymy privacy from everyone else except big brother after all we need thi for protection from drug dealer and terrorist and other criminal like of the state and you do really have a right to unbreakable privacy anyway sort of a the pres release of the clinton cripple decision put it i find it curiou they use the word unbreakable when the term really should be difficult to break without proper authorization which the government most certainly ha at their disposal right they would want to be able to break it illegally would they nawww not for the person clinton can you while my mind be on it give u one good reason that the algorithm should be a secret algorithm unles thi encryption scheme either be a joke or contain feature like a key or other back door for unauthorized eavesdrop if it wa really even moderately secure and the government really mean to require the proper court order and the key that be in the escrow account to be able to decipher the traffic what be the need to keep the algorithm secret seem i hear rather often that if an encryption scheme require the algorithm to remain a secret to be effective it be not a worthwhile scheme be thi just idle talk or be the administration bullshit everyone with great skepticism and many doubt on my administration intention and wait we have be tell the next gem the administration ha in mind for e-mail and datafile security the pres release do say that thi be part of a comprehensive thing on datum security for u unprivileged citizen perhap would be the better term somehow do not seem appropriate that imply a free person better fit a population who serve at the pleasure of their ruler one thing for certain the government no longer regard the citizen a their bos anymore but the other way around pat without prejudice ucc pat myrto seattle wa if all else fail try uunet pilchuck rwing pat wisdom only two thing be infinite the universe and human stupidity and i be not sure about the former albert einstien
