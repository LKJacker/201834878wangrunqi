from crypt-comment subject cryptography faq public key cryptography archive-name last-modified faq for part public-key cryptography thi be the sixth of ten part of the faq the part be mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest we do have the time to send out miss part by mail so do ask note such a refer to the reference list in the last part the section of thi faq be available vium anonymou ftp to a xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroup and every day content what be public-key cryptography what rsa is rsa secure how fast can person factor number what about other public-key cryptosystem what be public-key cryptography in a classic cryptosystem we have encryption function and decryption function such that p p for any plaintext p in a public-key cryptosystem can be easily compute from some public key x which in turn be compute from k x be publish so that anyone can encrypt message if can not be easily compute from x then only the person who generate k can decrypt message that the essence of public-key cryptography publish by diffie and hellman in in a classic cryptosystem if you want ymy friend to be able to send secret message to you you have to make sure nobody other than them see the key k in a public-key cryptosystem you just publish x and you do have to worry about spy thi be only the begin of public-key cryptography there be an extensive literature on security model for public-key cryptography application of public-key cryptography other application of the mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography and so on what rsa rsa be a public-key cryptosystem define by rivest shamir and adleman for full detail there be a faq available by ftp at here a small example plaintext be positive integer up to key be quadruple p q e d with p a prime number q a prime number and d and e large number with de divisible by we define p mod pq c mod pq now be easily compute from the pair pq e but a far a anyone know there be no easy way to compute from the pair pq e so whoever generate k can publish pq e anyone can send a secret message to him he be the only one who can read the message is rsa secure nobody know an obviou attack on rsa be to factor pq into p and q see below for comment on how fast state-of-the-art factorization algorithm run unfortunately nobody ha the slightest idea how to prove that factorization or any realistic problem at all for that matter be inherently slow it be easy to formalize what we mean by rsa strong but a hendrik w lenstra jr say exact definition appear to be necessary only when one wish to prove that algorithm with certain property do not exist and theoretical computer science be notoriously lack in such negative result how fast can person factor number it depend on the size of the number in october arjen lenstra and dan bernstein factor into prime use about three week of maspar time the maspar be a simd machine each processor can add about integer per second the algorithm there be call the number field sieve it be quite a bite faster for special number like than for general number n but it take time only about exp o log n log log n in any case an older and more popular method for smaller number be the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve which take time exp o log n log log n faster than the number field sieve for small n but slower for large n the breakeven point be somewhere between and digit depend on the implementation factorization be a fast-moving field the state of the art just a few year ago wa nowhere near a good a it be now if no new method be develop then rsa key will alway be safe from factorization but one ca predict the future before the number field sieve wa find many person conjecture that the quadratic sieve wa asymptotically a fast a any factor method could be what about other public-key cryptosystem we talk about rsa because it well know and easy to describe but there be lot of other public-key system around many of which be faster than rsa or depend on problem more widely believe to be difficult thi ha be just a brief introduction if you really want to learn about the many facet of public-key cryptography consult the book and journal article list in part
