from grady subject re subliminal channel in ds may i suggest that any any propose cipher system have le entropy than the user key and message can have an embed subliminal channel a big a the difference in entropy between the entropy of the user input message and the entropy of the output for example take plain de the unsuspecting user input a string plaintext to be encipher he crank the algorithm which ha be hack by george quisling and come out with nine char in and nine char out right the unsepecting user ship the ciphertext to be decrpyted and the message plaintext be produce everything fine right nope imagine the algorithm do a lz compression on plaintext before desing compressing be down to fmy character with more entropy wj the opponent now pad the message with hi own message also compress before apply de to the concatenate compress pair when decrpyted the first compress message be strip off and declare send unbeknowst to the receiver the opponent accomplouse collect the remain message in the bite bucket and uncompress to kill now and to prevent all such subliminal or covert storage channel you would need to have maximal entropy all the time which be a priorus impossible because for example a stereotypical message might be replace by one bite in the output reserve the rest of the output bite for the long covert message in other word if you opponent get to muck with the algorithm you either have get to muck with it last or concede hi possible embed of covert channel in other word if you present a message to an opponet with le than maximal entropy then you have give him free bite of storage grady ad fc ac
