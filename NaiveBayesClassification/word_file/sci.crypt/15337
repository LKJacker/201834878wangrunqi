from smb steven bellovin subject clipper chip technical detail i receive the follow two note from martin hellman with detail on how clipper will work they be post with hi permission the implication of some detail be fascinate date sat apr pdt from martin hellman hellman to a long list of recipient subject clipper chip most of you have see the announcement in friday ny time etc about nist national institute of standard technology announce the clipper chip crypto device several messge on the net have ask for more technical detail and some have be labor under understandable misunderstand give the lack of detail in the news article so here to help out be ymy friendly nsa link me i wa somewhat surprise friday to get a call from the agency which supply many of the miss detail i wa tell the info wa public so here it be the cc of thi to denni branstad at nist be mostly a a double check on my fact since i assume he be aware of all thi please let me know if i have anything wrong the clipper chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embed in silicon each chip will have two secret key one will be the same for all chip ie a system-wide key and the other will be unit specific i do know what nist and nsa will call them but i will call them the system key sk and unit key uk in thi message the ic will be design to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be keep secret aside it be clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion it may be a much for that a thi state purpose the unit key will be generate a the xor of two random number and which will be keep by the two escrow authority who these escrow authority will be be still to be decide by the attorney general but it wa stress to me that they will not be nsa or law enforcement agency that they must be party acceptable to the user of the system a unbiased when a law enforcement agency get a court order they will present it to these two escrow authority and receive and thereby allow acces to the unit key uk in addition to the system key each user will get to choose hi or her own key and change it a often a desire call thi key plain old k when a message be to be send it will first be encrypt under k then k will be encrypt under the unit key uk and the serial number of the unit add to produce a three part message which will then be encrypt under the system key sk produce e e m k e k uk serial number sk when a court order obtain and and thence k the law enforcement agency will use sk to decrypt all information flow on the suspect link aside it be my gues that they may do thi constantly on all link with or without a court order since it be almost impossible to tell which link over which a message will flow thi gife the agency acces to e m k e k uk serial number in the above message they then check the serial number of the unit and see if it be on the watch list for which they have a court order if so they will decrypt e k uk to obtain k and then decrypt e m k to obtain m i be still in the proces of assess thi scheme so please do not take the above a any kind of endorsement of the propose scheme all i be try to do be help all of u ass the scheme more knowledgably but i will say that the need for just one court order worry me i would feel more comfortable though not necessarily comfortable if two separate court order be need one per escrow authority while no explanation be need the follow story add some color in research some idea that silvio micali and i have be kick around i speak with gerald gunther the constitutional law expert here at stanford and he relate the follow story when edward levus become pre ford attorney general right after watergate he wa visit by an fbi agent ask for the wiretap authorization when levy ask for the detail so he could review the case a require by law the agent tell him that hi predecessor just turn over blank sign form every time levus do not comply and change the system but the lesson be clear no single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretap or worse yet divulge of personal key sometime he or she will be an edward levus and sometime a john mitchell martin hellman date sun apr pdt from martin hellman hellman to smb subject re clipper chip it be fine to post my previou message to if you also post thi message with it in which i ask recipient to be sparse in their request further info from me or ask for comment on specific question by thi post i apologize for any message i be unable to respond to i already spend too much time answer too much e-mail and be particularly overload thi week with other responsibility i note a probably correction send to me by dorothy denning she meet with the person from nsa that i talk with by phone so her understand be likely to better than mine on thi point where i say the transmit info be e e m k e k uk serial number sk she say the message be not double encrypt the system key or family key a she wa tell it be call only encrypt the serial number or the serial number and the encrypt unit key thi be not a major difference but i think it should be mention and thank her for bring it to my attention it make more sense since it cut down on encryption computation overhead
