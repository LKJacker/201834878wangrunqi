from matt matthew lyle subject re clipper chip reverse engineering maa mark a allyn write you all mention that the algorithm be classify and have express concern and idea of how to figure out the algorithm use software the question that i have be why cant someone take one of these chip and reverse engineer it i mean take the thing to a chip test analysi facility one with a decent electron microscope just pry off the top of the chip and start scan it with the electron microcope and figure out the circuitry i remember a place that i use to work for have one of these facility that they use to analyze chip that we accidently blow out while run test they could actually find the area that wa fry and show u where in the circuit it wa i be sure that many company and university must have these facility and that the potential be there especially at a university where the security at such a facility be looser for someone to take a clipper apart and analyze it what can the government do to prevent thi start take away all microchip analysi facility and electron microscope they be use some technology develop by vlsi system the other manufacturer of the clipper chip that produce chip that be suppose to be highly resistant to reverse engineer matthew lyle matt matt openconnect system dalla texa
