from srt stephen r tate subject re why the clipper algorithm be secret in article johnl john r levine write it just occur to me why the algorithm be secret if it be publish one could then build physically identical clone version of the chip that would interoperate with official clipper chip but the cloner would provide the key to the escrow house hmmn not necessarily they could release the detail of the algorithm without release the system key call sk by hellman that would make most person happy and with some sort of verification procedure before key exchange the official chip would only work with other official chip in other word secrecy of sk make physically identical clone version impossible secrecy of the algorithm should be necessary of course reveal the algorithm open them up to attack on sk since all unit share thi key compromise it may be a big deal personally i would feel too comfortable know that one secret number hold in many place wa all that guarantee my security of course compromise of sk do necessarily mean that the system be compromise but it impossible to tell whether or not that true with a secret algorithm incidentally what to keep a secret algorithm from use the secret sk a the main key with uk be only marginally important then a court order for uk may not even be necessary to do a wiretap steve tate srt the reason why mathematics enjoy special esteem dept of computer science above all other science be that it law be duke university absolutely certain and indisputable while those of all durham nc other science be to some extent debatable einstein
