from danny weitzner djw subject re-inventing crypto policy an eff statement april initial eff analysi of clinton privacy and security proposal the clinton administration today make a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of million of american the first part of the plan be to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communication privacy issue such a export control which have effectively deny most person easy acces to robust encryption and law enforcement issue pose by new technology however eff be very concern that the administration ha already reach a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any public comment or discussion ha be allow apparently the administration be go to use it leverage to get all telephone equipment vendor to adopt a voice encryption standard develop by the national security agency the so-called clipper chip be an split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be build into chip manufacture by a military contractor two separate escrow agent would store user key and be require to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant the encryption scheme use be to be classify but the chip will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into it communication product thi proposal raise a number of seriou concern first the administration ha adopt a solution before conduct an inquiry the nsa-developed clipper chip may not be the most secure product other vendor or developer may have better scheme furthermore we should not rely on the government a the sole source for the clipper or any other chip rather independent chip manufacturer should be able to produce chipset base on open standard second an algorithm can not be trust unles it can be test yet the administration propose to keep the chip algorithm classify eff believe that any standard adopt ought to be public and open the public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that be open to independent expert scrutiny third while the use of the use of a split-key dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement need the detail of thi scheme must be explore publicly before it be adopt what will give person confidence in the safety of their key do disclosure of key to a third party waive an individual fifth amendment right in subsequent criminal inquiry these be but a few of the many question the administration proposal raise but fail to answer in sum the administration ha show great sensitivity to the importance of these issue by plan a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security however the clipper chip solution ought to be consider a part of the inquiry and not be adopt before the discussion even begin detail of the proposal escrow the key will be divide between two escrow agent each of whom hold of each key the manufacturer of the communication device would be require to register all key with the two independent escrow agent a key be tie to the device however not the person use it upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agent would have to turn the key part over to law enforcement agent according to the presidential directive just issue the attorney general will be ask to identify appropriate escrow agent some in the administration have suggest that one non-law enforcement federal agency perhap the federal reserve and one non-governmental organization could be choose but there be no agreement on the identity of the agent yet classified algorithm and the possibility of back door the administration claim that there be no back door mean by which the government or other could break the code without secure key from the escrow agent and that the president will be tell there be no back door to thi classify algorithm in order to prove thi administration source be interest in arrange for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the algorithm for trap door the result of the investigation would then be make public the clipper chipset wa design and be be produce and a sole-source secret contract between the national security agency and two private firm vlsi and mycotronx nsa work on thi plan ha be underway for about fmy year the manufacture contract wa let month ago government a market driver in order to get a market move and to show that the government believe in the security of thi system the feed will be the first big customer for thi product user will include the fbi secret service vp al gore and maybe even the president at today commerce department pres brief a number of person ask thi question though why would any private organization or individual adopt a classify standard that have no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap door comprehensive policy inquiry the administration ha also announce that it be about to commence an inquiry into all policy issue relate to privacy protection encryption and law enforcement the item to be consider include export control on encryption technology and the fbi digital telephony proposal it appear that the thi inquiry will be conduct by the national security council unfortunately however the presidential directive describe the inquiry be classify some public involvement in the proces ha be promise but they term have yet to be specify from more information contact jerry berman executive director jberman daniel j weitzner senior staff counsel djw full text of the pres release and fact sheet issue by the administration will be available on eff ftp site danny weitzner senior staff counsel eff
