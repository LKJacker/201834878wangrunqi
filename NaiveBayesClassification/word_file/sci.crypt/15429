from zrepachol paul repacholi subject re clipper chip long follow up in article jim jim gillogly write thi document be in the anonymou ftp directory at nist look to me like the other shoe ha drop jim gillogly trewesday astron thank for post thi and make it available thi post will be long i will comment on most of it and be reluctantly leave all of the original in place to provide context please note that an alt group ha be set up for the clipper stuff note thi file will also be available vium anonymou file transfer from in directory and vium the nist computer security bb at the white house office of the pres secretary for immediate release april statement by the pres secretary the president today announce a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary hum at t vlsi and mykotronx be wonder what happen to ibm thi should be right up their street and a mandate scheme be voluntary mr orwell would love thi program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communication while meet the legitimate need of law enforcement telephone encryption and scramble be year behind digital one like rsa idea or even de the above while literaly true be a clasic straw-man claim in the context of non-real-time circuit such a e-mail and the like the initiative will involve the creation of new product to accelerate the development and use of advance and secure telecommunication network and wireles communication link i would modestly propose that a mandate use of isdn would do more for commun ication than thi lot for too long there ha be little or no dialogue between my private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenge of protect american rather than use technology to accommodate the sometime compete interest of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previou policy have pit government against industry and the right of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology ha be use for year to protect electronic fund transfer it be now be use to protect electronic mail and computer file while encryption normmaly de technology can help american protect busines secret and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be use by terrorist drug dealer and other criminal note the use of the word busines in the above the whole tenor of thi release seem to be establish a grind rule that only busines use be legitimate for debate if you want the nothing you drop in ymy wife ear to remain secret and private that be not even on the agenda for debate note that there be no role for you to contain private info in thi the only reference be to information already in the hand of other the release bite be also draw a long bow most of these case be by person who have legitimate acces abuse it and reveal or often sell the info these person be of course in thi proposal the person who will have the key the criminal also use lawer court the cium white-house official and pen to go about their busines when will they be outlaw a well yeah several of them would be a better idea than clipper them again the protection of law and the court have be seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so a state-of-the-art microcircuit call the clipper chip ha be develop by government engineer the chip represent a nsa new approach to encryption technology yeah thi bite be very true it can be use in new relatively inexpensive encryption device that can be attach to an ordinary telephone it scramble telephone communication use an encryption algorithm that be more powerful than many in commercial use today note the repeat mix of telephone scrabeling and encryption a demo of the above claim on an ordanary pot would be a good night entertainment i suspect note also the not a the general tone imply thi new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of datum transmit electronically at the same time thi technology preserve the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agency to intercept lawfully the phone conversation of criminal the case record seem to indicate that what be need be a brutal tighten of the current bus i have not hear yet of a case that wa impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the man in black the other side abuse by law enforcer be well document even by govt agency and the phone v other com be blur yet again a key-escrow system will be establish to ensure that the clipper chip be use to protect the privacy of law-abiding american a key-escrow system will be establish to ensure that the clipper chip be use to protect the privacy of law-abiding american let run that line twice not very carefully what it say the state purpose of the key eschrow be to make the use of clipper compulsory note the word ensure a to or i will leave to you so to the person who ask if it include the outlaw of other encryption the answer in thi pres release be ye each device contain the chip will have two unique key number that will be need by authorize government agency to decode message encode by the device when the device be manufacture the two key will be deposit separately in two key-escrow datum basis that will be establish by the attorney general acces to these key will be limit to government official with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap just a they only can wiretap now with a warrent the clipper chip technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to acces the content of the private conversation of american just make sure that the illegal one be preserve to demonstrate the effectivenes of thi new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new device in addition respect expert from outside the government will be offer acces to the confidential detail of the algorithm to ass it capability and publicly report their find where do you find many expert any ex kgb person look for a contract and a a later post ask what of the stu-iii they already have it will be very interest to see if the military and u embasy start to use it after all it be secure be it the govt will answer that point by it own action the chip be an important step in address the problem of encryption dual-edge sword encryption help to protect the privacy of individual and industry but it also can shield criminal and terrorist we need the clipper chip and other approach that can both provide law-abiding citizen with acces to the encryption they need and prevent criminal from use it to hide their illegal activity in order to ass technology trend and explore new approach like the key-escrow system the president ha direct government agency to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodate the privacy of my citizen include the need to employ voice or datum encryption for busines purpose again personal use seem to be a unaskable question the ability of authorize official to acces telephone call and datum under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect my citizen ah so warrent be not alway need it seem the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure need to promote economic growth and the competitivenes of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of company to manufacture and export high technology product the itar seem to slightly impeed thi the president ha direct early and frequent consultation with affect industry the congres and group that advocate the privacy right of individual a policy option be develop the administration be commit to work with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunication and computer technology to give american unprecedented acces to information thi infrastructure of high-speed network information superhighway will transmit video image hdtv program and huge datum file a easily a today telephone system transmit voice note that all thi wonderfull stuff will be in secret only the person will be able to expres an opinion hence only the desire result will emerge since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy regard it use the administration be commit to policy that protect all american right to privacy while also protect them from those who break the law encryption and code have be around for millenium they be generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time the systematic study of cypher ha result in a swing in favor of the encrypter at the moment i have no doubt that the factor problem will fall in time probably fofr practical purpose by the middle of the next century further information be provide in an accompany fact sheet the provision of the president directive to acquire the new encryption technology be also available for additional detail call mat heyman national institute of standard and technology question and answer about the clinton administration telecommunication initiative q do thi approach expand the authority of government agency to listen in on phone conversation a no clipper chip technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to acces the content of the private conversation of american q suppose a law enforcement agency be conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggle ring and intercept a conversation encrypt use the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of thi authorization to the two entity responsible for safeguard the key and obtain the key for the device be use by the drug smuggler the key be split into two part which be store separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow datum bank a the two key-escrow datum bank will be run by two independent entity at thi point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agency will oversee the key-escrow datum bank it be a little hard to critisise a non-proposal q how strong be the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security be a thi system be more secure than many other voice encryption system readily available today note we drop back to again if thi be a true answer it can be rephrase a it suck big time anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast while the algorithm will remain classify to protect the security of the key escrow system thi link between the security of the key-eschrow and the actual algorithm be a real winner given that i have secret bite number could someone please explain how the detail of an encryption algorithm will reveal them we be will to invite an independent panel of cryptography expert to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential user that there be no unrecognized vulnerability just make sure you read the cv real carfully ok q whose decision wa it to propose thi product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agency be involve in thi decision thi approach ha be endorse by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet official quick with out look back what name be miss from that list q who wa consult the congres industry a we have on-going discussion with congres and industry on encryption issue and expect those discussion to intensify a we carry out my review of encryption policy we have brief member of congres and industry leader on the decision relate to thi initiative the person who agree with u and who think there be a buck in it for them q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturer a the government design and develop the key acces encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product manufacturer product manufacturer can acquire the microcircuit from the chip manufacturer that produce them the reverse engineer provision of the act could be relevent here q who provide the clipper chip a mykotronx program it at their facility in torrance californium and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturer the program function could be license to other vendor in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption device a we expect several manufacturer to consider incorporate the clipper chip into their device you do not unles you be one of the person q if the administration be unable to find a technological solution like the one propose would the administration be will to use legal remedy to restrict acces to more powerful encryption device a thi be a fundamental policy question which will be consider during the broad policy review the key escrow they miss the word secret here he need a grammar lesson too mechanism will provide american with an encryption product that be more secure more convenient and le expensive than other readily available today but it be just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration be develop i would say le secure le conveniant more expensive pgp be free le available and more prone to be comprimised proof to the contarary will be welcome note proof the administration be not say since encryption threaten the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright a some country have effectively do nor be the say that every american a a matter of right be entitle to an unbreakable commercial encryption product they do seem to be say anything that make much sense and thi proposal do prohibit it except in a very limit way and thi be the one explicit reference to personal right it be a denial and ye i do think that the mexican brazilian and canuck be include in clinton et al magnanamou gesture there be a false tension create in the assessment that thi issue be an either-or proposition rather both concern can be and in fact be harmoniously balance through a reason balance approach such a be propose with the clipper chip and similar encryption technique the tension be false the balance be between two repugnant point the right to privacy be hand-waved to non-existance by put it behind the false assessment it be assume that the removal of the right to take what ever step you deem suitable to protect ymy privacy be non negotiable hence be define in the govenment language to be non-existant if you do agree you must be a criminal a only criminal do agree with out law also note the non question if what be here wa not possible q what do thi decision indicate about how the clinton administration policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicate that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunication and compute and be commit to work with industry and public-interest group to find innovative way to protect american privacy help business to compete and ensure that law enforcement agency have the tool they need to fight crime and terrorism it indicate we know that bush drop the ball in squash that nasty insert suitable retoric and will stamp out thi disorderly unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra-national sentiment q will the device be exportable will other device that use the government hardware a voice encryption device be subject to export control requirement case-by-case review for each export be require to ensure appropriate use of these device the same be true for other encryption device one of the attraction of thi technology be the protection it can give to company operate at home and abroad with thi in mind we expect export license will be grant on a case-by-case basi for company seek to use these device to secure their own communication abroad we plan to review the possibility of permit wider exportability of these product thi one be a real giggle in australium or france they will have to reveal the key and the algorithm do think it at the top of my list of thing i must have so the restriction will protect me from salek try to sell me a bill of crock any for any other use it they must be nut good luck folk paul
