from brand stefan brand subject report on privacy-protecting off-line cash available i recently publish a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash system a a technical report at cwi being a phd-student at david chaum cryptography-group my group ha a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash system the report be call contain page and can be retrieve from from the directory the postscript-file be suitable for laserprinter abstract from coverpage we present a new off-line electronic cash system base on a problem call the representation problem of which little use ha be make in literature thu far my system be the first to be base entirely on discrete logarithm using the representation problem a a basic concept some technique be introduce that enable u to construct protocol for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier system a a consequence my cash system be much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system propose previously another important aspect of my system concern it provability contrary to previously propose system it correctnes can be mathematically prove to a very great extent specifically if we make one plausible assumption concern a single hash-function the ability to break the system seem to imply that one can break the diffie-hellman problem my system offer a number of extension that be hard to achieve in previously know system in my opinion the most interest of these be that the entire cash system include all the extension can be incorporate in a set base on wallet with observer which ha the important advantage that double-spending can be prevent in the first place rather than detect the identity of a double-spender after the fact in particular it can be incorporate even under the most stringent requirement conceivable about the privacy of the user which seem to be impossible to do with previously propose system another benefit of my system be that frame attempt by a bank have negligible probability of succes independent of compute power by a simple mechanism from within the system which be something that previou solution lack entirely furthermore the basic cash system can be extend to check multi-show cash and divisibility while retain it computational efficiency cryptographer be challenge to try to break thi system i make a particular effort to keep the report a self-contained a possible nevertheles if you have any question please e-mail to me and i will try to reply a good a i can any comment be also welcome stefan brand cwi kruislaan sj amsterdam the netherland tel e-mail brand
