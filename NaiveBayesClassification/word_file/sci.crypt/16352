from tapani lindgren subject re de salt in article mikel mikel lechner write you could just a well use a character password to perform the encryption of the zero bite one simple method would be to use the first character to encrypt the zero bite and then use the remain character to encrypt the result again the output would still be bite which encode into ascius character would thi method be vulnerable against a birthday attack currently a cracker need to find the only key that produce the give ciphertext he ha to try about key on the average in the propose method the cracker only need any pair of key half if he can store about guess for one half he be likely to find a mathching pair in about guess here i have assume that the des-encryption be reversable if the key be guess is thi so or do the modification of the s-box by the salt bite make it non-reversable probably there be only one key i think there be chance in about that there be two or more key can anyone verify thi but thi do help the cracker much
