from ros anderson subject re tempest re rob stampfli write would a a second monitor of similar type scroll gibberish and adjacent to the one be use provide reasonable resistance to tempest attack we get a tempest receiver in the lab here and there no difficulty in pick up individual monitor their engineer tolerance be slack enough that they tend to radiate on different frequency even where they overlap you can discriminate because they have different line synch frequency you can lock in on one and average the other out the signal be weird in any case with vary polarisation and all sort of interaction with the build just move a fold dipole around be also highly effective a a randomise mean of switch from one monitor to another ros
