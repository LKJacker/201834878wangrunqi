from jon c r bennett subject re idea on clipper jim gillogly jim write in article you write suppose i know how the algorithm work and know the n for my chip but do not know f then by cryptanalysi i might be able to determine f from if law enforcement field e e k u n f not know n would might make thi much harder they bet that you ca do thi even if you know n even if you know e in fact which they try to keep secret if you can find e by grind down the chip presumably you can find f a well but we ca do thi right now with de even know the encryption method without do almost the whole search that be not true with choose plaintext attack de key can be determine without the full search now suppose that i know f either legitimately or not if i know k either because i be involve in the conversation or i know u for a party in the conversation i may now be able to determine u for the other party again they bet that you ca find u give k they claim the encryption be strong trust u i be not will to take that bet if i know f i can also defeat the law enforcement field since i could make my own with a different k then the one i be use knowing f also allow traffic analysi to be perform so i might not know what you be say but i could know who you be say it too i not sure there be a way to shove arbitrary key and datum through ymy chip but if so thi part ok we assume e be unknown you can obviously shove arbitrary datum through ymy chip a for the key it be state that the sesion key exchange be external to the chip so i can pick my key too now i admit that someone try to compute u will not have lot of message to work from but since we have no way of know that the key generation method do not deliberately generate weak key or for that matter that the publish method be in fact use perhap the u will be choose from know weak key for the system they assume that you wo be able to find u no matter how many message you have if they could break u they would need the key escrow bing bing bing bing bing that exactly my point since we cant know that they do not have thi capability the only safe assumption is that they do i admit that most of my cryptographic complaint be probably unfounded but since we cant know one way or the other im not gonig to take their word for it obviously the compromise of f would be a disaster both to law enforcement for whom thi whole thing be design and for the person who believe that it be give them security f be but one number and i sure that alot of person more then know what it be and if some panel of expert be go to check it over for flaw then many more will know f forget grind chip bribery and blackmail work just fine it not clear that the expert will be tell f in fact i be surprise i expect something more of the form of the fip pub describe de so that they could look at the algorithm in general rather than with the specific set of key choose oh come on that like say you could evaluate de without the s-box constant jon
