from psionic haywood j blowme subject new encryption a promise i speak today with the company mention in a washington time article about the clipper chip announcement the name of the company be secure communicatiion technology information will be give at the end of thi message on how to contact them basically they be disturb about the announcement for many reason that we be more specifically however mr bryen of secure communication bring to light many point that might interest most of the reader hi belief be that at t wa make know of the clipper well before the rest of the industry thi be for several reason several of which be a company of at t size could never be able to make a decision to use the new chip on the same day it wa announce month ago they propose use their own chip for at t secure telephone device at t basically blow them off a be not interest at all thi stick them a strange until now also i speak with art melnick their cryptographer he express several concern over the new clipper chip the obviou backdoor will be able to let many person decrypt the code once the key be release to authority the security of the crypto system be lose forever these key can end up in the hand of any agency of the government the fact that the escrowed key never change mean that the algorithm be vulnerable over time to an attacker the classify algorithm may hide another backdoor but he feel that it be probably to keep person from forge fake serial number or change the key themself additionally he feel that the nsa ha probably spend enough time and money in work on a way to keep thi chip from be reverse engineer that he feel that reverse engineer it will be very difficult to do he feel that they have develop a suitable technique to protect the chip from thi attack also he feel that the chip be hardware encode with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip additonally i speak with mr melnick about their algorithm he could tell me much about their new agorithm because it ha be patent yet however he tell me a little the algorithm will be release for public review after patent have be grant for it thi be so the crypto community can see that it be secure the algorithm be call nea for new encryption algorithm the detail be sketchy because now it be hold a a trade secret until the patent wa issue but i wa tell that it will incorporate the follow it will have fast encryption of datum exact spec not give but mr melnick state much faster than what an can put out it be a symmetric cipher just like idea and de it will use bite datum block for encryption like de and idea the key length wa not give to me but mr melnick state that it be adujustable and be more than adequate for security the algorithm be write in c and assembler in software form and can be port to many platform unlike the the clipper chip which be hardware only and can not be make into software thi i consider a definite plu for the nea for widespread use the algorithm will accomodate public key distribution technique such a rsa or diffie-hellman thi will also be support in the hardware chip right now the project cost of the nea chip will be about dollar for each clipper will run each chip that be if it be produce enough which probably wo happen they currently sell a program call c-com that use the algorithm and a special stream protocol that do not divide the encrypt datum into block thi could prevent plaintext attack if you know what the block header be thi program operate at all support speed and use the software implementation of the algorithm most importantly it do not have a backdoor right now the company be afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of busines thi be a very real possibility so they really need help in stop the clipper chip from become a standard if you want to contact them they can be reach at secure communication technology georgia ave suite silver spring md i talk to mr bryen who represent the company he can answer any question you have any factual error occur in thi write up be my own and i apologize for them ahead of time psionic fight the wiretap chip ask me how c craig h rowland amiga pgp key available those who would give up liberty for by request security deserve neither a
