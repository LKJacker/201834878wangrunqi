from hal hal finney subject re steve-b steve brinich write second question why why be such a strange procedure use and not a real rng thi turn those in a kind of bottleneck for system security the only theory that make any sense be that and be either the same for all chip or vary among very few possibility so that anyone try to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the possible serial number about one billion multiply by the number of different combination my interpretation of denning description be that and be choose randomly by agent of the key escrow company at the start of each chip program session i imagine that the chip be in a carrier which will allow them all to be program fairly quickly there would not be a need to transfer chip one at a time into a little pla programmer a some person have envision my gues a to why thi procedure be use be that base the key on the and use a specify algorithm provide an in-principle checkable way to verify that no back door exist in the choice of the random number use to generate the key since we have to trust the escrow company anyway it do not weaken the system to have the key be generate from random seed enter by the escrow agent and since the algorithm for key-generation be public modulo skipjack secrecy then in principle an agent could challenge the procedure ask for and to be expose and run hi own independent calculation of and to verify that that be what be actually be put onto the floppy and ye there be many way in which failure to follow thi scheme could be hard to check the laptop probably will not really be destroy each time hidden camera in the ceiling could see the and enter by the trust escrow agent back door in the chip could allow u to be recover heck each chip could be record with the same u ignore what wa on the floppy hal finney
