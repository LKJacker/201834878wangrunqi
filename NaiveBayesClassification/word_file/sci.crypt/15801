from jim jim gillogly subject re idea on clipper i wa annoy to find that thi guy post my private e-mail response to him but since i believe what i say i defend it anyway in article jon c r bennett write jim gillogly jim write in private e-mail they bet that you ca cryptanalyze e to get u give n but we ca do thi right now with de even know the encryption method without do almost the whole search that be not true with choose plaintext attack de key can be determine without the full search by almost i mean the differential cryptanalysi attack the choose plaintext attack require a detail analysi of about choose plaintext draw from a total of about that need to be run if i understand the situation correctly thi be certainly a break under the mean of the act but do not constitute much le work than the brute force keysearch the rest of hi article assume that we can figure out the skipjack encryption algorithm e by choose the correct datum to send through it and observe the result i wish him joy of it and choose not to try that attack i be not defend the system and in fact be offend by the idea of escrowed key or a secret algorithm become a de facto industry standard however i also object to oppose it for the wrong reason since that weaken the case against it i say in my private e-mail it not clear that the expert will be tell f in fact i be surprise i expect something more of the form of the fip pub describe de so that they could look at the algorithm in general rather than with the specific set of key choose oh come on that like say you could evaluate de without the s-box constant no it quite different the government would have no percentage in choose f to be a weak key since it not to their advantage to have anybody else know it the expert could thu assume that f be no worse than anything else during their analysi totally different situation from unknown s-box again i not say it would be good or satisfactory for the expert to just be give the raw algorithm without the rest of the surround detail regard the chip and protocol and so on simply that i doubt that they would be give all the information jim gillogly trewesday thrimidge
