from smb steven bellovin subject re off the shelf cheap de keyseach machine wa re corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip in article graham toal gtoal write in article smb steven bellovin write thousand ten of thousand do some arithmetic please skipjack ha possible key we do yet know if all bite count that do worry me at all they not go to cheat at something they can get catch at and key size be one of the thing that can be verify externally feed lot of random pair into the chip then try flip random key bite and see what happen to the output we already know what should happen about half the output bite should vary on average from a key change or input change if they be out to build a weak cryptosystem it might be the case that some of the bite be much le powerful than other in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game by contrast de wa design to use each key bite a early a possible the output change rate appear a early a round again though i do think nsa be go to cheat that crudely they likely to get catch remember that they promise to let a committee of outside expert see the cryptosystem design if you assume something des-like a bias subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb the committee can and should run lot of test and retain the output thi can be verify later against the chip and ye the civilian community ha at least some secure storage facility that i do think even nsa can get into without it be notice until fort meade get it transporter work again oop i do think i wa suppose to talk about that the committee member can even retain secure copy of the code in two half which you have to xor together to recover the program seriously there be i think problem with thi whole scheme but the person who invent it be stupid and they be in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirror game far longer than most of u they not go to lie in way that can be detect easily since their credibility be the only thing they can use to sell thi system if they lie about the civilian committee no one will believe them about the absence of other back door if they lie about the key size no one will believe that they have copy the program disk with the u key if they lie about obviou aspect of the strength of the cryptosystem no one will believe the escrow agency be in cahoot with them that be to say that they be lie about all those other thing anyway and i certainly not claim that nsa ca build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee ca find look how long it take for folk to believe that the s-box be sabotage it entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguou report for just such reason but that a subtle point one you ca explain to a senator anyway it look like the key and escrow arrangement be smoke and mirror to cover the way the nsa can regenerate the key from the transmit serial number i do like the unit key generation proces any better than you do however and be suppose to be under control of the same escrow agent if they ca be trust to keep the seed value secure they ca be trust to keep the half-key secure i still do know if or when and change i think i have see something about them be constant but i just reread denning technical information post and it do say anything one way or the other steve bellovin
