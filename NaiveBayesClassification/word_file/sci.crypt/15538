from olson bryan olson cmsc subject re wh proposal from polouse point of view in article tuinstra dwight tuinstra write it might pay to start look at what thi proposal might mean to a polouse agency it just might be a bad idea for them too ok suppose the ny state polouse want to tap a suspect phone they need a warrant just like the old day but unlike the old day they now need to a get two federal agency to give them the two part of the key now what happen if there a tiff between the two escrow house of key become a political bargain chit while i think it be unrealistic to suppose that the federal agency will fail to promptly comply with a court order there be still a good point here local law enforcement will be unable to perform a wiretap without bring in federal agency based on the possibly incomplete understand of the system quote from d denning only the fbi will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer which seem to be need even to identify what escrowed key to request thi move a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level the reason i like thi point be that it may sway or even persuade person who do generally line up with the civil liberty crowd a national polouse force be oppose by person from a broad range of political viewpoint olson
