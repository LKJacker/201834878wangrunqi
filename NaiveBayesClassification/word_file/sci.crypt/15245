from crypt-comment subject cryptography faq technical miscellany archive-name last-modified faq for part technical miscellany thi be the eighth of ten part of the faq the part be mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest we do have the time to send out miss part by mail so do ask note such a refer to the reference list in the last part the section of thi faq be available vium anonymou ftp to a xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroup and every day content how do i recover from lose password in wordperfect how do i break a vigenere repeated-key cipher how do i send encrypt mail under unix pgp ripem pem is the unix crypt command secure how do i use compression with encryption is there an unbreakable cipher what do random mean in cryptography what be the unicity point unicity distance what be key management and why be it important can i use pseudo-random or chaotic number a a key stream what be the correct frequency list for english letter what be the enigma how do i shuffle card can i foil pirate by encrypt my cd-rom can you do automatic cryptanalysi of simple cipher what be the cod system use by vcr how do i recover from lose password in wordperfect wordperfect encryption ha be show to be very easy to break the method use xor with two repeat key stream a type password and a byte-wide counter initialize to the password length full description be give in bennett and bergen and caelli chri gala write someone awhile back wa look for a way to decrypt wordperfect document file and i think i have a solution there be a software company name accessdatum east south orem ut that ha a software package that will decrypt any wordperfect lotu quatro-pro m excel and paradox file the cost of the package be steep price but if you think ymy pw key be le than character or char give them a call and ask for the free demo disk the demo disk will decrypt file that have a char or le pw key how do i break a vigenere repeated-key cipher a repeated-key cipher where the ciphertext be something like the plaintext xor keykeykeykey and so on be call a vigenere cipher if the key be not too long and the plaintext be in english do the follow discover the length of the key by count coincidence see gaine sinkov trying each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those byte which be equal if the two ciphertext portion have use the same key something over of the byte will be equal if they have use different key then le than will be equal assume random byte of key cover normal ascius text the smallest displacement which indicate an equal key be the length of the repeat key shift the text by that length and xor it with itself thi remove the key and leaf you with text xored with itself since english ha about bite of real information per byte stream of text xored together ha bite of info per byte provide plenty of redundancy for choose a unique decryption and in fact one stream of text xored with itself ha just bite per byte if the key be short it might be even easier to treat thi a a standard polyalphabetic substitution all the old cryptanalysi text show how to break those it possible with those method in the hand of an expert if there only ten time a much text a key see for example gaine sinkov how do i send encrypt mail under unix pgp ripem pem here one popular method use the de command cat file compres de uuencode mail meanwhile there be a de jure internet standard in the work call pem privacy enhanced mail it be describe in rfc through to join the pem mail list contact pem-dev-request there be a betum version of pem be test at the time of thi write there be also two program available in the public domain for encrypt mail pgp and ripem both be available by ftp each ha it own newsgroup and each ha it own faq a well pgp be most commonly use outside the usa since it use the rsa algorithm without a license and rsa patent be valid only or at least primarily in the usa ripem be most commonly use inside the usa since it use the rsaref which be freely available within the usa but not available for shipment outside the usa since both program use a secret key algorithm for encrypt the body of the message pgp use idea ripem use de and rsa for encrypt the message key they should be able to interoperate freely although there have be repeat call for each to understand the other format and algorithm choice no interoperation be available at thi time a far a we know is the unix crypt command secure no see there be a program available call cbw crypt breaker workbench which can be use to do ciphertext-only attack on file encrypt with crypt one source for cbw be ftpcb how do i use compression with encryption a number of person have propose do perfect compression follow by some simple encryption method xor with a repeat key unfortunately you can only compres perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible input for all practical purpose it impossible to describe the typical english text beyond coarse characteristic such a single-letter frequency you can build up more and more sophisticate model of ymy input but if the enemy ha a slightly more accurate model he be able to find some redundancy in ymy compress output note that nearly all practical compression scheme unles they have be design with cryptography in mind produce output that actually start off with high redundancy for example the output of unix compres begin with a well-known three-byte magic number that can serve a an enter wedge for cryptanalysi thi be not to say that compression before encryption be inherently a bad idea it just ha to be do very very carefully and by no mean remove the need for strong encryption compression after encryption be silly is there an unbreakable cipher ye the one-time pad be unbreakable see part unfortunately the one-time pad require secure distribution of a much key material a plaintext of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful rather it need to be strong enough to resist attack by likely enemy for whatever length of time the datum it protect be expect to remain valid what do random mean in cryptography cryptographic application demand much more out of a pseudorandom number generator than most application for a source of bite to be cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the nth random bite will be give complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generate the stream and the sequence of through bite for all n up to the lifetime of the source a software generator also know a pseudo-random ha the function of expand a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently random bite thi seed must be large enough not to be guess by the opponent ideally it should also be truly random perhap generate by a hardware random number source those who have sparcstation workstation could for example generate random number use the audio input device a a source of entropy by not connect anything to it for example cat compres foo gife a file of high entropy not random but with much randomnes in it one can then encrypt that file use part of itself a a key for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random string when look for hardware device to provide thi entropy it be important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it look complicate to a human it must be random for example disk operation completion time sound like they might be unpredictable to many person but a spin disk be much like a clock and it output completion time be relatively low in entropy what be the unicity point unicity distance see the unicity distance be an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in the correspond source text and encryption key equal the number of ciphertext bite use ciphertext significantly longer than thi can be show probably to have a unique decipherment thi be use to back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysi ciphertext significantly shorter than thi be likely to have multiple equally valid decryption and therefore to gain security from the opponent difficulty choose the correct one unicity distance like all statistical or information-theoretic measure do not make deterministic prediction but rather gife probabilistic result namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it be likely that there be only a single intelligible plaintext correspond to the ciphertext when all possible key be try for the decryption working cryptologist do normally deal with unicity distance a such instead they directly determine the likelihood of event of interest let the unicity distance of a cipher be d character if fewer than d ciphertext character have be intercept then there be not enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of possible key de ha a unicity distance of character which be le than ciphertext block each block correspond to ascius character thi may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance gife no indication of the computational work require to find the key after approximately d character have be intercept in fact actual cryptanalysi seldom proceed along the line use in discuss unicity distance like other measure such a key size unicity distance be something that guarantee insecurity if it too small but do guarantee security if it high few practical cryptosystem be absolutely imperviou to analysi all manner of characteristic might serve a enter wedge to crack some cipher message however similar information-theoretic consideration be occasionally useful for example to determine a recommend key change interval for a particular cryptosystem cryptanalyst also employ a variety of statistical and information-theoretic test to help guide the analysi in the most promise direction unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistic to cryptanalysi remain classify even the seminal work of alan turing see for some insight into the possibility see and what be key management and why be it important one of the fundamental axiom of cryptography be that the enemy be in full possession of the detail of the general cryptographic system and lack only the specific key datum employ in the encryption of course one would assume that the cium do not make a habit of tell mossad about it cryptosystem but mossad probably find out anyway repeated use of a finite amount of key provide redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thu especially in modern communication system where vast amount of information be transfer both party must have not only a sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic key management refer to the distribution authentication and handle of key a publicly accessible example of modern key management technology be the stu iius secure telephone unit which for classify use employ individual cod crypto ignition key and a central key management center operate by nsa there be a hierarchy in that certain cik be use by authorize cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic key and to perform function such a the report of lose cik thi should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem for public-key system there be several relate issue many have to do with whom do you trust can i use pseudo-random or chaotic number a a key stream chaotic equation and fractal produce an apparent randomnes from relatively compact generator perhap the simplest example be a linear congruential sequence one of the most popular type of random number generator where there be no obviou dependence between seed and output unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a high enough dimension show up a a regular lattice mathematically thi lattice correspond to structure which be notoriously easy for cryptanalyst to exploit more complicate generator have more complicate structure which be why they make interest picture but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all see exercise and what be the correct frequency list for english letter there be three answer to thi question each slightly deeper than the one before you can find the first answer in variou book namely a frequency list compute directly from a certain sample of english text of course any such list will be correctly compute but exactly which list you get depend on which sample wa take the second answer be that the question do make sense what do you mean by english letter the english language be not a fix finite close object that can be exactly characterize it ha change over time it be different between different author any particular message will have different statistic from those of the language a a whole the third answer be that ye no particular message be go to have exactly the same characteristic a english in general but for all reasonable statistical use these slight discrepancy wo matter in fact there an entire field call bayesian statistic other buzzword be maximum entropy method and maximum likelihood estimation which study question like what the chance that a text with these letter frequency be in english and come up with reasonably robust answer so make ymy own list from ymy own sample of english text it will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly what be the enigma for a project in datum security we be look for source of information about the german enigma code and how it wa break by the british during wwius see how do i shuffle card card shuffle be a special case of the permutation of an array of value use a random or pseudo-random function all possible output permutation of thi proces should be equally likely to do thi you need a random function modran x which will produce a uniformly distribute random integer in the interval given that function you can shuffle with the follow c code assume arrlth be the length of array arr and swap interchange value at the two address give for n n n swap arr modran arr n modran x can not be achieve exactly with a simple ranno x since ranno interval may not be divisible by x although in most case the error will be very small to cover thi case one can take ranno modulu mod x call that number y and if ranno return a value le than y go back and get another ranno value can i foil pirate by encrypt my cd-rom someone will frequently expres the desire to publish a cd-rom with possibly multiple piece of software perhap with each encrypt separately and will want to use different key for each user perhap even good for only a limit period of time in order to avoid piracy a far a we know thi be impossible since there be nothing in standard pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identify the user at the keyboard if there be such an identification then the cd-rom could be encrypt with a key base in part on the one sell to the user and in part on the unique identifier however in thi case the cd-rom be one of a kind and that defeat the intend purpose if the cd-rom be to be encrypt once and then ma produce there must be a key or set of key for that encryption produce at some stage in the proces that key be useable with any copy of the cd-rom datum the pirate need only to isolate that key and sell it along with the illegal copy can you do automatic cryptanalysi of simple cipher schneier bruce schneier say accessdatum of orem utah sell product that break the password scheme of a number
