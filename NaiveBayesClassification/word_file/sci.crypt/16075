from tso detlef lannert subject re clipper consider harmful restated and amplify in article wc bill stewart write the serial number will be in a bite block with a bite filler do take a lot to check to see if that be correct depend on whether the filler be a constant make check easy but susceptible to replay or variable timer counter random which make replay harder and can also make it easier for the inquisitor to know if they miss message or get them out of sequence or other interest thing that sort of person might care about i use a secret nope obscure cryptographic encode to expand the bite serial number to a bite block the redundancy hereby introduce can be use to detect tamper clipper signal where some public enemy replace the block by random datum and of course the block would be use to initialise the encryption of the user datum so that at the receive end the correct block must be process in order to have any chance of get the plaintext back for those of you who might want to mangle the block by xor-ing a constant pattern on the transmission line and restore it before feed it into the receive crippler chip i would add further encrypt copy of thi block perhap create by repeat application of the encryption algorithm or so at regular interval during the transmission if the receive chip detect a mismatch it must assume that the line be bad and it will cease to work in ymy own interest you be protect from get faulty plaintext you know it just like a checksum for ymy own safety the monitor agency wo have the famou black box which be need for actual decryption and will be keep by the fbi but nothing prevent them from use special box which will do the redundancy check for the serial number block and consistency check on the embed block within the transmission these box will turn a red light on a soon a they detect a bitstream that violate the correct protocol so do anyone think that you can use the chip and fool about the tap key i bet the developper have provide much better check than those suggest above of course it absolutely crucial that the algorithm and protocol remain secret personally i doubt they will detlef lannert e-mail tso pgp key vium server or finger lannert i be psmith oh you smith be you with a preliminary p which however be not sound
