from smythw william smythe subject re how to detect use of an illegal cipher in article camelot betel robert crawford write jay fenton fenton write how can the government tell which encryption method one be use without be able to decode the traffic in order to accuse me of use an unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both key out of escrow run them against my ciphertext and draw a blank i wa think about thi also it quite possible the system transmit in clear the serial number of the device be use that way they can start a tap get the serial number and use the warrant for the first tap to get the key if they tap someone who apparently use encryption but do find that prefix then they assume it an un-authorized encryption scheme from the limit detail release so far it seem that the clipper chip system must employ some sort of public key cryptography otherwise the key management problem inherent to symetric cipher would make the system unworkable it probably ha some sort of public key exchange that take place at the start of each call that how they would identify the private key in their datum base thi mean that either the nsa ha develop some non rsa public key algorythm or the feed have decide to subsidize pkp rsadsi the former be rather an excite posibility since keep the algorythm secret while make chip implimentation widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard if the feed be force to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that could break rsa stranglehold on public key crypto in the a for my impression of the whole scheme it seem that instead of try to ban strong crypto they be try to co-opt it their contention that they need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggest possible inherent weaknes to the algorythm more likely be that they dont want anyone construct black market device which dont have the key register anyone else notice that in their q a session they talk about release the key only to person with proper autiorization but carefully dance around state that the key will simply have to be supeonaed they seem to be try to keep open the posibility of obtain key without court order even though tap a phone line require one also pick up on their implicit threat of eithe accept thi or we ban strong crypto outright i dont trust thi plan at all and plan to oppose it in all legal way possible bill smythe
