from graham toal gtoal subject re let build software cryptophone for over the internet in article hal hal finney write i try thi code yesterday on my sparcstation elc it take over second to compres second worth of speech thi mean that it need to be optimize by over a factor of before it will be usable in even a half-duplex mode ouch thank for try it i question whether celp be the best approach for thi application it produce great compression but at the expense of tremendou cpu load we want something that can be run on ordinary workstation or even high-end pc without dsp card my gues be that some other algorithm be go to be a better start point ye i not sure if my xposting to make it to here too but i find that a low sample rate at bite per sample plu the pd lossles sound compression code actually do get speech into with a simdgen leave over thi be definitely worth work on folk and shorten work in well under real-time g
