from john kelsey subject how to make the clipper chip and wiretapping le bad i get an idea that would remove most of the political complaint i have about the clipper chip pas a law state that if within a year of performaing a wiretap on someone a polouse agency ha manage to convict the suspect of the crime the wa for then that agency owe the suspect million to repay for lose privacy of course there be still problem with the technical aspect of clipper and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind an attempt to enforce it a a standard but thi would be a way for those in favor of allow continue wiretap to assure u that it will only be use in case where the crime be important and the polouse be all but certain that there really will be a conviction john kj elsey
