from dfl danny subject re why the clipper algorithm be secret in johnl john r levine write quote someone else here the cryptographic protocol though be another matter i see no valid reason for keep it secret and a i hope i show above there be a lot of way to do thing that be quite a bad it just occur to me why the algorithm be secret if it be publish one could then build physically identical clone version of the chip that would interoperate with official clipper chip but the cloner would provide the key to the escrow house hmmn yeah the algorithm be classify because a military contract or similar government equivalent to military ha be let for thi proprietary design that the fed say that nsa develop is there a patent is that patent publicly available my bet be that that too be classify if the algorithm be make public or reverse-engineered it would compromise not only the goal of justice of be able to read every chip user cypto-datum but would reduce profit for the select chip maker would that just be too bad danny dfl panix dfl danny lieberman po box church st station new yawk new yawk usa
