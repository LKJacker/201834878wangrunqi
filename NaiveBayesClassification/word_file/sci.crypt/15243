from crypt-comment subject cryptography faq overview archive-name last-modified faq for part overview thi be the first of ten part of the faq the part be mostly independent but you should read thi part before the rest we do have the time to send out miss part by mail so do ask note such a refer to the reference list in the last part disclaimer thi document be the product of the crypt cabal a secret society which serve the national secu uh no seriously we the good guy and we do what we can to ensure the completenes and accuracy of thi document but in a field of military and commercial importance like cryptography you have to expect that some person and organization consider their interest more important than open scientific discussion trust only what you can verify firsthand and do sue u many person have contribute to thi faq in alphabetical order eric bach steve bellovin dan bernstein nelson bolyard carl ellison jim gillogly mike gleason doug gwyn luke tony pattus william setzer we apologize for any omission if you have suggestion comment or criticism please let the current editor know by send e-mail to crypt-comment we do assume that thi faq be at all complete at thi point archive ha be archive since october on though these archive be available only to and canadian user please contact crypt-comment if you know of other archive the section of thi faq be available vium anonymou ftp to a xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroup and every day table of content overview net etiquette what group be around what a faq who be i why be i here do political discussion belong in how do i present a new encryption scheme in basic cryptology what be cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key what reference can i start with to learn cryptology how do one go about cryptanalysi what be a brute-force search and what be it cryptographic relevance what be some property satisfy by every strong cryptosystem if a cryptosystem be theoretically unbreakable then be it guarantee analysis-proof in practice why be many person still use cryptosystem that be relatively easy to break mathematical cryptology in mathematical term what be a private-key cryptosystem what be an attack what the advantage of formulate all thi mathematically why be the one-time pad secure what a ciphertext-only attack what a known-plaintext attack what a chosen-plaintext attack in mathematical term what can you say about brute-force attack what a key-guessing attack what entropy product cipher what be a product cipher what make a product cipher secure what be some group-theoretic property of product cipher what can be prove about the security of a product cipher how be block cipher use to encrypt datum longer than the block size can symmetric block cipher be use for message authentication what exactly be de what be triple de what be differential cryptanalysi how wa nsa involve in the design of de is de available in software is de available in hardware can de be use to protect classify information what be ecb cbc cfb and ofb encryption public-key cryptography what be public-key cryptography what rsa is rsa secure how fast can person factor number what about other public-key cryptosystem digital signature and hash function what be a one-way hash function what be the difference between public private secret share etc what be and what be snefru technical miscellany how do i recover from lose password in wordperfect how do i break a vigenere repeated-key cipher how do i send encrypt mail under unix pgp ripem pem is the unix crypt command secure how do i use compression with encryption is there an unbreakable cipher what do random mean in cryptography what be the unicity point unicity distance what be key management and why be it important can i use pseudo-random or chaotic number a a key stream what be the correct frequency list for english letter what be the enigma how do i shuffle card can i foil pirate by encrypt my cd-rom can you do automatic cryptanalysi of simple cipher what be the cod system use by vcr other miscellany what be the national security agency nsa what be the u export regulation what be tempest what be the beale cipher and be they a hoax what be the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch is rsa patent what about the voynich manuscript reference book on history and classical method book on modern method survey article reference article journal conference proceed other how may one obtain copy of fip and ansi standard cite herein electronic source rfc available from ftprf related newsgroup
