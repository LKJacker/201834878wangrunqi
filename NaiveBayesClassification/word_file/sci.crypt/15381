from john kelsey subject competing standard perhap one way of get away from thi cripple chip that the government seem to be push would be to come up with a good alternative for example how about a scheme use rsa and some hybrid of des-cfb and another strong stream cipher maybe idea-cfb thi could be substantially the same a the cripple chip except that instead of key-registration the polouse could demand that you give up ymy secret key to them with a court issue warrant then they could read the last few month of wiretapped message you send and assume you commit no crime you could generate a new key pair and go about ymy busines i find that i be will to pay rsa for the right to use such a system especially give the alternative if you be unwilling to give up ymy secret key then you probably stay in jail ha anyone get a real legal precedent for thi thi would allow court-issued warrant to be use to gather information on suspect criminal but it could be do in secrecy and there would be enormously le likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed key maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct me but thi do seem like such a big los in term of law-enforcement capability any comment john kelsey
