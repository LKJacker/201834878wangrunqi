from brad brad templeton subject re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key-escrow interestingly enough in design the escrow we may want to use some rather unusual technology such a seal box of paper or destructive read memory rather than typical computer databasis which be fun for a database of hundred of million of key the greatest danger of the escrow database if it be keep on disk would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out you can design lot of protection but with enough corruption a complete copy be alway possible storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense or a medium that ca be copy for example something with very slow acces time or which leaf a destructive trail if it be even read of course then it hard to backup however i think the consequence of no backup the datum be not there when a warrant come be worse than the consequence of a secret backup an audit trail that reveal when datum ha be acces that be erase by the human involve be also necessary brad templeton clarinet communication corp sunnyvale ca
