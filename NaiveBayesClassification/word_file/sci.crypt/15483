from pmetzger perry e metzger subject facinating fact bite serial number possibly fix and denning vidkun abraham lauritz quisling write each chip include the follow component the skipjack encryption algorithm f an family key that be common to all chip n a serial number u an secret key that unlock all message encrypt with the chip hmmm a thirty bite serial number and we be tell the unit key u be derive deterministically from thi serial number that mean that there be only one billion possible unit key to generate the unit key for a serial number n the value n be first pad with a fix block to produce a block and be then use a key to triple-encrypt produce a block e d e similarly n be pad with two other block to produce and and two additional block and be compute e d e e d e and be then concatenate together give bite the first bite be assign to and the second bite to the rest be discard the unit key u be the xor of and and be the key part that be separately escrowed with the two escrow agency hmmm we must assume that generate the unit key u from the serial number n rather than generate it from a randomly select and be an intentional way of assure a fail safe for the government u be completedly determine give and n if and do not change they constitute effective master key along with f the theft of which or the possession of which by variou authority completely obviate the security of the system however more interestingly we know for a fact that if and be fix no matter what the keyspace for u be no more than why not pick and at random why thi interest restriction of they key space if it not to provide an additional back door i find it disturb that at the very best my security be dependant on approximately byte worth of information that could be write on the back of a napkin even if and change periodically the rationale behind thi restriction in the size of the keyspace seem strange if one be assume that the goal be security and make perfect sense if the goal be an illusion of security if and do not change even if they remain secret i wonder if they can somehow be back-derived give enough unit number pair we be assure that thi can not happen but no one understand how skipjack work outside of government official and soon foreign intelligence service that gain the information vium espionage presumably we will eventually have the information a well reverse engineer get more and more advance every year but by the time we know it may be too late a a sequence of value for and u be generate they be write onto three separate floppy disk the first disk contain a file for each serial number that contain the correspond key part the second disk be similar but contain the value the third disk contain the unit key u agent take the first disk and agent take the second disk the third disk be use to program the chip after the chip be program all information be discard from the vault and the agent leave the laptop may be destroy for additional assurance that no information be leave behind none of thi make me feel the least bite secure the silly notion of destroy the laptop appear to be yet another bizarre distraction we all know that you ca read datum from dram that ha be turn off for more than a few moment on the other hand what we do know be why there be a need to generate the unit key from and in the first place other than to weaken the system we do know if the agent in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information it probably worth hundred of million so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist and to tell you the truth do thi in a vault rather than in joe random tempest-shielded room with a laptop computer seem like melodrama design to make high-school dropout from peorium impress but it do very little for most of the rest of u the protocol may be change slightly so that fmy person be in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seed and and the second two the escrow agent would take the disk back to the escrow agency what would thi provide let say the escrow agency be the aclu and the nra and their agent personally take back the disk and be alway honest who care the nsa must be laugh out loud because they have the algorithm to regenerate u give n and likely do need to steal they key a they effectively already have them perry metzger pmetzger laissez faire laissez passer le monde va de lui meme
