from smb steven bellovin subject re off the shelf cheap de keyseach machine wa re corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip in article jebright jame r ebright write now why be that i doubt there be a trapdoor in skipjack but we will never know and i doubt the nsa would promote a ma market chip they could compromise ergo nsa be now capable of compromise probably with brute force keysearch engine of the complexity of skipjack look at the spec why i bet they have thousand of little chip chug away in their crypto buster maybe even ten of thousand complexity not much more than a how many such machine will fit into fort meade i think should have bite idea key thousand ten of thousand do some arithmetic please skipjack ha possible key let assume a brute-force engine like that hypothesize for de microsecond per trial million chip that trial per second or about year for trial well maybe they can get chip run at one trial per nanosecond and build a machine with million chip sure only year for each solution idea use key shall i bother do the calculation for you hint multiply year by and you ca do idea at that speed key setup take much too long i would be surprise if that be the case for skipjack too though there no way of know just yet de use only xor because that what wa feasible with technology modern chip can do a lot more nsa may or may not know how to crack skipjack and idea i doubt it for the former i have no idea for the latter though it do seem to be a strong cryptosystem but it ai gon na be by exhaustive search
