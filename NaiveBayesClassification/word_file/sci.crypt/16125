from pom prof dr klau pommerening subject summary de init vector a additional key at the risk of get lose in the clipper chip discussion i give a summary on my recent question in article pqscbcnh i write the recent discussion in thi news group suggest that a key search attack against de be quite feasible now but normally de be apply in cbc or cfb mode where one choose a random init vector of byte question make it sense to handle the init vector a an additional key then we have a bite key if ye is anything know about the security of thi key scheme can we break it faster than by exhaustive search through the bite key space unfortunately the answer be no conceal the initialisation vector essentially do give any additional security i get answer from grady smb that open my eye it pretty simple say e be encryption and d decryption with key k on block let c be the initialisation vector m m the message block c c the cipher text block then encryption in cipher block chain cbc mode work by the formula c i e m i xor c and decryption by m i c xor d c i so if the attacker do have c thi only affect the first message block m but she can do her key search attack on m m the situation in cipher feedback cfb mode be a bite more complicate but similar and leave a an exercise for the reader finally there be the modify output feedback mode ofb where de or whatever block cipher you use simply act a random generator by s i e s with initialisation vector seed s and encryption be give by c i m i xor s i here the usual know plaintext attack against xor-bitstream cipher reduce the crack to key search for k klau pommerening institut fuer medizinische statistik und dokumentation der johannes-gutenberg-universitaet obere zahlbacher strasse mainz germany
