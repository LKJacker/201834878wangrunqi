from mjr marcu j ranum subject re how to detect use of an illegal cipher how can the government tell which encryption method one be use without be able to decode the traffic in order to accuse me of use an unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both key out of escrow run them against my ciphertext and draw a blank i wa think about thi also it quite possible the system transmit in clear the serial number of the device be use that way they can start a tap get the serial number and use the warrant for the first tap to get the key if they tap someone who apparently use encryption but do find that prefix then they assume it an un-authorized encryption scheme thi do handle superencrypted traffic if the clipper do impose any unfortunate performance side-effect there no reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple-de encrypt traffic that way ymy traffic look normal and perhap anyone desire to listen in wo even bother since they know nobody go to really trust crypto that ha classify internal for important stuff mjr
