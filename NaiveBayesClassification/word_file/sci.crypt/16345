from tenney glenn s tenney subject re help some nut be threaten to sue i do wish to rehash the pgp patent issue at all but i do feel that some potential misconception in interpretting intellectual property law need to be raise in article arthur rubin write if pgp violate rsa patent then only execute pgp could be a violation distributing pgp could be contributory infringement but the pgp documentation seem sufficient to me to protect distributor before i delete it use pgp might be a patent violation in the u so i have no need to keep it you be correct that execute pgp would be a violation unles the patent be declare invalid by the court but there be a question a to when how or if distribute pgp would be a violation if the person or company distribute pgp receife money for do so then it be clearly a sale for example if it be on compuserve they charge you for acces so they would be sell pgp when there be no charge for pgp thing get le clear but there would still be a reasonable view that it be induce an infringement nb re jim bidzo you have no legal action you can take unles you believe you can prove someone be use pgp in the u for a purpose other than that specifically allow by patent law not entirely correct anyone can sue for any reason but you can not prevail unles you can prove that by a prepoderance of evidence under patent law pgp do have legitimate use a a mean to study ymy algorithm in order to produce improvement which would still require ymy approval to execute until the patent run out around thi be a common misconception the patent law do not mention any valid purpose for infringe a patent although it be clear that in order to create a new invention either base on a prior patent or to avoid infringe a prior patent one must perform research on an exist patent to just say that you infringe a patent assume we not talk the rsa patent only for research purpose wink wink nudge nudge and then never develop any relate invention ie only use it would be a clear infringement glenn tenney voice fax tenney ham radio
