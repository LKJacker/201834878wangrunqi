from fw forrest d whitcher subject summary response research on oracle password security my original post wa i be build an oracle database to serve a a repository for information which be consider proprietary or confidential a such i want to verify the security of oracle password and apply some of the same security check technique we use on my nix system specifically i would like to use crack or something like it to check the encrypt datum for easily guess password the use of would depend on oracle use the unix password encryption scheme do anyone know if thi be the case or what method be use any other method for security check audit in the oracle environment would be much appreciate thi article will just scratch the surface of a few security consideration comment be request email fw my thank to the person who respond both on usenet and from oracle corp the most common response wa to suggest use of oracle audit feature or op password to control acces opinion on op include suggestion to use and not use i wa also advise to use table view to refine the granularity of acces control one important security consideration in network installation be that op account presume that the client host provide user authentication server op user be only a secure a the least secure machine on the network hence you should probably not define any op account on system with pc or limit acces of op account to datum with no security concern unix oracle server provide for disable op acces over the network orasrv option while rely on host security for local process internally oracle provide powerful and well document sic audit mechanism which the dba will use to monitor system and datum acces these tool can be use to track the primary security risk from within the oracle environment oracle password security be base on a proprietary usage of de encryption oracle corp state that the algorithm be not prone to cleartext attack thi be a difficult claim to substantiate since the algorithm be unknown the concern here be that if user choose easily guess password if a cracker can gain acces to ymy oracle database file through the host operate system could extract the password datum and apply cryptanalysi technique to learn the user password a security risk go the above scenario be pretty low severity certainly once an intruder ha acces to the raw database file can acces to the datum in them if a cracker could break the password however could do substantial damage without alert the audit mechanism and leave and audit trail which would point to valid user at present oracle like unix provide no native mean of ensure that password be not guessable a with all computer security the most important defense be to educate user in the safe choice of password these technique be well discuss in internet rfc and the crack manual both available from ftp archive server and unix r system security curry david a addison-welsey forrest whitcher fw boston scientific corp watertown ma
