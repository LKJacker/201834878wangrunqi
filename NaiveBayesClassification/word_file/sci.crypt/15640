from andyl andy latto subject re off the shelf cheap de keyseach machine wa re corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip in article smb steven bellovin write in article graham toal gtoal write in article smb steven bellovin write thousand ten of thousand do some arithmetic please skipjack ha possible key we do yet know if all bite count that do worry me at all they not go to cheat at something they can get catch at and key size be one of the thing that can be verify externally feed lot of random pair into the chip then try flip random key bite and see what happen to the output we already know what should happen about half the output bite should vary on average from a key change or input change if they be out to build a weak cryptosystem it might be the case that some of the bite be much le powerful than other in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game by contrast de wa design to use each key bite a early a possible the output change rate appear a early a round again though i do think nsa be go to cheat that crudely they likely to get catch consider a cryptosytem that start out by xoring bite and and not use either of these bite except through thi xor thi system make early use of every bite but an exhaustive key search would now only have key to search ymy test by vary single key bite would turn up anything interest remember that they promise to let a committee of outside expert see the cryptosystem design if you assume something des-like a bias subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb the algorithm i suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb but i sure i could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy which wa well-hidden but would still make an exhaustive key search take far le than encryption i do believe ymy claim that the real keysize can be verify externally andy latto andyl
