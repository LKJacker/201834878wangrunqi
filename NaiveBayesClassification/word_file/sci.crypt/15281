from grady subject powerful similarity too a unix tool of cryptographic significance be available for anonymou ftp agrep a fast approximate pattern-matching tool source code project available from in directory agrep agrep be a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendou number of powerful search option the one most obviously applicable to cryptography key selection be to be able to specify the similarity of match in the datum for example say you make up a of of course you rightly suspect that thi key itself be not in any dictionary or word list but how close be it to en entry that could be vary by some crack program to brute-force search for it you use agrep to find out looking with argument for none one or two error no match good so far but agrep bigwordandphraselist find that the pattern be too close to the pattern imsel part of himself and a host of other to be of any cryptographic value a a key an error of level two correspond to a simple transposition of letter like teh for the a minimally acceptable password would have to pa a least level in order not immediately ruled-out a even a remote possibility of be a good password in real cryptographic use my personal passphrase clear at least level on my rather large meg word and phrase list and for search for key word in human-typed datum lot o typo the tool be unexcelled for example for example say i want to find out what person think about gibson sf book neuromancer in the huge sf-lover archive even with an error distance specification a small a of i will find all those person who think the title wa necromancer or other common typo why mi anything also the program can look for up to pattern in parallel at boyer-moore sublinear speed great for a nsa wannabe to look for ymy name terrorist name special tagalog or religiou word etc in the news or e-mail spool directory you can even search for ciphertext by use say random three-byte combination and eliminate all text that do score the x chi-square hit on message size y you think some crypto-terrorist be try to foil you by change the pattern on you no problem try agrep p nsa to find nsa national security agency nsecag no such agency national scrabble association etc you can also specify fix area look for license plate when you know that the letter be correct you might say agrep xyz licenseplatedatabase will find all plate start with xyz with up to two error addition substitution deletion in the number area you can also weight the relative cost for substiution addition or deletion error for example when search dna pattern for a particular protein combination you might know that some kind of damage cause the a nucelotide to drop out more than other error you could adjust for thi bia by set dc where you set the deletion cost to count a c error a steganographic use i even use agrep steg eograp e just now to find the correct spell would be to intentionally introduce error of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it vium an agrep pipe lot of possibility here when only outlaw can have ciphertext also with agrep powerful extraction option it make it easy to abstract the hit into a useful form for example agrep d from say output the entire mail record delimit by that contain and contain either or and agrep ha be measure an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available a usual i will be glad to e-mail the source and doc to those who reqest them by e-mail if they can not do an anonymou ftp get thi now it be too powerful to stay in the hand of the nsa grady ward vendor to the nsa and proud of it grady ad fc ac
