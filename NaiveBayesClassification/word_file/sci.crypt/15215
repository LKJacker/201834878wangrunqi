from philip philip gladstone subject more clipper stuff a of yet there ha be no description of the general principle behind the clipper proposal for example be thi a public key system or a private key system if the latter then i do see how the system could work give that the key be tie to the device and not the person further the escrowed key be split into two chunk i would gues that the availability of one of these chunk and a reasonable key-search machine would allow you to read the traffic i not suggest that thi be a deliberate weaknes of the system but it do make you think of course thi be easily fixable by give out two chunk which could be x-ored to generate the real key philip
