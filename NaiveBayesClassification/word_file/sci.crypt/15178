from l detweiler subject privacy anonymity on the internet faq of archive-name last-modified version note on anonymity on the internet compiled by l detweiler what be some know anonymou remailing and post site what be the responsibility associate with anonymity how do i kill anonymou post what be the history behind anonymou post server what be the value of anonymity should anonymou post to all group be allow what should system operator do with anonymou post what be go on with maintain by j helsingiu what be some know anonymou remailing and post site currently the most stable of anonymou remailing and post site be operate by julf for several month who ha system adminstrator privilege and own the equipment including anonymized mail usenet post and return address no encryption send mail to help for information hal finney ha contribute an instruction manual for the cypherpunk remailer on the ftp site see also unix script to aid remailer use and msdo batch file to aid remailer use ebrandt anonymized mail request information from above addres experimental anonymou remailer run karl barru with encryption to the server request information from that addres hal experimental remailer with encryption to server and return address request information from above addres hh hh hh experimental remailer include header request-remailing-to nowhere experimental remailer allow one level of chain run by chael hall request information from above addres phantom experimental remailer with encryption to server finger site addres for information note cypherpunk remailer tend to be unstable because they be often run without site administrator knowledge liability issue be wholly unresolved so far all encryption be base on public-key cryptography and pgp software see the question on cryptography encryption aspect message text destination addres reply vary between site multiple chain alia unlinking and addres encryption be mostly untested problematic or unsupported at thi time what be the responsibility associate with anonymity user use anonymity only if you have to frivolou use weaken the seriousnes and usefulnes of the capability for other do not use anonymity to provoke haras or threaten other do not hide behind anonymity to evade establish convention on usenet such a post binary picture to regular newsgroup if post large file be attentive to bandwidth consideration remember simply send the post to the service increase network traffic avoid post anonymously to the regular hierarchy of usenet thi be the mostly likely place to alienate reader the alt hierarchy be prefer give a much information a possible in the post reference etc remember that content be the only mean for reader to judge the truth of the message and that any inaccuracy will tend to discredit the entire message and even future one under the same handle be careful not to include information that will reveal ymy identity or enable someone to deduce it test the system by send anonymized mail to yourself be aware of the policy of the anonymou site and respect them be prepare to forfeit ymy anonymity if you abuse the privilege be considerate and respectful of other objection to anonymity hit-and-run anonymity should be use with utmost reservation use service that provide anonymou return address instead be courteou to the system operator who may have invest large amount of time be personally risk hi account or dedicate hi hardware all for ymy convenience operator document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable use in an introductory file that be send to new user have a coherent and consistent policy and stick to it state clearly what log and monitor be occur describe ymy background interest and security measure will the general approach be totalitarian or lassaiz-faire formulate a plan for problematic ethical situation and anticipate potentially intense moral quandary and dilemma what if a user be blackmail someone through ymy service what if a user post suicidal message through ymy service remember ymy user trust you to protect them in the site introductory note give clear example of situation where you will take action and what these action will be warn the user limit anonymity to email or post only revoke the account the user contact local administrator etc describe exactly the limitation of the software and hardware addres the bandwidth limitation of ymy site report candidly and thoroughly all bug that have occur work closely with user to isolate and fix bug addres all bug note below under in stability of anonymity document the stability of the site how long ha it be run what compromise have occur why be you run it what be ymy commitment to it include a disclaimer in outgo mail and message include an addres for complaint ideally append to every outgo item consult a lawyer about ymy liability be commit to the long-term stability of the site be prepare to deal with complaint and hate mail address to you if you do not own the hardware the system run on or be not the system adminstrator consult those who do and be be considerate of provide anonymity to variou group if possible query group reader keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgo message format that can be screen effectively by kill file ensure the key text anon be somewhere in every header take precaution to ensure the security of the server from physical and network-based attack and infiltration reader do not complain attack or discredit a poster for the sole reason that he be post anonymously make blanket condemnation that equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality or assail anonymou traffic in general for mostly neutral reason it volume be heavy or increase react to the anonymou information unemotionally abusive poster will be encourage further if they get irrationally irate response sometime the most effective response be silence notify operator if very severe bus occur such a piracy harassment extortion etc do not complain about post be inappropriate because they offend you personally use kill file to screen anonymou post if you object to the idea of anonymity itself avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymou post should be bar from particular group because no possible or conceivable need exist reference see thi article be an excerpt from an issue of fidonews on individual privacy and the use of handle it accept the need of a system operator to know the name of a user but suggest that the use of a handle be analogou to a request to withhold the name in a letter to the editor the article conclude with a set of guideline for preserve the right to be anonymou how do i kill anonymou post jame thoma green jgreen try put thi in ymy kill file j j thi will search the header of the message and kill any that contain anon or anonymou in them not perfect and wo kill followup note that anonymou server operator have the capability to mask anonymou post under which the above method will not work so far thi practice be not widespread but it may become more common a a countermeasure to widespread anonymou filter what be the history behind anonymou post server originally anonymou post service be introduce for individual particularly volatile newsgroup where anonymity be almost the prefer method of communication such a and one of the first wa one by dave mack start in for another early one wa run by stephanie gilgut gilgut enterprise but wa disband due to lack of fund the system provide anonymou return address john opalko take up the function of thi server include reinstate the anonymou alia file the group ha be chew through server like there no tomorrow spurred by the disappearance of wizvax and interest in research the idea karl kleinpaste develop hi own system from scratch in six hour by thi time the idea of extend the server to new more mainstream group wa start to emerge and he explore the possibility partly at the specific request by multiple user for anonymity in other group the intend advantage of my system wa specifically to allow multiple group support with a single anon identifier acros all thi wa arguably the single biggest deficiency of previou anon system k kleinpaste post a message on ask user whether an anonymou service would be welcome there and judge a consensu against it k kleinpaste introduce what he call a fire extinguisher to squelch or plonk abusive user in response to complaint and use thi in three case nevertheles after a few month of intense traffic he wa eventually overwhelm by the bus of hi server even a restrict a it wa my system wa subject to bus to the point where it wa order dismantle by the facility staff here such bus start right after it wa create in nov johan helsingiu julf set up the most controversial anonymou site to date be base on script and c code write by k kleinpaste and support anonymized mail post and return address he initially want to confine the service to scandinavian user but expand it to worldwide accessability in response to of international request j helsingiu policy of allow anonymou post to every usenet newsgroup ha be meet with strong and seriou ideological opposition by news adminstrator in because of the relative newnes and recent emergence of the medium bus by anonymou poster tend to have higher visibility than routine bus hi total commitment to preservation of anonymity be also controversial for example in a highly controversial and publicize case in feb an anonymou user post a suppose transcript of desperate crew dialogue during the challenger shuttle disaster vium to despite that the transcript have be post in the same place up to a year earlier then non-anonymously and actually originate not with the poster but a new york news tabloid subsequent response consist largely of vociferou outrage at the poster use of anonymity reverberate through many newsgroup the original poster use the same anonymou handle later concede that the story seem likely to have be fabricate suggest the plausible possibility that the original intent wa not to provoke outrage but gauge reaction on the authenticity of the story albeit crudely free of personal risk from perceive association with the item the ensue commotion generate query for the original article by late-entering reader the anonymou user later post deliberately offensive comment at hi detractor despite piercingly irate and outrage complaint and even the vocal opposition and verbal abuse of k kleinpaste and eminent news operator j helsingiu ha largely avoid use of the fire extingisher and the group bouncer mechanism that limit the scope of the service a of march the site be best describe a inundate it ha register over user in it initial three month of operation forward message a day and approximately of all usenet post be anonymized through the site the immense popularity be probably largely due to the capability for global anonymity which ha allow user to find creative use in diverse area not previously envision johan helsingiu ha be subject to extraordinary pressure to dismantle hi server in feb at one point k kleinpaste threaten publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate news operator to send out revocation command on all message originate from the site j helsingiu ha also allude to threat of flood the server the server ha crash several time at least once due to a saturation mailbombing through it by an anonymou user mr helsingiu report spend up to hour per day answer email request alone associate with the service administration in response to the seriou threat he disable global group acces temporarily for one week and encourage hi user to defend the service publicly based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestion by cypherpunk j helsingiu ha identify many security weakness and valuable new feature for the service and be currently in the proces of code development and test he be plan on upgrade the ibm compatible machine to a soon to handle the voluminou load and be consider integrate a new system with very sophisticate functionality include multiple email alias alia allocation control public-key encryption etc a very sophisticate anonymou post system wa set up in dec by d clunie dclunie that use cryptography in both direction the server for the highest degree of confidentiality see so far however it wa run on a public acces account and he have to shut it down after only several week upon receive request and condition apparently ultimately originate from nsf representative d clunie ha release the software to the public domain recently the idea of a newsgroup devote to whistleblowing on government bus ha receive wide and focus attention and group formation be currently underway in the basic scenario the group would allow person to post pseudonymously use remailer and even establish reputation base on their authentifiable digital signature the traffic may eventually reach reporter in the mainstream news medium deltorto ha volunteer to attack multiple aspect of thi project include distribute easy-to-read documentation on post anonymization and encryption see also section on view on anonymou post below and what be go on with in thi document thank to carl kleinpaste david clunie dclunie and johan helsingiu julf for contribution here what be the value of anonymity kondared i think anonymou post do help in focus my attention on the content of one message sure lot of anonymou post be abusive or frivolou but in most case these be by user who find the anon facility novel once the novelty wear off they be stop their prank morgan we morgan i do mind see the miscellaneou those thing be part of my nature however the notion of provide anonymity shield for these idea repulse me if they have such strong feel why ca they put their name s on their post quite frankly i loathe communication with person who refuse to use their name dclunie david clunie many seem to question the value of anonymity but who be they to say what risk another individual should take there be no question that in thi rather conservative society that we live in hold certain view make certain statement adopt a certain lifestyle be likely to result in public censure ridicule los of statu employment or even legal action given the heterogeneity of the legal jurisdiction from where the many contributor to usenet post who know what be legal and what be not some say that anonymou poster be coward and should stand up and be count perhap that be one point of view but what right do these detractor have to exercise such censorship from doug doug sewell why be it censorship to not expect someone to speak for themself without the cloak of anonymity thi be at best a lame argument you tell me why what you have to say require anonymity and you tell me why the wish of a majority of non-anonymou user of a newsgroup should be disregard when they do want anonymou post anonymou user have les right than any other they be not legitimate usenet participant i would not honor rfd cfv control message or vote from one brad brad templeton i can think of no disadvantage cause by anon post site that do already exist other than the fact that they do make more naive net user who do know how to post anonymously the old way more prone to do it from mandel tom mandel i can not speak for other but i regard anonymou post in a seriou discussion a pretty much worthles view that hide behind the veil of anon be hardly worth the trouble of read hank pankey since i begin post anonymously to show support for general principle of personal privacy i have be subject to far more abuse and attack than i ever receive before person seem to find it easier to flame and insult someone whose name they do know perhap it easier to pretend that there be no person behind the email addres who feel the sting of abusive comment anonymity do hinder some method of control other poster action person who seek such control will naturally oppose it from instead of make thi a free-er medium by allow poster to protect themself with anonymity simply require that all poster be prepare to discus their source of information and take the heat for unsubstantiated dribble thi seem to be the way thing be currently do xtkmg kate gregory in there be three thread go on start by anonymou poster one wa about change job so a to work le hour job share and so on from a woman who do want anyone at her current place of work to know she wa think of look for work elsewhere the next wa from a woman who be think of have a baby sometime soon and do want coworker friend family etc etc to know all about it but who want advice the third be about sex after parenthood actually thi wa start by person post in the usual way but then it wa point out that the anonymou post service might let more person participate do seem to be suffer any harm from the presence of anonymou poster in fact it seem to have be help by it hoey dan hoey while there ha never be any real security against anonymou or forge post on usenet the proces ha until now be sufficiently inconvenient error-prone and undocumented to limit it use by person who have not learn the culture of the net on the other hand a recent use of the anonymou post service on seem seem to be a student ask help on a homework problem it ha now be attribute to a teacher ask for an explanation of a dubiou answer in hi teach guide he say hi news post be break so he be use the anonymou service a a mail-to-news gateway karl barru some argue that the opinion of the person who hide behind a veil of anonymity be worthles and that person should own up to their think i agree with the latter point in an ideal world we would all be sit around engage in socratic dialogue freely exchange my opinion in an effort to learn but in an ideal world nobody will threaten you for ymy think or ridicule you but we live in a world where the person who do agree with you may try to harm you let face it some person be go to agree with ymy opinion no matter how logically you try to present it or how reason out it may be thi be sad since it do restrict person from voice their opinion red richard e depew the consensu seem to be that a general anonymou post service such a that at seem sufficiently corrosive of the trust and civility of the net that thi particular experiment should be end perhap the next time the question come up we can say we try it we learn it do more harm than good and we stop it from alexander eichener anonymou post ha not create major problem aside from anger irate person like you who would rather ban post altogether because real man can stand up for what they say or comparable puerile argument a other have bring up dave dave haye what a primal example of human nature i have three question for you folk do person really say different thing to each other base upon whether their identity be or be know are person really so affect by what other person say that the verbage be label abuse most importantly on a forum that prize itself on the freedom of communication that it enjoy be there really such a thing a freedom of communication from terry terry mcgonigal sigh just how many anon service be need will everybody start run one soon what the purpose who stand to benefit when there be n anon service then then out there where ha thi sudden fasination with anon service come from for better or imho worse it look like gon na get stick with these thing and a much a i do like the idea of service like thi become the norm i do really think there much to be do since it obviou that anyone who want to can set one up with a bite of work karl kleinpaste weak reason with freedom come responsibility dave dave haye responsibility be real if it be enforce true responsibilty come with no coercion should anonymou post to all group be allow morgan we morgan i will be the first to admit that i hold some controversial opinion indeed i sure that none of u be completely orthodox in my opinion however i receive hundred of anonymou email message over the last few year fewer than of them be reasonable post make with good motive it get more and more difficult to remember why we need anonymity at all the abuser be once again lousing thing up for those who truly need the service or those who would put it to good use i not suggest that we should ban anonymou server a i say there be several situation in which anonymity be a good thing tm however the notion that anonymity shield should be automatically extend to every usenet discussion be ridiculou it open the door to further abuse twpierce tim pierce of course how do one determine whether a group request the service a flat majority of poster vote in favor a positive margin of vote or what no one speak for a newsgroup i not convince by the argument that an anonymou post service for all newsgroup be inherently a bad idea simply because it a diversion from the statu quo since the statu quo previously permit anonymou post to no newsgroup any anonymou post service would reject the statu quo hartman richard m hartman write it be facist to suggest that a newsgroup be best able to decide whether it want to allow anonymou post instead of have them force upon them by an service administrator ogil brian w ogilvie the service provide a mechanism for forward mail to the original poster since most usenet reader do know john smith from jane doe except by their opinion and their addres the effect of have an anonymou post to which mail reply can be direct be minimal except for those who personally know the poster and the lack of anonymity could be seriou any mechanism like thi be liable to abuse but the benefit a well a the cost must be weigh limiting the service to alt group or specific group would not help those who want advice on sensitive issue in more newsgroup from tarl tarl neustaedter an additional point be that some of u find anonimity in technical matter to be profoundly offensive anonimity in different forum ha different mean if i get a phone call from someone who wo identify himself i hang up if i get mail with no return addres it go into the garbage unopened if someone accost me in the street while wear a mask i back away carefully and expect violence in a technical discussion anonimity mean that the individual be will to associate himself with the matter be discuss which discredit hi utterance and make listen to them a waste of time anonimity lead to fun psych experiment the literature be fill with all the variou thing that person will do anonymously that they wo otherwise including one notoriou study involve torture that would not have pass today ethical standard fun stuff in any case fine leave u out of it from jbuck joe buck you obviously have never submit an article to a referee journal where you will receive anonymou review through a server the editor that behave much like the one in finland you may reply and the editor will maintain the anonymity ymy comparison of someone who want to expres on a technical issue anonymously with a person who approach you on a dark street with a ski mask be just emotionally overwrought nonsense such poster pose no physical threat to you jik j kamen it seem obviou to me that the default should be not to allow anonymou post in a newsgroup the usenet ha alway operate on the principle that the statu quo should be keep unles there a large number of person who want to change it if someone really need to post a message anonymou in a newsgroup in which thi usually be do they can usually find someone on the net to do thi for them they do need an automate service to do it and the automate service be by it nature incapable of make the judgment call necessary to decide whether a particular post really need to be anonymou from twpierce tim pierce for any newsgroup you name i bet i can envision a scenario involve a need for secrecy if an accurate content-based filter of each anonymou post could be devise to screen out those that do require secrecy wonderful but it ca be do from lhp lasse petersen if a newsgroup want to be noise and nuisance-free then it should call for moderation thi should happen on a per-newsgroup basi and not a a general usenet ban on anonymou post of course one principle of moderation might be to keep out all anonymou post and could be achieve automatically it would still be moderation personally i would prefer moderation criterium be base on actual content david a clunie dclunie if a group do want to receive certain post it should become moderate there be clearly define mechanism on non-alt group for thi to take place an automate moderator exclude post from certain eg anonymou site or individual could easily be establish if anyone want to take such a draconian approach then they be welcome to do so and good luck to them i doubt if i will be read their group from dave dave ratcliffe what possible need would someone have for post anonymously to a scus group sure most adult be will to post under their own name why would they want to hide behind an anonymou post service ashamed of what they have to say or just try to rile person without fear of be identify anonymou post have their place in certain group if i or anyone else need to tell you what those group be then you be on another planet breathe exotic gas for too long from it bloody fascinate that all the proponent of unimpeded universal anon post acces ca seem to find any middle grind at all why be there such a perception of absolutism where do thi instant gratification syndrome come from i want anon acces and i want it now who be the control freak here from remember thi be a newsgroup for poster write about scientific issue anonymou discussion of scientific issue lead to bad science from noring jon noring though many have personal philosophical argument against anonymou poster their argument have not be compel enough to convince me that omni-newsgroup anonymou post should be ban or severely restrict though i can not prove it it seem to me that those who do not like anonymou post in principle do so for reason that be personal read psychological discomfort rather than for reason relate to maintain the integrity of usenet remember it be impossible to be able to ascertain all the conceivable and legitimate motive for anonymou post to newsgroup one normally would not deem to be sensitive in general i fear even let newsgroup reader vote on either allow or not allow anonymou post since a priorus they can not know all the motive of legitimate poster and i do not believe that any system should ever be institute that would inhibit the post of legitimate and informative post lestat lyle j mackey write i personally do believe that pseudonymou post be appropriate in a seriou discussion area if there be a legitimate reason for conceal the poster identity perhap but simply because they not so sure if they want their name attach do qualify a legitimate in my book oh and if you can come up with a legitimate purpose for anonymou post please enlighten me sderby stuart p derby three of my the found father madison hamilton and jay seem to think anonymou post wa ok the federalist paper be originally print in new york newspaper with authorship attribute to publiu i wonder if you would find their purpose legitimate what should system operator do with anonymou post from emcguire ed mcguire i would like to know how to junk all article post by the anonymou service currently be discuss ideally i would actually tell my fee site not to fee me article post by the anonymou service assuming the c news performance release what be a simple way to accomplish thi or where should i look to learn how to do it myself from dclunie david clunie that a bite draconian be it have ymy user unanimously decide that they would like you to do thi or have you decide for them from emcguire ed mcguire good question nobody ha decide i have no definite plan to do thi just want the technical datum carl kleinpaste be i to be in the position of offer such a service again my promise of protection of anonymity would be limit not on the basi of personal opinion of what get post but on the basi of post which disrupt the smooth operation of the usenet the most obviou and direct recourse would be to out the abusive individual les drastic possibility exist the software support a fire extinguisher by which individual can be prevent from post john john hascall since when be usenet a democracy if someone want to run an anonymou service that their busines if you want to put that host in ymy killfile that ymy busines if a newsadmin want to blanket-drop all post from that site that between them and the other person at that site if everyone ignore a service the service effectively do exist from jik jonathan i kamen nntp server that allow post from anyone be not a service to the net they do the net a disservice terminal server have the same problem a open nntp server they allow person who want to do thing on the internet to do so without accountability there be by now public acces site all over thi country if not all over the world that allow very inexpensive acces to the usenet and the internet there be no reason for nntp server to allow anyone to post message through them and there be no reason for terminal server to allow anyone to connect to them and then make outbound connection through them perhap when it wa harder to get to the internet or the usenet open server could be justify but not now jbotz jurgen botz i think that what these point show clearly be that an anonymou post service ha a great deal of responsibility both toward it client and toward the net a a whole such a service should imho have a set of well-defined rule and a contract that it client should sign under the term of which they be assure anonymity from is the problem that some be use to punish poster who be upset in some vague way by complain to the usually acquiescent sysadmin or organization that the poster belong to that surely be the most gutles approach to solve problem but my experience on the net show that the same user who vilify anonymou post be the first to write obsessively detail grievance to the poster supervisor when hi or her tranquility be disturb by some intrusive or subversive post or another anonymou post prevent just thi kind of intimidation from gandalf eric schilling the main point i would like to make here be that while we can go through and revise the news sw to reject anon post to technical newsgroup or some such thing i think the attempt will prove futile each attempt to modify news can result in a change approach by anon service provider to thwart the change i think thi would be pointles from julf johan helsingiu i have try to stay out of thi discussion and see where the discussion lead but now i rally feel like i have to speak up i have repeatedly make clear that i do block user if they continue their abuse after have be warn in many case the user have take heed of the warn and stop and in some case even apologize in public and when the warn ha not have the desire effect i have block a number of user i have also block acces to group where the readership ha take a vote to ban anonymou post although i feel change the newsgroup statu to moderate be the only permanent solution for newsgroup that want to formalize discussion red richard e depew do thi mean that you be volunteer to issue a request for discussion to ban anonymou post or to moderate each of the newsgroup that ymy server can reach i do think so but thi illustrate the trouble that ymy server be cause please listen to the consensu of the news administrator in thi group any newsgroup should be consult before let ymy server post message to that group from alexander eichener there be no pompou consensu of the news administrator here maybe you would like to invent one there be a sizeable number of person who be concern about the possible and to a minor extent about the actual abuse of the server a it be configure now these concern be respectable johan be deal with them there be some few who rage with foam before their mouth and condemn the service altogether and a number who defend it point out like kate gregory that even a group like can benefit from pseudonymou post from julf johan helsingiu i have answer a lot of personal mail relate to server abuse and a a result of that block a number of abusive user i have also withdraw the service from several newsgroup where the user have take a vote on the issue i have not make any comment on partly because the newly-implemented password feature a a emergency measure against a security hole ha keep me really busy answer user query the last two week and partly because i feel it be not for me to justify the service but for the user the problem with be that the readership be rather elective represent person whith a strong interest in centralise control from hartman richard m hartman thi seem to be a rather bigoted attitude i would consider that thi group be for anyone who wish to discus how the net should be control saying that we only have an interest in centralize control be a clear indication of bia you be perfectly welcome to join in the discussion here to promote ymy view on control jbuck thi whole debate be a lot of sound and fury signify nothing because even if you all decide to ban anonymou post server it be not enforceable the only person who conceivably could enforce retriction be those that control the international link policy change should be make by cooperation not by attempt to dictate you need to persuade those who run the service to act like thi through friendly persuasion not by try to beat them over the head with a stick especially a stick you do even have spp steve pope i be find thi bia against pseudonymity bore my friend post through penet ha a point the old guard would like to keep their network the way it alway ha be and thi new thing these pseudonymou server cut into their turf so they whine and bitch about it and every time there the slightest abuse such a somebody sig be too long they try to parlay that into an argument against pseudonymity i go on record a say three cheer for the admin at anon server like penet pax and and for all the acces service provider who be will to preserve their client privacy and a pox on those who try to defeat and restrict pseudonymity mimir al billing i would help person get rid of anon post a a group if you do like what someone say then you put that anon addres in ymy kill file not all of them of course if and when i get an anon site go i just go to assign fake name like jsmith instead of to avoid most of the hassle you never know it be anonymou will you from anne anne bennett i must admit to some astonishment at thi argument i see the value of anonymou post under some circumstance yet believe strongly that these should be identify a such so that person who do not wish to read material from person who wo identify themself do have to i fail to see what good you would be accomplish and indeed surmise that you will cause many person inconvenience and annoyance by hide the anonymity of post from ymy anonymou site would you care to justify where the hell you get the gall to try to prevent person from effectively filter their news a they see fit from dclunie david clunie i think i wa out of reach here in australium too unfortunately one of the u site involve in the fee complain to the australian academic reasearch network through whom my site be connect not about anything in particular just the concept of anonymou mail have no redeem feature and consume a narrow bandwidth link with which i ca argue and that wa that stop the service or face disconnection i consider the demise of my service to have be rather unfortunate and i wish the finnish remailer luck it be a pity that there be very few if any similar service provide with in the u i gues that the benefit of have a constitution that guarantee one freedom of speech and a legal and political system that conspire to subvert it in the name of the public good what be go on with run by j helsingiu from funny how beat the rest of the usenet over the head with a stick be ok if it and universal anon acces but somehow person on the other side of the same equation not even argue to shut it off entirely but rather just to have some control apply to the bus that manifest themself be allow to do that i have write to johan several time in the last couple of week he use to reply to me quite readily after all i wa the source of the software a originally deliver to him he use to be downright prompt about reply to me funny now he be an impolite bastard who do answer mail even when it consist of really very civil query from julf johan helsingiu in ymy mail you tell me you send me one or more message on feb feb and the server wa down and the flood of mail that result from the server come up again crash my own mail host the problem wa aggregate by an abusive user send thousand of message to another user fill up that user mailbox the bounce message end up in my mailbox overflow my local disk a well i can only suppose that ymy message get lose in that hassle a i have try to answer a much a possible of the anon-related message i get from routine mis-addessed message to complaint about the service on the average i spend hour per day answer anon-related message from why be it that everybody else ha to put up with the impolitenes and insensitivity of the misuse of whose definition of polite and sense apply and why why be universal anon acces consider to be within the realm of thi fuzzy concept of politenes in the first place i think johan ha long since cross the line into be a rude bastard and i tell him so in private mail a little while ago at thi point i deeply regret a have create an anonymou system support newsgroup and b have give the code to johan i do copyright it but i think that some concept of politenes and good sense might follow it to new home interesting that johan idea of politenes and good sense seem to have nearly no interesection with mine i could even cope with universal anon acces if johan would be will to engage in abuse control but somehow that seem to be outside the range of reality from julf johan helsingiu there be no way for me to convey how sad and upset ymy message make me i do to some extent understand ymy feel but it still feel really bad running the server require get use to a lot of flame but mindlessly abusive hate mail be so much easier to deal with than something like thi a i do respect and value ymy view and opinion to a high degree no i not ask for sympathy i just want you to know that i be really give ymy view quite a lot of weight when i ask for the software i wa actually only go to provide the service to scandinavian user but a lot of person request that i keep the service open to the international community i now realize that i ought to have contact you at that point to ask how you feel about me use ymy stuff in such a context again i really want to apologise and i will replace the remain few piece of code thet still stem from ymy system unfortunately there be no way to remove the idea and structure i get from you again i be really sorry that the result of ymy work end up be use in a way that you do approve of and i will be give a lot of hard think to the possibility of shut down the server alltogether from i think i feel especially rude and impolite if it good for johan it good for me after all he do ask the greater usenet whether universal anon acces wa a good idea he just do it ye i a seriously rude pain in the a now and i think i arm the usenet death penalty slightly modify not for strategic whole-site attack but tactical assault just an destruction only outside alt too let say to parrot thi line person have be do thing like the udp that be cancel other post for year no one could ever stop them and it only politenes and good sense that ha prevent them up to now in fact i have person who have express privately the desire and ability to arm the udp ps no in fact there be not newsadmin ready to arm the udp it would be amuse to know how many person gulp hard when they read that though i do see it a any different from johan configuration pp now that i calm some fear by the above ps there be newsadmin ready to arm the udp they ask for my code i have send it yet only one site would be necessary to bring to a screech halt anyone can implement the udp on their own if they care to politenes and good sense prevent them from do so i wonder how long before one form of impolitenes bring on another form from julf johan helsingiu it would be trivially easy to bring to a screech halt in fact it ha happen a couple of time already but a we be talk threat here let me make one a well a very simple one if somebody use something like the udp or maliciously bring down by some other mean it will stay down but i will let the user know why and name the person who do it ok a somebody say on thi thread you have to take personal responsibility for
