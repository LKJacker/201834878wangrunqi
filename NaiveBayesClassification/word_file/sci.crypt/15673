from carl carl shapiro subject re estimating wiretap in article hanson robin hanson write a rough estimate suggest that wiretap be worth about five million dollar per year to law enforcement agency in wiretap lead to arrest while total polouse expenditure of billion lead to million arrest ref u statistical abstract i work on estimate thi wiretap benefit more accurately but you seem to be assume that all arrest be of equal value and that the use of wiretap be spread uniformly among them given thi comparatively tiny number of wiretap and the associate difficulty and cost involve judge technician etc i expect that law enforcement reserve the use of wiretap for the most valuable case since the value of an arrest can vary over an enormou range eg jaywalk ma murder i think ymy million estimate may be too low by a couple of order of magnitude
