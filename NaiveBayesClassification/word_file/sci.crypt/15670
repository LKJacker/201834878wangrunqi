from denning subject revised technical summary of clipper chip here be a revise version of my summary which correct some error and provide some additional information and explanation the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning revised april introduction on april the president announce a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communication while meet the legitimate need of law enforcement at the heart of the plan be a new tamper-proof encryption chip call the clipper chip together with a split-key approach to escrowing key two escrow agency be use and the key part from both be need to reconstruct a key chip content the clipper chip contain a classify single-key block encryption algorithm call skipjack the algorithm use bite key compare with for the de and ha round of scramble compare with for the de it support all de mode of operation the algorithm take clock tick and in electronic codebook ecb mode run at mbit per second each chip include the follow component the skipjack encryption algorithm f an family key that be common to all chip n a serial number thi length be subject to change u an secret key that unlock all message encrypt with the chip the chip be program by mykotronx inc which call them the the silicon be supply by vlsi technology inc they be implement in micron technology and will initially sell for about each in quantity of or more the price should drop a the technology be shrink to micron encrypting with the chip to see how the chip be use imagine that it be embed in the at t telephone security device a it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after push a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an session key k with the device at the other end thi key negotiation take place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be use such a the diffie-hellman public-key distribution method once the session key k be establish the clipper chip be use to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitize voice the telephone security device fee k and m into the chip to produce two value e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which be transmit over the telephone line the law enforcement field thu contain the session key k encrypt under the unit key u concatenate with the serial number n all encrypt under the family key f the law enforcement field be decrypt by law enforcement after an authorize wiretap ha be instal the ciphertext e m k be decrypt by the receiver device use the session key d e m k k m chip programming and escrow all clipper chip be program inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which be essentially a vault the scif contain a laptop computer and equipment to program the chip about chip be program during a single session the scif be locate at mykotronx at the begin of a session a trust agent from each of the two key escrow agency enter the vault agent enter a secret random value into the laptop and agent enter a secret random value these random value serve a seed to generate unit key for a sequence of serial number thu the unit key be a function of secret random bite where each agent know only to generate the unit key for a serial number n the value n be first pad with a fix block to produce a block and be then use a key to triple-encrypt produce a block e d e similarly n be pad with two other block to produce and and two additional block and be compute e d e e d e and be then concatenate together give bite the first bite be assign to and the second bite to the rest be discard the unit key u be the xor of and and be the key part that be separately escrowed with the two escrow agency a a sequence of value for and u be generate they be write onto three separate floppy disk the first disk contain a file for each serial number that contain the correspond key part the second disk be similar but contain the value the third disk contain the unit key u agent take the first disk and agent take the second disk thu each agent walk away know an seed and the key part however the agent do not know the other bite use to generate the key or the other key part the third disk be use to program the chip after the chip be program all information be discard from the vault and the agent leave the laptop may be destroy for additional assurance that no information be leave behind the protocol may be change slightly so that fmy person be in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seed and and the second two the escrow agent would take the disk back to the escrow agency the escrow agency have a yet to be determine but they will not be the nsa cium fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement ha be authorize to tap an encrypt line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get acces to the communication line let u assume that the tap be in place and that they have determine that the line be encrypt with the clipper chip the law enforcement field be first decrypt with the family key f give e k u n documentation certify that a tap ha be authorize for the party associate with serial number n be then send vium secure fax to each of the key escrow agent who return also vium secure fax and and be xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u be decrypt to get the session key k finally the message stream be decrypt all thi will be accomplish through a special black box decoder capstone the next generation a successor to the clipper chip call capstone by the government and by mykotronx ha already be develop it will include the skipjack algorithm the digital signature standard ds the secure hash algorithm sha a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer a prototoype will be available for test on april and the chip be expect to be ready for delivery in june or july acknowledgment and distribution notice thi article be base on information provide by nsa nist fbi and mykotronx permission to distribute thi document be grant
