from nagle john nagle subject re key registering body since the law require that wiretap be request by the executive branch and approve by the judicial branch it seem clear that one of the key register body should be under the control of the judicial branch i suggest the supreme court or regionally the court of appeal more specifically the office of their clerk court already operate substantial record-keeping operation some of these record be confidential so the concept of a court hold information in confidence in accordance with law ha longstanding legal precedent the judiciary be more immune to pressure from the executive branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be so judicial control of key be appropriate for the other half of the key i suggest a unit of congres the general accounting office the gao be congres staff unit for keep tab on the executive branch and ha an excellent reputation it control strictly by congres the executive branch ha no authority over it with key split between the legislative and judicial branch we might have a chance of thi system work honestly if of course a way can be find to keep the key from be siphon off before they reach the repository thi should not be construe a an endorsement by me of the whole clipper concept but if we have to have it split control acros all three branch of government might make it work john nagle
