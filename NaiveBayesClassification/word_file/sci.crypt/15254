from crypt-comment subject cryptography faq digital signature archive-name last-modified faq for part digital signature and hash function thi be the seventh of ten part of the faq the part be mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest we do have the time to send out miss part by mail so do ask note such a refer to the reference list in the last part the section of thi faq be available vium anonymou ftp to a xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroup and every day content what be a one-way hash function what be the difference between public private secret share etc what be and what be snefru what be a one-way hash function a typical one-way hash function take a variable-length message and produce a fixed-length hash given the hash it be computationally impossible to find a message with that hash in fact one ca determine any usable information about a message with that hash not even a single bite for some one-way hash function it also computationally impossible to determine two message which produce the same hash a one-way hash function can be private or public just like an encryption function here one application of a public one-way hash function like or snefru most public-key signature system be relatively slow to sign a long message may take longer than the user be will to wait solution compute the one-way hash of the message and sign the hash which be short now anyone who want to verify the signature can do the same thing another name for one-way hash function be message digest function what be the difference between public private secret share etc there be a horrendou mishmash of terminology in the literature for a very small set of concept when an algorithm depend on a key which be publish we call it a private algorithm otherwise we call it a public algorithm we have encryption function e and decryption function d so that d e m m for any message m we also have hash function h and verification function v such that v m x if and only if x h m a public-key cryptosystem ha public encryption and private decryption checksum such a the application mention in the previou question have public hash and public verification digital signature function have private hash and public verification only one person can produce the hash for a message but everyone can verify that the hash be correct obviously when an algorithm depend on a private key it mean to be unusable by anyone who do have the key there no real difference between a share key and a private key a share key be publish so it private if you encrypt datum for a friend rather than for ymy eye only be you suddenly do shared-key encryption rather than private-key encryption no what be and and be message digest function develop by ron rivest definition appear in rfc and rfc see part code be available from ftpmd note that a transcription error wa find in the original draft rfc the correct algorithm should be call though some person refer to it a what be snefru snefru be a family of message digest function develop by ralph merkle be an function the newest in the family definition appear in merkle paper code be available from ftpsf
