from mjr marcu j ranum subject re let build software cryptophone for over the internet graham toal gtoal write ye i not sure if my xposting to make it to here too but i find that a low sample rate at bite per sample plu the pd lossles sound compression code actually do get speech into with a simdgen leave over thi be definitely worth work on folk and shorten work in well under real-time i do think that thi should be work on just in the context of cryptography that sure to pose all sort of problem for all sort of person what need be for someone to develop a portable telephone quality speech converter imagine if you will a little box that take datum on it serial port and put out sound and take sound and code it to signal on it serial port full duplex now thi device be not a cryptographic device it a portable poor man sound blaster or whatever you want to call it it get load of perfectly legitimate application for a speech synthesi with a few nifty library and some sample b speech record for electronic message c build voicemail system d internet talk radio e internet relay chat of course some of the electronic message in item b might be encrypt possibly realtime but that the user decision one would need of these talky box and a pair of modem and some kind of cutout to switch over and some code on say a laptop i really like to see such a thing develop so that interactive internet talk radio could be do ideally though it should be a general purpose device it should be a general purpose enough device that nobody should be able to balk at it widespread use obviously to make it easy for homebrewer it should use pretty common hardware it interest to note that i already talk with a couple of folk about build such a thing before thi whole clipper thing start i even go so far a to track down a couple of folk who be able to make sample unit give incentive and some time i envision find a couple of folk interest in such a project and help fund development of a public domain board layout and part set that could be publish in the form of cad draw for a couple of major cad package and in postscript anyone interest i start a provisional mail list let me know if you want on mjr
