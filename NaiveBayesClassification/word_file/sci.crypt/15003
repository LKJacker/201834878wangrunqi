from ray ray berry subject re hard drive security for fbi target ros anderson write in article cuffell tim cuffel write thi suggest a new pc security product design approach first fill the hard drive with random file and file encrypt under a number of know key then whenever a new secret file be create you delete a random file and replace it with real encrypt datum new non-secret file be encrypt under a know key better yet instead of thrash around on the do file system take it a step further write yourself a minimal file system program that be use to file them to ramdisk list a directory put the util password protect on a floppy the catch be that the storage space use by thi util be not part of the do file system instead defrag ymy disk thu pack all allocate cluster into cluster then use the back end of the partition to hold ymy file system or leave a small partition on the disk that be not assign to do another approach might be to use a directory that contain a set of invariant file do system file for instance due to do allocate a minimum storage unit of a cluster there be unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of it associate cluster these dead space could be concatenate and use to hold ymy stealth file system now you have a situation where no encrypt datum appear on ymy disk at all ray berry ray rjberry
