from rlglende robert lewi glendenning subject re screw the person crypto be for hard-core hacker spook only in article fdl ifarqhar ian farquhar write in article ameline ian ameline write i also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread any back door or weakness would further discredit the scheme and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative there be company one in canada a i recall which specialize in analyze chip to understand proces technology design rule to understand the probable yield of the assembly line make them and therefore the probable current cost and possible future cost curf give design shrink statistical quality control better yield etc taiwanese japanese and especially korean semiconductor manufacturer have all korea continue reverse-engineered foreign chip and produce the chip taiwan and japan have sign intellectual property treaty and now at least extract the level design before lay the chip out again the korean still use mask-level copy i believe at least they be under a lot of pressure to pa law to meet international intellectual property standard all thi despite lot of attempt to hide the design there be lot of technique to do so in both hardware and software design for a complex chip there will be real intellectual effort extract the gate design from the transistor design and the algorithm from the gate design but it wo take two smart guy even month work hmy week korean work or more lew lew glendenning rlglende perspective be worth iq point niel bohr or somebody like that
