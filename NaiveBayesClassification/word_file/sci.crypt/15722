from throopw sheol subject re clipper consider harmful from shirriff ken shirriff message-id oeh it seem likely to me that that a large subset of encrypt communication would be archive to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arise and a warrant be obtain i think it be unlikely that datum like thi could be use in court currently lea can install wiretap on large number of phone record call without listen to them and then post-facto obtain warrant and listen to call after probable cause be establish but thi strategy would get the stuff admit in court at least not in the near term in other word near a i can tell the thing that make such evidence inadmissable be the interception without a warrant not the attempt to interpret what wa intercept without a warrant i be surprise that archive datum without consent would be interpret a anything but analogou to a wiretap by the court note that that do mean i think it wo be do if technically feasible just a i sure many wiretap be do now without warrant just to fish for avenue to investigate so in the future start surveilance start archive datum trump up some probable cause decrypt post-facto after the warrant be in hand and the investigation get a boost from datum that sadly wo ever be present to a jury while i post for an interest cautionary tale project thi archive scenario to extreme read lacey and hi friend a collection of sf story by david drake the u start down the slippery slope by archive everyghing but do worry folk it store in a secure repository where nobody but lea with warrant can get to it and by the way we be instal camera on all major street hey thi be nothing new we already have camera in bank and teller machine do we and then we pa law require camera cover all public place then in some private place then we make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera except in legally license privacy cubicle only alone and with a thorough body search before and after but see there still a right to privacy we have curtail any right not really and just think how much easier it be to solve crime in such a situation just obtain a warrant put on a vr helmet and take a walk down memory lane and hey nobody be track you or me no need to be self-consciou after all if you not do anything illegal funny though while speed and the radar detector industry become pretty much a thing of the past somehow all thi do elminate all crime in the story and somehow politician get exemption on grind of national security and rich corporation get exemption for their exec on grind of industrial espionage and the preservation of competition and not everybody wa exactly happy with the system i ca imagine why wayne throop throopw sheol throop aurgate
