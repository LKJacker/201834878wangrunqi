from tomw tom weinstein subject re revised technical summary of clipper chip in article denning write each chip include the follow component the skipjack encryption algorithm f an family key that be common to all chip n a serial number thi length be subject to change u an secret key that unlock all message encrypt with the chip to see how the chip be use imagine that it be embed in the at t telephone security device a it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after push a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an session key k with the device at the other end thi key negotiation take place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be use such a the diffie-hellman public-key distribution method once the session key k be establish the clipper chip be use to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitize voice the telephone security device fee k and m into the chip to produce two value e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which be transmit over the telephone line the law enforcement field thu contain the session key k encrypt under the unit key u concatenate with the serial number n all encrypt under the family key f the law enforcement field be decrypt by law enforcement after an authorize wiretap ha be instal one very interest thing i notice about thi be that the only use of the chip key be to encode the session key for the law enforcement field it be not use at all by the encryption algorithm it seem like it would be possible to create a device that would be otherwise compatible but would send out a bogu law enforcement field thi might render the device unusable with normal device if there some sort of validation involve the law enforcement field but it could certainly be use with other such modify device of course thi be irrelevant if the nsa ha a backdoor in the algorithm but it do make it possible to defeat the key escrow system wilt thou seal up avenue of ill pay every tom weinstein debt a though god write the bill emmerson tomw
