from marc vanheyningen mvanheyn subject how do it really work wa re text of white house announcement and q a on clipper chip encryption thi announcement be somewhat disconcert it do do anything evil in and of itself but bode badly for the future of open algorithm and standard in information security i wo start panic de or rsa or stuff like that be prohibit but i a little anxiou no doubt it wo be long before someone post explain how thi just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived nsa-pkp-irs-fbi-cia-handguncontrolinc-clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom democracy and mathematics my feel be that the administration probably be that worry about thing like de and rsa and pgp and ripem since they never be use by a group much wider than u computer geek the fact that thi just come out now suggest one of two thing the nsa ha be work on thi for a long time and it only just now happen to be ready to release to the world at thi time the nsa ha be work on thi for a long time but wa able to get the bush administration to go along with thi plan i find it unlikely that thi would have be because of a sympathy for the unescrowed use of cryptography more likely the administration felt that even escrowed secret-algorithm and for all we know trivially breakable cryptography should not be make widely available thu say clipper clipper chip announcement thi new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of datum transmit electronically at the same time thi technology preserve the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agency to intercept lawfully the phone conversation of criminal the majority of the discussion involve thi clipper chip seem to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversation do anyone know if that mean thi chip be design to work primarily with analog signal the language sort of suggest thi but it hard to say the main thing i just do get be whether thi chip implement symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic technique anybody know i guess symmetric but they do get very clear about it if it be symmetric how be it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end how can you negotiate a per-session key use symmetric cryptography without use a trust third party who know ymy key or do it even use a per-session key if it asymmetric what about pkp patent which they claim cover all method of do asymmetric cryptography are they get royalty or be hide infringement the real reason for keep the algorithm secret marc vanheyningen mvanheyn mime ripem accept kirk i wo hurt you alien you hit me kirk well i wo hit you again
