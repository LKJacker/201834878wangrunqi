from rdippold ron asbesto dippold subject re do we need the clipper for cheap security gtoal graham toal write can someone tell me if hardware compression be or be not need to run digital speech down i think it be i hear it not let say bite sample would raw datum at the correspond sample rate be usable if not how fancy do the compression need to be a good vocoder like our will give you bite per second lock at full rate it a variable rate voice activity vocoder if you want le quality cut that to bp half rate at full rate variable you could put two full-duplex conversation on a modem thi require a dsp or asic though an ha a cpu that could probably do it in real-time because it ha the add-and-multiply instruction and a few other dsp thing if you want to do speech in real-time you need about sample a second for not very good voice with ymy bite sample isdn be sample a second which be kbp you could do a fast compression on that to get it down to kbp which be just about the quality at thi point be very bleah but it should work now add in the time for ymy encryption method you go to need sample hardware which be no problem on a new mac an amiga or a pc with a soundblaster card just because they so popular and cheap you could also build a simple adc the problem with the soundblaster be that it do seem to be full duplex you ca sample and play backq at the same time make a two-way conversation a bite tough the special hardware or a more capable sound card may be require the only thing that worry me be that compression the soundblaster can do it automatically in hardware but other than that i do have a good feel for how processor intensive it be so i ca estimate how fast a pc you need not all man who drink be poet some of u drink because we be not poet
