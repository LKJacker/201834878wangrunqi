from pla paul l allen subject re clipper two additional possible problem begin pgp signed message in article cliftonr pope clifton write if i want to talk to someone i do need to have previously exchange key with him i just call him up and the phone establish a session key for u use a zero-knowledge algorithm or something of the kind if i misunderstand thi part it probably invalidate the rest of thi notion thi lend itself to spoof i go buy a pair of clipper phone to go on a pair of phone line in a back room somewhere and have the digital switch program to redirect hi call to one of my two line instead of to hi whenever he receife a call the two phone be wire back-to-back in the clear anyone see any problem with thi scheme other than to assume that all public official and phone company employee be totally incorruptible a far a i can see no matter how the session key be generate be it diffie-hellman or whatever any cripple conversation which travel in whole or in part over a land-line be vulnerable to thi scheme law enforcement agency can do it legally at the telco or illegally by find some part of the phone line that they can cut into the degree of risk depend very much on location not good in the middle of a busy street but not bad on a line in open country lead to a drug lord ranch the only way to defeat it would be if ymy phone have the equivalent of a public key index against phone number for every phone you might want to call all of them totally impractical even if some part of the cripple algorithm could be use a a kind of public key i do understand enough about these thing to know thi sort of encryption scheme be only really workable over a radio link and even then you could probably interevene without cause problem for other phone nearby if you be physically close to the target phone gosh yet another way to get round cripple encryption how many be that we find so far and that without even know the detail of the algorithm paul begin pgp signature version ybqiegkrbcg end pgp signature
