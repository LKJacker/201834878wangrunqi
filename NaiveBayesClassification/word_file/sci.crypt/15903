from brad brad yearwood subject re clipper consider harmful restated and amplify in article pmetzger perry e metzger write you obviously have read the information about the system the chip put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow themself to be identify the system do not rely on register person a own particular phone unit i be against the proposal but let be accurate in my objection do not presume to tell me what i have and have not read the system may not rely upon register person a own particular phone unit but it be necessary to know which phone unit be likely to be use for some suspect criminal communication before you can obtain their unit key from escrow thi necessity raise the stake in favor of a criminal coerce or collude use of some other person clipper phone i will restate my assumption more explicitly and amplify my argument the original title perhap should have be distinction between legal and illegal cipher system consider harmful but clipper consider harmful be not inaccurate and be more eye-catching in the current context assumption clipper be make available law be pass to make use of cipher system other than clipper illegal either on radio system or on any common carrier system these law also include enforcement authority to listen acros the relevant radio spectrum or other medium characterize signal validate clipper wrapper detect probable use of non-clipper cipher and make such detection a cause for further action for escrowed key to be useful some specific clipper chip must be associate with a suspect criminal thi mean that at a minimum some association between the common carrier unique phone id esn and the clipper chip serial number n will be store in a government database an observe pair of n and esn other than the one record raise a red flag to reduce ordinary fraud the cellphone system which offer clipper will also be construct with an esn mechanism much more tamper-proof and much le spoofable than today cellphone criminal want inscrutable communication some criminal be not entirely stupid or ignorant and will figure out both that clipper cellphone offer excellent security in normal circumstance and that they offer no security against law enforcement once a presumably legitimate wiretap order exist they will also figure out that the wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone because each one ha a unique unit key criminal do not want to call attention to themself because they be not stupid or ignorant or because they read netnews and because they know that their open use of a non-clipper cipher be likely to be detect they will generally avoid use non-clipper cipher directly on some channel they know that do so would raise a red flag put a give cellphone if not a give person under immediate suspicion it be impractical to reverse engineer skipjack discover family key f and construct a functional clone of a clipper chip by and it will be very difficult to spoof a give clipper phone without immediate detection because it be difficult to obscure one association to a specific phone by reprogramming or change chip around the criminal will be motivate to find an intact phone which be associate with someone else a non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have clipper-secure communication at least for some limit time t if they buy beg borrow or steal use of someone phone in a way that prevent that person from report compromise of the phone for at least time t the encrypt communication might have be record and thu be retrievable later but the criminal can delay and quite likely evade discovery by destroy or abandon the phone before t elapse it would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their clipper phone to someone else the honest subscriber do want to pay someone else bill and he do want to fall under suspicion thi leaf two source of clipper phone for criminal use coercion and collusion coercion first theft bear a relatively low risk but also sometime a low time until detection a few minute if a phone be steal from a car park in front of a store a couple of week if a phone be steal from someone who be away on vacation criminal commerce be likely to arise in steal clipper phone with phone come from risk-inured poor criminal and cash come from risk-averse wealthy criminal someone who be extraordinarily motivate to gain a day or two of undetected communication like a terrorist could kill a person or hold them hostage the limit time before detection that a coerce phone be useful mean that continue criminal enterprise require a continue supply of freshly coerce phone there would also be create a collusive commerce between relatively wealthy criminal and ignorant or patsy who need money and who will submit to be pay in return for subscribe to clipper phone service for someone else use criminal will learn that it be more to their advantage to coerce use of a clipper cellphone than it be to apply a non-clipper cipher to a normal cellphone they will call much le attention to themself or at least to their steal phone thi way the fact of a phone use be coerce must first be report before it can be identify a an interest phone and have it key obtain from escrow clipper also allow an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super-encryption an automate full-system surveillance mechanism quite feasible acros radio bandwidth which know family key f can validate clipper wrapper and n esn association but it can not reveal in realtime the use of super-encryption unles it know all unit key which we be be assure be only to be make available in two separate piece upon specific wiretap-like order wherea a criminal use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium would stand out a criminal use of a non-clipper cipher within a clipper medium would be very difficult to detect even ex post facto in bulk record a long a the association between criminal and specific clipper chip be fracture if you make use of thi other cipher illegal per se then you can charge the criminal with thi if you can identify the true criminal he be use someone else phone but you have no evidence to help you against whatever traditional crime he might have be plan you will not even be able to detect that unusual encrypt communication be occur until you identify specific phone and obtain their key from escrow the gangster and terrorist be thu arguably more not le secure than they be before clipper come along i therefore consider clipper harmful because it do not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against aggressive or dishonest government if other cipher be proscribe it engender new type of direct criminal threat to the honest public it provide an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminal to hide their use of some other cipher make it more difficult than ever even to gain notice that unusual communication be occur and that plan for some criminal act might be in progress if other cipher be proscribe lazy investigator and prosecutor be more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime than they be the traditional and directly harmful crime which key escrow be claim to help against if other cipher be proscribe the stage be set for witch hunt of illegal cipher use because any computer can be use a a cipher machine
