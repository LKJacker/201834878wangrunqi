from whmurray subject licensing thi thread bring up the more general question can any crypto implementation for which highly publicly scrutinize source code be not available ever be trust after ibm have invent the de and the nb have advertise for proposal but before ibm have decide to respond i argue strenuously that they should not they should keep it proprietary the biggest proponent of propose wa dr lewi branscomb dr branscomb wa the ibm chief scientist and have come to ibm from nb fortunately for all of u dr branscomb understand the answer to the above question much better than i he realize how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism because of the necessary complexity publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority in fact it ha take both of those plu more than year we have also have independence the de wa solicit by nb invent and propose by ibm and vet by nb it ha also be examine and vet by expert like adi shamir who be not subject to influence by any of these even now there be still person post on thi list who do not trust the de in spite of all the time all of the analysi and all of the public scrutiny of course it be just thi point that nist miss when it attempt to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism develop in secret on the basi of authority alone we have a long thread here about whether or not the nsa can break the de that be a silly question at some cost and in some time they can break anything the important question be at what cost and in what time the fundamental strength of the de and rsa be not nearly so important a what we know about their strength a long a we understand the cost and duration for an attacker then we can use them in a safe way at thi point we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome thi knowledge gap de and rsa be among the most significant invention of the century and the most important invention in the history of cryptography we be damn lucky to have them william hugh murray executive consultant information system security locust avenue suite new canaan connecticut whmurray at
