from koontzd david koontz subject spoofing clipper serial number secrecy in clipper chip the serial number of the clipper chip be encrypt with the system key and transmit a one part of a three part message presumably the protocol can be recover if by nothing else differential analysi postulate if you will a chip or logic sit between the clipper chip and it communication channel the purpose of thi chip be twofold transmit channel the spoof chip xor the bite encrypt serial number with a secondary key variable thi render the serial number unrecoverable with just the system key recieve channel the spoof chip xor the incoming encrypt serial number with a secondary key variable assume the serial number be necessary for local operation thi ha the net result of hide the serial number thi get more interest when the number of serial number issue become large make it difficult to distinguish between valid serial number and a spoof serial number without know the system key you could lie about the serial number but risk detection of the lie if you have the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulate the format of ymy own serial number make you wonder what be hide here seem like the secrecy be to prevent you from lie about who you be
