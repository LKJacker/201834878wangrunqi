from john kelsey subject re clipper consider harmful the clipper chip user key be form by e d e e d e e d e why be the triple-encrytion use is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch if so why use bite key not know anything about the skipjack algorithm it not really possible to gues whether thi make it harder or easier to gues why be and form a they be it would be facinating to see the skipjack algorithm to look for way of attack it that require three ciphertext block form in that odd way where do the constant value that be concatenate with the serial number to form come from are they change from chip to chip or session to session even if they publish in the ny time if skipjack be resistant to known-plaintext attack when use triple encryption then there no break in security but why allow that kind of weird format if those three value be truly-random bite then maybe it use to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on skipjack if it exist ca be easily use to derive and for a whole production run of these chip do dorothy denning read thi group if not be someone on the group forward question like these to her or martin hellman or anyone else who see more detail about the chip john kelsey
