from jru jimmy r upton subject rubick shortest path algorithm statu what be the expect run time a factor of on a use the best know algorithm for find the shortest path solution for rubick cube from a randomly choose position i have read the faq and follow the recent discussion on rubick cube but i do believe thi question ha be answer notice that i be specifically look for an algorithm that find the shortest path not just any solution it seem to me that the underlie assumption be that such a program would need to do a brute force search though position that seem an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and i want to know if someone ha significantly improve on that i have some idea of my own on how to approach thi problem but before i spend to much time develop them i want to know if someone else ha already do the work administrivium i have post thi to three group and attempt to set the followup to which seem to me to be the place to continue thi discussion i will cro post a summary when and if it become appropriate email reply gladly accept jimmy jru
