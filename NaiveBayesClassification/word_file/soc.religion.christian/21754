from rexlex subject arsenokoitai scrogg cont dr jame deyoung r scrogg robin scrogg ha build upon the discussion of hi predecessor and suggest a new twist to the word scrogg believe that arsenokoitai be a hellenistic jewish coinage perhap influence by awarenes of rabbinic terminology the term be derive from lev where the lxx juxtapose the two word arseno male and koiten bed and represent the hebrew miskab zabar lie with a male yet he believe that paul do not originate the term but borrow it from circle of hellenistic jew acquaint with rabbinic discussion it wa invent to avoid contact with the usual greek terminology if thi be true scrogg observe it explain why the word do not appear in greco-roman discussion of pederasty and why later patristic writer avoid it it wa meaningles to native-speaking greek scrogg take the second part a the active word and the first word a the object of the second part thu differ from boswell learn discussion yet scrogg understand the general mean of one who ly with a male to have a very narrow reference with the precede malokous i cor which scrogg interpret a the effeminate call-boy arsenokoitai be the active partner who keep the malako of the or who hire him on occasion to satisfy hi sexual desire hence arsenokoitai do not refer to homosexuality in general to female homosexuality or to the generic model of pederasty it certainly can not refer to the modern gay model he affirm thi be scrogg interpretation of the term in i tim also the combination of pornous fornicator arsenokoitai and andrapodistai slave dealer refer to male prostitute male who lie with them and slave dealer who procure them it again refer to that specific form of pederasty which consist of the enslave of boy a youth for sexual purpose and the use of these boy by adult male even seriou mind pagan author condemn thi form of pederasty he then use these instance of arsenokoitai in i cor and i tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in rom consequently paul must have have could only have have pederasty in mind we can not know what paul would have say about the contemporary model of mutuality in same sex relation ship in relate these term to the context and to contemporary ethical concern scrogg emphasize the point that the specific item in the list of vice in i cor have no deliberate intend mean in paul the form and function of the catalogue of vice be traditional and stereotype any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context wa usually nonexistent he conclude that paul do not care about any specific item in the list both on the basi of the mean of the term and of the literary phenomenon of a catalogue of vice scrogg argue that the scripture be irrelevant and provide no help in the heat debate today the model in today christian homosexual community be so different from the model attack by the nt that biblical judgment against homosexuality be not relevant to today debate they should no longer be use in denominational discussion about homosexuality should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination reaction to the new interpretation of arsenokoitai d wright in more recent year the position of bailey boswell and scrogg have come under closer scrutiny perhap the most critical evaluation of boswell view be that by david wright in hi thorough article wright point out several shortcoming of boswell treatment of arsenokoitai he fault boswell for fail to cite or cite inaccurately all the reference to lev and in the church father such a eusebiu the apostolic constitution clement of alexandrium tertullian and origen boswell ha not consider seriously enough the possibility that the term derife either it form or it mean from the leviticu passage thi be significant for if the term be so derive it clearly refute boswell claim that the first half of the word arseno denote not the object but the gender of the second half koitai the lxx must mean a male who sleep with a male make arseno the object wright also fault boswell claim regard linguistic feature of the term include suggest parallel though boswell claim that compound with arseno employ it objectively and those with arreno employ it a an adjective wright believe that the difference between the two be merely one of dialectical diversity no semantic import attach to the difference between the two form wright believe that in most compound in which the second half be a verb or ha a verbal force the first half denote it object and where the second part be substantival the first half denote it gender it be with boswell treatment of the early church father that wright take special issue because the former ha fail to cite all the source for example aristide apology c ad probably use arrenomanei androbaten and arsenokoitia all with the same basic mean of male homosexuality contrary to boswell discussion boswell fail to cite hippolytu refut omn haer and improperly cite eusebiu and the syriac writer bardensane the latter use syriac term that be identical to the syriac of i cor and i tim next wright show how the early church father use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthorium refer to male homosexuality with teenager the dominant form of male homosexuality among the greek sometime thi parallelism occur in the threefold list of moicheium adultery porneium fornication and paidophthorium with arsenokoitai replace paidophthori clement of alexandrium in protr cite the second table of the ten commandment a you shall not kill ou moicheusei you shall not commit adultery ou paidophthoresei you shall not practice homosexuality with boy you shall not steal n another occurrence of arsenokoitein commit homosexuality exist in the sibylline oracle it may be wright observe that the word wa coin by a jewish pre-christian writer in a hellenistic set represent by book wright also discus use of arsenokoitai in rhetoriu c who draw upon the first century ad writer teucer in macariu c and in john the faster d the last in particular bear the idea of homosexual intercourse contrary to boswell wright next reply to boswell contention that the term would not be absent from so much literature about homosexuality if that be what it denote wright point out that it should not be expect in writer prior to the first century ad since it do not exist before then that the greek use dozen of word and phrase to refer to homosexuality that some source didache show no acquaintance with paul letter or deliberately avoid cite scripture and that boswell neglect cite several church father boswell treatment of chrysostom in particular draw wright attention boswell conspicuously misrepresent the witnes of chrysostom omit reference and assert what be patently untrue chrysostom gife a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in hi homily on rom boswell ha exaggerate chrysostom infrequent use of the term wright observe that boswell ha signally fail to demonstrate any u of arsenokoite etc in which it patently do not denote male homosexual activity it be infrequent because of it relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term a paidophthorium that more clearly specify the prevail form of male homosexuality in the greco-roman world wright also survey the latin syriac and coptic translation of i tim and i cor all three render arsenokoitai with word that reflect the mean homosexual they understand arseno a the object of the second half of the word none of these primary version support boswell limit conclusion base on them wright conclude hi discussion with a few observation about the catalogue of vice a a literary form he believe that such list develop in late judaism a hellenistic jew write in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the greek world thi parallel the increase concern on the part of moral philosopher over homosexual indulgence the term come into be under the influence of the lxx so that writer speak generally of male activity with male rather than specifically categorize male sexual engagement with paide if arsenokoitai and paidophthorium be interchangeable it be because the former encompass the latter in summary wright seek to show that arsenokoitai be a broad term mean homosexuality and arise with judaism the view of boswell scrogg and other who limit the term to active male prostitute or pederasty be without significant support from linguistic and historical study next the question of wright position by william peterson after that we get into the good stuff of historical linguistic study thi will include symposium by plato if there be any doubt a to the modern understand of homosexuality be understand or contemmplated at the time of paul thi will certainly clear thing up also we will review paul use of in the nt and how a for him the law wa fulfil but not do away with lev wa the universal and the follow chapter the general those who put forth that the ot no longer hold true today in my culture should stick around for thi one r scrogg the new testament and homosexuality phil independently we come to the same conclusion apparently the connection be make in sophocle greek lexicon of the roman byzantine period from to ad see discussion he say the same thing about paul language in rom but thi be doubtful see the more cautiou word of p zaa i cor wa homosexuality condoned in the corinthian church sblasp he observe that the word moixai malakous and arsenokoitai be part of jewish anti-gentile polemic yet paul wor at the end of the vice list and such be some of you indicate that paul be address real or potential bus of hi ethical message not cite primitive tradition by rote wright dispute zaa attempt to associate the term with idolatry on boswell treatment of rom the article by hay relation natural and unnatural a response to john boswell exegesi of roman jre spring be an excellent critique wright homosexual or prostitute the meaning of arsenokoitai i cor i tim vc in an unpublished paper henry mendell arsenokoitai boswell on paul effectively refutre boswell claim regard the philology of arsenokoitai he find the mean to be general a male who ha sex with a male wright endnote list additional source in the church father we also have notice the same tendency by boswell to fail to cite all the reference to sodom and sodomy in the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha see deyoung a critique of prohomosexual interpretation of the ot apocrypha and pseudepigrapha bsac in light of the claim make by boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai point to a mean lack homosexual significance wright ask pertinently why neither philo nor josephu use paidofthorium nor josephu paiderastium and why clement do not use the latter and chrysostom the former n in a more recent article homosexuality the relevance of the bible evq wright reiterate these same point paul show a remarkable originality in extend the ot ethic to the church
