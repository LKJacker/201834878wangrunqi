from caralv carol alvin subject re the arrogance of christian vbv virgilio dean b velasco jr write in article caralv carol alvin write virgilio dean b velasco jr write carol alvin write are all truth also absolute is all of scripture truth and therefore absolute the answer to both question be ye an absolute be something that be constant acros time culture situation etc true in every instance possible do you agree with thi definition ye i do agree with ymy definition example of woman cover their head and not speak hold it i say that all of scripture be true however discern exactly what jesu paul and company be try to say be not alway so easy i do believe that paul wa try to say that all woman should behave that way rather he wa try to say that under the circumstance at the time the woman he wa speak to would best avoid volubility and cover their head thi ha to do with maintain a proper witnes toward other remember that any number of relativistic statement can be derive from absolute for instance it be absolutely right for christian to strive for peace however thi do not rule out try to maintain world peace by resort to violence on occasion ye my opinion i agree that there be truth in scripture there be principle to be learn from it claiming that that truth be absolute though seem to imply a literal read of the bible if it be absolute truth constant acros time culture etc then no interpretation would be necessary it may be that the lesson glean from variou passage be different from person to person to me that do mean that one person be right and the other be wrong i believe that god transcend my simple mind and that scripture may very well have be craft with exactly thi intent god know me and know that my need be different from your or anyone else by claim that scripture be absolute then at least one person in every dispute interpretation must be wrong i just do believe that god be that rigid evangelical be clearly not take thi particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there be plenty of other example can you reconcile thi sure the bible preach absolute truth however exactly what those truth be be sometime a matter of confusion a i say the bible do preach absolute truth sometime those fundamental principle be crystal clear at least to evangelical thi be where the arrogance come in to play since these principle be crystal clear to evangelical maybe the rest of u should just take their word for it maybe it be at all crystal clear to me that their fundamental principle be either fundamental or principle i think we establish that figure out biblical truth be a matter of human interpretation and therefore error-prone yet you can still claim that some of them may be crystal clear maybe to a certain segment of christianity but to all it very difficult to see how you can claim something which be base on ymy own interpretation be absolute god reveal hi truth to the world through hi word it be utterly unavoidable however that some person whill come up with alternate interpretation practically anything can be misinterpret especially when it come to matter of right and wrong care to deny that not at all i think it support my position much more effectively than your so i think that ymy position be the bible be absolute truth but a we be prone to error in my interpretation we can not reliably determine if we have figure out what that truth be did i get that right what the point of spend all thi time claim and defend absolute truth when we can never know what those truth be and we can never or at least should act upon them what practical difference can thi make carol alvin caralv
