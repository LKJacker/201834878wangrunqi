from mdb no name subject tuff to be a christian bissda dan lawrence bissell write i do think most person understand what a christian be it be certainly not what i see a lot in church rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god sake he love u enough to die and save u so we should do the typical statement from an irrational and brainwash person the bible wa write by some male chavnist thousand of year ago a be all of the holy book follow the part that you think be suitable for modern life ignore the other for heaven sake do take it literally same hey we ca do it god himself inspire u to turn my life over to him that tuff and most person do want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but so you think it be easy to be a muslim or be a buddhist the buddha commandment be yr older than christ and in my opinion tougher to follow moreover the buddha say that we be intrinsically good a against christ we be all sinner only we allow ourself to be distract by meditate we can awaken ourself etc etc also there be no concept of god in buddhism in my opinion you can be an atheist and a buddhist but to awaken yourself be no easy task can you stay away from eat meat can you sit still and think of nothing meditate for sometime everyday buddhist do or be suppose to can you pray five time a day can you fast for a month every year ramzan are you will to give th of ymy income a tithe muslim do in fact i think jesu wa an ordinary man just a buddha and mohamed probably with a philosopy ahead of the time where he live considering the fact that christianity be a young religion compare to hindiusm judaism zorasterism buddihsm it be also very probable that the bible be merely a collection of borrow idea there wa a good deal of trade between the eastern land and the middle east at the time of christ and perhap some more but leave the crap in it out woman wa create after man to be hi helper etc ara just like weight lift or guitar play drum whatever it take time we do rush it in one day christianity be ymy whole life it be not go to church once a week or help poor person once in a while we box everything into time unit such a work at thi time sport tv social life god be above these box and should be when ever i turn on my tv there be thi pat robertson and other brain washer oh boy what an act they put on with an number to turn in ymy pledge god it seem be alive and well inside these box carry with u into all these box that we have create for ourself parting question would you have become a christian if you have not be indoctrinate by ymy parent you probably never learn about any other religion to make a comparative study and therefore i claim you be brain wash
