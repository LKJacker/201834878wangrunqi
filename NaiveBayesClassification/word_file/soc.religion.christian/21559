from mserv mail server subject re homosexual issue in christianity whitsebd bryan whitsell send in a list of verse which he felt condemn homosexuality ml michael siemon write in response that some of these verse be use against u only through incredibly perverse interpretation and that other simply do not addres the issue in response i write i can see that some of the above verse do not clearly addres the issue however a couple of them seem a though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretation in order to be see a condemn homosexuality do not be deceive neither fornicator nor idolator nor adulterer nor effeminate nor homosexual nor thieve nor the covetou nor drunkard nor reviler nor swindler shall inherit the kingdom of god and such be some of you i cor would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seem to say fornicator will not inherit the kingdom of god how do thi apply to homosexual i understand fornication to be sex outside of marriage is thi an accurate definition is there any such thing a same-sex marriage in the bible my understand ha alway be that the new testament bless sexual intercourse only between a husband and hi wife i be however will to listen to scriptural evidence to the contrary remainder of my post delete the moderator then make some comment i would like to addres there some ambiguity about the mean of the word in the passage you quote both liberal and conservative source seem to agree that homosexual be not the general term for homosexual but be likely to have a mean like homosexual prostitute that do mean that i think all the biblical evidence vanish but the nature of the evidence be such that you ca just quote one verse and solve thing if you be refer to the term effeminate and homosexual in the above passage i agree that the accuracy of the translation ha be challenge however i wa simply comment on the charge that it be an incredibly perverse interpretation to read thi a a condemnation of homosexuality such a charge seem to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that paul intend to condemn homosexuality however i think i can see how a reasonable person might very well take thi view of the verse therefore i do not believe it be incredibly perverse to read it in thi way i think ymy argument from fornication be circular why be homosexuality wrong because it fornication why be it fornication because they not marry why be they marry because the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony why do the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony because homosexuality be wrong in order to break the circle there get to be some other reason to think homosexuality be wrong clh actually i wa think of the church at all after all a couple do have to be marry by a minister a secular justice of the peace could do the job and the two person would be marry my point wa that it be easy to find a biblical basi for heterosexual marriage but where in the bible would one get a christian marriage between two person of the same sex and if you do see a biblical basi for same-sex marriage how will would gay christian be to save themself for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship please note that i be not try to imply that gay christian would not be will to be so monogamou i be genuinely interest in hear opinion on the subject i have hear comment from gay in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity a one of the main point of be homosexual yet i tend to doubt that gay who want to be christian would advocate such a position so what be the gay view mark ye i agree that a reasonable person might conclude that paul be condemn homosexuality i wa respond to certain detail of ymy post that do mean i agree with michael in all respect clh
