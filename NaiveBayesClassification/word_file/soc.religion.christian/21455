from shellgate llo larry l overacker subject re if there were no hell ofm comment the only problem with thi be that jesu do use hell a a threat he do sound like some of the more extreme fire and brimstone preacher and i do think he want person to live in abject fear but he talk a lot about person be find unworthy and mention hell a number of time i agree that it might be more pleasant to think that it do exist i certainly do agree that god be some sort of sadist who torture person forever but i be very much afraid that there really be a life and death spiritual struggle go on and that it be possible for person to lose in a seriou way clh no disagreement at all that there be a very seriou struggle go on but jesu more typically use consequence a a threat that quite different from hell classic tm jesu do sound like the usual hell-fire type of preacher he attract person through what he do and the stongest example in jesu preach be in the parable of lazaru and dife which be a parable in any case my point be that a fear-based response to christ be not a free life-affirming choice and be good news in a meaningful sense there be plenty of good reason to follow jesu that have nothing to do with fear or a literal hell that still pertain to overcome in the present struggle between god and the disloyal opposition a faith base in fear be not build on rock a we should find my faith but on ice if the fear be remove there would be no foundation that basically why it matter to me i think we have many christian that do have a solid basi for relate to the live incarnate god i can not be fully open to the work of god in and through my life if my response to god be motivate on fear larry overacker llo lawrence overacker shell oil company information center houston tx llo
