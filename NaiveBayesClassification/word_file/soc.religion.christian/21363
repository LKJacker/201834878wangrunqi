from jwindley jay windley subject mormon temple mserv mail server write one thing i do understand be why be sacred should make the temple ritual secret the so sacred it secret explanation be a bite mislead while there be a profound reverence for the temple endowment there be no injunction against discuss the ceremony itself in public but since public discussion be often irreverent most mormon would rather keep silent than have a cherish practice malign but there be certain element of the ceremony which participant explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself granted the gnostic christian have their secret ritual but these seem to have be take entirely from pagan pre-christian mystery religion there be other interpretation to christian history in thi matter one must recall that most of what we know about the gnostic wa write by their enemy eusebiu claim that jesu impart secret information to peter jame and john after hi resurrection and that those apostle transmit that information to the rest of the twelve eusebiu historium ecclesiastica ius irenaeu claim thi information wa pass on to the priest and bishop against heresy iv but eusebiu disagree he claim the secret ceremoney of the christian church perish with the apostle interestingly enough eusebiu refer to the group which we today call gnostic a promulgator of a false gnosi eusebiu op cit iius hi gripe wa not that thay profess a gnosi but that they have the wrong one writing deal with jesu post-resurrection teach emphasize secrecy not so much a concealment a a policy of not teach certain thing indiscriminately in one story simon magu open a dialog with peter on the nature of god peter response be you seem to me not to know what a father and a god be but i could tell you both whence soul be and when and how they be make but it be not permit to me now to disclose these thing to you clementine recognition ius if any one theme underly the recognition it be the idea that certain doctrine be not to be idly teach but can be have after a certain level of spiritual maturity be reach now one can approach thi and other such evidence in many way i do intend that everyone interpret christian history a i do but i believe that evidence exist favorably interpret of course of early christian rite analogou to those practice by mormon today neither new testament christianity nor biblical judaism make a secret of their practice but if judaism and christianity have such ceremoney would you expect to read about them in public document one can search the book of mormon and other mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship ye you could establish that mormon worship in temple but you would probably be hard press to characterize that worship on that basi can we conclude that the bible explain all practice which might have take place and that absence of such description prove they do not exist mormon scholar dr hugh nibley offer u a list of scripture from which i have take a few it be give unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven but to them it be not give matt all man can not receive thi say save they to whom it be give matt i have yet many thing to say unto you but ye can not bear them now john the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverb but i shall shew you plainly of the father john unspeakable word which it be not lawful for a man to utter cor many thing i would not write with paper and ink but i come unto you and speak face to face jn nibley since cumorah pp again these can also be interpret many different way i believe they serve to show that not all doctrine which could have be teach be actually teach openly i have hear that joseph smith take the entire practice both the ritual and the secrecy surround the ritual from the freemason anybody in the know have any authoritative information on whether or not thi claim be true historically joseph smith have be adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before join the freemason there be diary evidence which support a claim that the rite do not change after smith become a mason it can be argue that smith have ample exposure to masonic proceed through the burlesque of hi time and through hi brother hyrum a mason though no specific connection ha yet be establish my conversation with mason with respect to temple rite transcription which have appear on the net have lead me to believe that the connection from masonry to mormonism be fairly tenuou a my moderator note most of what wa similar wa remove in the recent revision to the temple ceremony i believe that critic who charge that mormon rite be lift from freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rite in question jay windley university of utah salt lake city jwindley
