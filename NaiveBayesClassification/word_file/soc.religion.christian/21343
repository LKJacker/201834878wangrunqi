from nabil nabil ayoub subject re monophysite and mike walker hello src reader again the misconception that copt among other oriental orthodox church believe in monophysitism pop up again we have a discussion about it a while ago in article d andrew byler write the proper term for what mike express be monophysitism thi wa a heresy that wa condemn in the council of chalcedon in ad it grow up in reaction to nestorianism which hold that the son and jesu be two different person who happen to be unite in the same body temporarily monophysitism be hold by the copt of egypt and ethipoium and by the jacobite of syrium and the armenian orthodox then ofm comment these issue get mighty subtle when you see person say different thing it often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different thing or whether they be use different terminology i do think there any question that there be a problem with nestoriu and i would agree that the say christ have a human form without a real human nature or will be heretical but i like to be a bite wary about the copt armenian etc recent discussion suggest that their monophysite position may not be a far from orthodoxy a many have think with my appreciation to the moderator i believe that further elaboration be need thi be an excerpt from an article feature in the first issue of the copt-net newsletter under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople a oppose to the western empire of rome the patriarch and pope of alexandrium play lead role in christian theology they be invite everywhere to speak about the christian faith st cyril pope of alexandrium wa the head of the ecumenical council which wa hold in ephesu in the year it wa say that the bishop of the church of alexandrium do nothing but spend all their time in meet thi lead role however do not fare well when politic start to intermingle with church affair it all start when the emperor marcianu interfere with matter of faith in the church the response of st dioscoru the pope of alexandrium who wa later exile to thi interference wa clear you have nothing to do with the church these political motive become even more apparent in chalcedon in when the coptic church wa unfairly accuse of follow the teach of eutych who believe in monophysitism thi doctrine maintain that the lord jesu christ ha only one nature the divine not two nature the human a well a the divine the coptic church ha never believe in monophysitism the way it wa portray in the council of chalcedon in that council monophysitism mean believe in one nature copt believe that the lord be perfect in hi divinity and he be perfect in hi humanity but hi divinity and hi humanity be unite in one nature call the nature of the incarnate word which wa reiterate by st cyril of alexandrium copt thu believe in two nature human and divine that be unite in one without mingle without confusion and without alteration from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy these two nature do not separate for a moment or the twinkle of an eye also from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy the coptic church wa misunderstand in the century at the council of chalcedon perhap the council understand the church correctly but they want to exile the church to isolate it and to abolish the egyptian independent pope despite all of thi the coptic church ha remain very strict and steadfast in it faith whether it wa a conspiracy from the western church to exile the coptic church a a punishment for it refusal to be politically influence or whether pope dioscuru do quite go the extra mile to make the point that copt be not monophysite the coptic church ha alway felt a mandate to reconcile semantic difference between all christian church thi be aptly express by the current successor of st mark pope shenouda iius to the coptic church faith be more important than anything and other must know that semantic and terminology be of little importance to u throughout thi century the coptic church ha play an important role in the ecumenical movement the coptic church be one of the founder of the world council of church it ha remain a member of that council since the coptic church be a member of the all african council of church aacc and the middle east council of church mecc the church play an important role in the christian movement by conduct dialogue aim at resolve the theological difference with the catholic greek orthodox presbyterian and evangelical church a a final note the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox do sign a common statement of christology in which the heresey of monophysitism wa condemn so the coptic orthodox church do not believe in monophysitism peace nabil nabil ayoub engine research center dept of mechanical engineering university of wisconsin-madison email ayoub a i mention in a brief apology the comment quote above from me be confuse i appear to say that nestoriu wa monophysite a andrew byler correctly state it the nestorian and monophysite be actually opposite party the point i wa make which nabil explain in some detail be that some group that have be consider heretical probably be chalcedon wa a compromise between two group the alexandrian and antiochene it adopt language that wa intend to be acceptable to moderate in both camp while rule out the extreme i agree that there be extreme that be heretical however in the course of the complex politic of the time it appear that some person get reject who do intend heresy but simply use language that wa not understand or even wa mispresented and some seem not to have joint in the compromise for reason other than doctrine there be group descend from both of the supposedly heretical camp thi post discuss the descendant of the alexandrian there be also a remain nestorian like some of the current so-called monophysite there be reason to believe that the current so-called nestorian be not heretical either they shelter nestoriu from what they saw a unfair treatment but claim they do not adopt hi heresy and in fact seem to follow more moderate representative of the antiochene tradition clh
