from gene gros subject re did he really rise in article oser scott oser write and the two simplest refutation be these what impact the only record of impact come from the new testament i have no guarantee that it book be in the least accurate and that the record impact actually happen i find it interest that no other contemporary source record an eclipse an earthquake a temple curtain be tear etc the earliest write claim we have of jesu resurrection be from the pauline epistle none of which be write sooner than year after the suppose event first off i say that the impact if right before ymy eye that we be even discuss thi be a major impact in and of itself further the early church bear testimony to the impact it seem probable that no one display the body of jesu because no one know where it wa i personally believe that the most likely explanation wa that the body wa steal by disciple or by graverobber do bother with the point about the guard it only appear in one gospel and seem like exactly the sort of thing early christian might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge the new testament do record that jew believe the body have be steal if there be really guard they could not have effectively make thi claim a they do of course they know where it wa do forget that jesu wa see by both the jew and the roman a a troublemaker pilate wa no fool and do need the additional headach of some fisherman steal jesu body to make it appear he have arise since jesu wa bury in the grave of a man well know to the sanhedrin to say that they do know where he wa bury beg the question now you say that you think that the disciple steal the body but think on thi a moment would you die to maintain something you knew to be a deliberate lie if not then why do you think the disciple would now i not talk about die for something you firmly believe to be the truth but unbeknown to you it be a lie many have do thi no i talk about die by behead stone crucifixion etc for something you know to be a lie thu you position with regard to the disciple steal the body seem rather lightweight to me a for graverobber why risk the severe penalty for grave rob over the body of jesu he wa bury with great rich so again thi be an argument that can be discount that leaf you back on square one what happen to the body ihl gene the opinion express be not necessarily those of the university of north carolina at chapel hill the campu office for information technology or the experimental bulletin board service internet or again let me comment that the most plausible non-christian scenario and the one typically suggest by sceptic who be knowledgeable about the nt be that the resurrection wa a subjective event and the empty tomb story be a result of account grow in the tell clh
