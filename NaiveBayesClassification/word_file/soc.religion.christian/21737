from mikec mike christensen subject re homosexual issue in christianity ml michael siemon write in article mserv someone name mark write do not be deceive neither fornicator nor idolator nor adulterer nor effeminate nor homosexual nor thieve nor the covetou nor drunkard nor reviler nor swindler shall inherit the kingdom of god and such be some of you i cor the moderator adequately discus the circularity of ymy use of porneium in thi i think we can all agree with paul that there be some kind of activity that could be name by fornication or theft or covet or revile or drunkennes which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bind of those category however and the very fact that they be argue over suggest that not only be the matter not at all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician have no interest in making them clear leave matter rather to my spirit-led decision with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that ha dominate christian discussion of all these area what be fornication sex outside of marriage abuse of sex is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage is it an unatural use of what god ha give u why be it that homosexual be use the grace of god a a license to practice sin for certain person have creep in unnoticed those who be long beforehand mark out for thi condemnation ungodly person who turn the grace of my god into licentiousnes and deny my only master and lord jesu christ jude nasb what be define by god a a legitimate marriage for thi cause a man shall leave hi father and hi mother and shall cleave to hi wife and the shall become one flesh gen nasb and he answer and say have you not read that he who create them from the begin made them male and female and say thi cause a man shall leave hi father and mother and cleave to hi wife and the two shall become one flesh consequently they be no longer two but one flesh what therefore god ha join together let no man separate matt nasb but because of immorality let each man have hi own wife and let each woman have her own husband let the husband fulfill hi duty to hi wife and likewise also the wife to her husband corinthian nasb there be plenty of law prohibit sexual behavior to be find in leviticu most of which christian ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just assume that they know which one be moral and which one be ritual well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean v unlcean a category in an awful lot of society we have them too but bury pretty deep and i can not see any grind for distinguish these bite of leviticu from the ritual law which no christian i know feel apply to u i disagree every law that be write in leviticu should be look at a sin that be why we have a need for a savior i can understand someone who may not know a particular sin list in the levitcal law but i would hope that they would repent when confront with it i notice that the verse forbid bestiality immediately follow the verse prohibit what appear to be homosexual intercourse well la-ti-da so what thi be almost a slimey an argument a the one that homosexuality rape i know of no one who argue seriously though one can alway find joker in defense of bestiality it be absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issue gay christian do raise which concern sexual activity within commit consensual human adult realtionship so that ymy bring it up be no more relevant than the law of kashrut if you can not addres the actual issue you be be bloody dishonest in trail thi red herring in front of the world if you want to addres bestiality that be ymy busines not mine and attempt to torpedo a seriou issue by use what be in my culture a ridiculou joke show that you have no interest in hear u a human be you want to dismis u and use the sleaziest mean you can think of to do so also i notice that the preceeding verse say also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakednes during her menstrual impurity and you shall not have intercourse with ymy neighbor wife to be defile with her leviticu nasb these verse be just a relevant a you shall not lie with a male a one ly with a female it be an abomination leviticu nasb why wa god tell the israelite not to practice such thing do not defile yourself by any of these thing for by all these the nation which i be cast out before you have become defile for the land ha become defile therefore i have visit it punishment upon it so the land ha spew out it inhabitant but a for you you be to keep my statute and judgment and shall not do any of these abomination neither the native nor the alien who sojourn among you leviticu nasb he be the lord listen to what he ha to say nobody want to dismis homosexual we do love you but we do agree that what you practice be not sin you have not truly repent of ymy sin we hate the sin that be within ymy life i hate sin that be in my life all christian should hate the sin that be within their own life confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance ye i agree with john but i also know that jesu say repent for the kingdom of heaven be at hand matt if you do agree that homosexuality be sin than how can you repent from it thi mean that you remain in bondage to it repent from it and god will set you free in hi love mike michael christensen trust the lord
