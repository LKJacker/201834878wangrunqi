from hudson paul hudson jr subject re dream and out of body incident in article c david e goggin write i like to get ymy comment on a question that ha be on my mind a lot what apply to dream and out-of-body incident in normal dream you ca control anything so obviously you be morally responsible for ymy action but if you can contrive to control the action in dream or do an oobe it seem like a morality apply i think that if someone often ha immoral dream like lustful dream or dream where you commit act of violence etc etc it may be a sign that he ha something sinful in hi heart it may be the holy spirit way of allow the sinfulnes that be in u to come to light so that we can pray about it and have it remove generally if one ha a pure heart and set hi mind on thing that be holy he will be holy even when he dream dream also can be from the lord joseph and nebucadnezzar be two example of person in the bible who receive dream from the lord regarding out of body experience thi be something that we have to be careful with what be call an oobe can be spiritual in nature especially if what one saw be the same a an experience witness by someone else christian should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate an out of body experience some thing that might be call an oobe might actually be from the lord paul write of what might of be an oobe in ius corinthian he write of a spiritual experience of be catch up into the third heaven is an oobe truely an oobe do one really leave hi body or be he just see an image be show to him by a spirit be it a demon or the holy spirit i do think it matter that much paul could not tell be that a it may we should be careful not to open ourself up to satan to experience oobe we should not meditate and pretend we be in a place until my spirit apparently float there thi be dangerou if god want to gice u what seem like an oobe then he can do that of hi own sovereign will in the bible most often it seem that prophet be just take up by god sovereign will and not because they be seek an oobe john wa in the spirit pray on the lord day when he wa catch up in the vision he receive ezekial wa talk with some jewish leader when he wa catch up into the vision of god one time if god want to take one of u up into a vision he can do it person should be careful not to open themself up to evil spirit for the sake of a few thrill link hudson
