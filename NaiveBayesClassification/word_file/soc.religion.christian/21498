from geno subject re atheist and hell imagine the worst depth of despair you ever encounter or the worst physical pain you ever experience some person suffer such emotional physical and mental anguish in their life that their death seem to be merciful but at least the pain do end in death what if you live a hundred such life at the conclusion of one you be instantly reborn into another what if you live a million a billion year in thi state what if thi keep go forever did thi happen to jesu i do think so not from what i hear he live one day of suffer and die if the wage of sin be the above paragraph then jesu did pay for my sin did he thi be something i alway find a little curiou i never quite understand the trinity thing on the one hand jesu be suppose to be god incarnate but at the same time he be god son for god so love the world that he give hi only beget son first question be if jesu wa god in human form how could he really be god son if the holy ghost plant the seed in mary so to speak then it seem that jesu relationship to god would be the equivalent to the human relationship while a son might inherit alot of the father quality he be not the father they be still two separite entity to try and say that a son be the same person a the father be obviously wrong in that case jesu and god be the same on the other hand if their relationship be the same a the human relationship but jesu be actually god incarnate then he not really god son and he never wa he just god manifest himself a jesu at least thi be how i see it can someone who be more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten u getting back to the original question what be the great price that jesu pay to redeem my sin wa it die on the cro since jesu know that he would rise again in day and then ascend back to heaven i have a hard time see how thi be consider pay such a great price for humanity hi earthly body may have be kill but then so what he suffer a few hour of physical pain but then there ha be many a human who ha suffer a great deal more the fact that jesu wa god only beget son do seem to me to have much mean since god can beget a many son a he want to jesu be the only one wa simply a matter of choice i suspect that these question will be very offensive to many christian on thi net to those person please accept my sincere apology it be not my intention to offend or to trivialize christ but i do believe these be legitimate question and i be genuinely curiou note that the trinity and incarnation have to be look at together first ymy read of the virgin birth be an uncommon one in thi group it dangerou to say that no one believe something you seem to be suggest the jesu be god son in a physical sense with the holy spirit a father and mary a mother i consider that terrible heresy though some person react le violently the virgin birth say that jesu birth be god responsibility but it do imply that god sperm wa involve indeed one though by no mean the only speculation be that god use joseph genetic material second jesu be in some sense doubly indirect from the father in a trinitarian context the term son refer to the eternal logo who be a part of god the son do come into existence with jesu birth jesu be the incarnation of the son so hi sonnes be specifically a result of be incarnate rather it the son who wa incarnate clh
