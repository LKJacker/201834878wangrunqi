from rexlex subject arsenokoitai continue part i think use by permission the source and nt meaning of arsenokoitai with implication for christian ethic and ministry jame b deyoung w petersen more recently wright understand ha itself be question from a different direction in a brief study william petersen find linguistic confusion in use the english word homosexual a the mean of arsenokoitai he fault wright and english bible translaion for render it by homosexual in i cor and i tim in a sense petersen ha coalesce bailey boswell and scrogg into a single assertion that reiterate in effect the position of bailey he find homosexual unacceptable a a translation because it be anachronistic a major disjunction exist between contemporary think and terminology and the think and terminolgy in paul time what be thi disjunction he basis it on historical and linguistic fact accordingly ancient greek and roman society treat male sexuality a polyvalent and characterize a person sexually only by hi sexual act virtually all form of behavior except transvestism be acceptable christianity simply add the category of natural and unnatural in describe these action ancient society know nothing of the category of homosexual and heterosexual and assume that in the word of dover quote approvingly by petersen everyone respond at different time to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimulus in contrast to thi modern usage virtually limit the term homosexual to desire and propensity benkert who in coin the german term equivalent to homosexual use it a refer to orientation impluse or affectional preference and have nothing to do with sexual act petersen then proceed to cite the supplement to the oxford english dictionary which define homosexual only a a propensity or desire with no mention of act petersen point be that by use homosexual for arsenokoitai one wrongfully read a modern concept back into early history where no equivalent concept exist consequently the translation be inaccurate because it include celibate homophile incorrectly exlude heterosexual who engage in homosexual act and incorrectly include female homosexual prior to there wa no cognitive structure either inmy society or in antiquity within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into and make sence the forego clarify why petersen feel that the translatio homosexual be mistake yet be it possible that petersen be the one mistake on both historical and linguistic or philological grind the next phase of thi paper will critically examine petersen position the justification for translating arsenokoitai by homosexual historical ground a refutation of the forego opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by homosexual begin with the historical and cultural evidence since virtually everyone acknowledge that the word do not appear before paul usage no historical set earlier than hi be available yet much write reveal that ancient understand of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with paul the goal be to discover wheither the ancient s conceive of homosexuality particularly homosexual orientation in a way similar to present-day concept peterson bailey boswell and scrogg claim that the homosexual condition desire propensity or inversion whatever it be call can not be part of the definition of the term they assert thi either because the term be limit to act of particular kind boswell active male prostitute scrogg pederasty or because the homosexual condition wa unknown in ancient time bailey petersen the follow discussion will show why neither of these position be legitimate attention will be devote to the latter postion first with the former one be address below under linguistic ground in regard to the latter position one may rightfully ask do not the homosexual condition exist before is it only a modern phenomenon yet if it be universal a allege today it must have exist alway include ancient time even though there be lack of sophistication in discuss it indeed evidence show that the ancient pre-christian and christian not only know about the total spectrum of sexual behavior include all form of same-sex activity transvestism include but also knoew about same-sex orientation or condition petersen admit n that plato in symposium may be a sole possible exception to ancient ingnorance of thi condition he discount thi however believe that even here act appear to be the decide factor however thi be a very significant exception hardly worthy of be call an exception because of the follow additional evidence for a homosexual condition the symposium of plato gife some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition plato posit a third sex comprise of a maile-female androgynon man-woman hence original nature palai physi consist of three kind of human be zeu slice these human be in half to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the god consequently each person seek hi or her other half either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex plato then quote aristophance each of u then be but a tally of a man since every one show like a flatfish the trace of have be slice in two and each be ever search for the tally that will fit him all the man who be section of that composite sex that at first wa call man-woman be woman-courter my adulterer be mostly descend from that sex whence likewise be derive my mancourting woman and adulteress all the woman who be section of the woman have no great fancy for man they be incllined rather to woman and of thi stock be the she-minion man who be section of the male pursue the masculine and so long a their boyhood last they show themself to be slice of the male by make griend with man and delight to lie with them and to be clasp in man embrasce these be the finest boy and stripling for they have the most manly nature some say they be shameles creature but falsely for their behavior be due not to shamelessnes but to dare manlines and virility since they be quick to welcome their like sure evidence of thi be the fact that on reach maturity these alone prove in a public career to be man so when they come to man estate they be boy-lover and have no natural interest in wive and get child but only do these thing under stres of custom they be quite content to live together unwedded all their day a man of thi sort be at any rate bear to be a lover of boy or the will mate of a man eagerly greet hi own kind well when one of them whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort happen on hi own particular half the two of them be wondrously thrill with affection and intimacy and love and be hardly to be induce to leave each other side for a single moment these be they who continue together throughout life though they could not even say what they would have of one another should these two person be offer the opportunity to be fuse together for a long a they live or even in hade aristophane say that each would unreservedly deem that he have be offer just what he wa yearn for all the time several observation about thi text be in order lesbianism be contemplate a will a male homosexuality natural interest ton noun physei refelect modern concept of propensity or inclination the word bear to be a lover of boy or the will mate of a man paideraste te kai phileraste gignetai reflect the modern claim to be bear thi a homosexual the

emphyto allelon toi anthropoi kai te archaia physeo synagogeu the concept of permanency these be they who continue together throughout life be also present further mention of allusion to permanecy mutality gay pride pederasty homophobium motive desire passion and the nature of love and it work be recognizable clearly the ancient think of love homosexual or other apart from action the speaker in the symposium argue that motive in homosexuality be crucial money office influence etc bring reproach they mention the need to love the soul not the body there be tow kind of love in the body and each ha it desire and passion the speaker discus the principle or matter of love the desire of love and be male by nature noteworthy be the speech of socrate who devote much attention to explain how desire be relate to love and it object desire be felt for what be not provide or present for something they have not or be not or lack thi be the object of desire and love socrate clearly distinguish between what sort of be be love and the work of love thi ancient philosopher could think of both realm seaual act a well a disposition of be or nature hi wor have significance for more than pederasty in summary virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality be anticipate in the symposium of plato petersen be in error when he claim that the ancient could only think of homosexual act not inclination or orientation widespread evidence to the contray support the latter biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the context where homosexual act be discribed add to the case for the ancient distinction in rom such phrase a reason heart become foolish desire of the heart and reprobate mind prove paul concern for disposition and inclination along with the do or

create of the new label of natural and unnatural for sexual behavior these do not begin with paul rom but go a far back a ancient greece and even non-christian contemporary use them plato the philo josephu plutarch and other use these word or relate concept linguistic ground footnote petersen can arsenokoitai be translated by i cor i tim vc dover greek homosexuality cambridge harvard univ n we

homosexuality and other evidence cite below the translation be that of lamb plato symposioum lcl cambridge harvard univ note the reference to adulteres if there be a homosexual condition derive from birth or the gene logically there must also be an adulterou conditon derive from birth elsewhere in the symposium we be tell that it be the heavenly love to love the male and young man but thi must not be love for boy too young the latter should be outlaw such love of youth be to be permanent lifelong and abide where homosexual love be consider a disgrace such an attitude be due to encroachment of the ruler and to the cowardice of the rule an early charge of homophobium in athen it wa more honorable to love openly than in secret an ancient expression of come out of the closet mutality wa
