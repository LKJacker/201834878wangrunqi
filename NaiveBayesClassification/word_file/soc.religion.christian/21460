from mmh matthew huntbach subject re when be two person marry in god e in article randal lee nichola mandock write i be not against capital punishment i feel thi way because god be not only a god of love but a god of justice a we christian be the instrument of hi will here on earth we be expect to be true to the mandate give u by the lord to judge the action of my fellow man my favorite scriptural reference in thi regard be roman let every person be subordinate to the higher authority for there be no authority except from god and those that exist have be establish by god therefore whoever resist authority oppose what god ha appoint and those who oppose it will bring judgment upon themself my view reflect the teach of the roman catholic church i would say only to the extent that the roman catholic church neither approve nor disapprove of capital punishment a confirm in the recent catechism though there be many rc who be rather surprise and upset that capital punishment wa not explicitly condemn for myself a a catholic i see my own opposition to capital punishment a much the same a my opposition to abortion a reverence for life here in the uk the anti-abortion case be often let down by the explicit link which those on the political leave make with anti-abortionist and pro-executionist there be a tendency to condemn person who hold both view a hypocrite i feel that if there be many more anti-abortionist who be also vocal in their opposition to capital punishment on a pro-life line it would end thi kneejerk association of anti-abortion a a right-wing thing and get many to think seriously about the issue there be plenty who be pro-abortion equally for a kneejerk left-wing reason i do not think ymy biblical quote can automatically be take a support for capital punishment i take it that a a roman catholic you be oppose to abortion and would still onsider it wrong and something to be object to even if legalise by authority matthew huntbach
