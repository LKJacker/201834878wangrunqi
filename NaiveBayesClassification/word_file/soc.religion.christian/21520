from michael d walker subject re the doctrine of original sin geno write joseph h buehler write thi all obviously apply equally well to infant or adult since both have soul infant must be baptize therefore or they can not enter into heaven they too need thi form of life in them or they can not enter into heaven are you say that baptism ha nothing to do with ask jesu to come into ymy heart and accept him a ymy savior but be just a ritual that we must go through to enable u to enter heaven my feel on baptism be thi parent baptize their baby so that the baby ha the sanctify grace of baptism and thu removal of original sin on it soul in the event of an unexpected death that be the parent speak on behalf of the child which be too young to speak on it own thi should not surprise anyone do parent alway do what they believe be the best for their baby why would that apply to the baby physical need only but not spiritual need to have god grace the purpose of confirmation be for the baby now young adult to decide to re-affirm for the promise that parent make at baptism that be where accept jesu into ymy heart come in in baptism the parent ask jesu to come into their baby heart at confirmation the child repeat that request independently by the way these be my personal feel though i believe they be pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the catholic church on thi issue can anyone out there back me up or correct me
