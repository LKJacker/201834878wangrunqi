from jbuddenberg jimmy buddenberg subject revelation babylon hello all we be do a bible study at my college on revelation we have be do pretty good a far a get some sort of reasonable interpretation we be now on chapter and which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of babylon i believe the beast be the antichrist some may differ but it seem obviou and the woman represent babylon which stand for rome or the roman catholic church what be some view on thi interpretation is the fall babylon in chapter the same babylon in a in chapter the catholic church hate to step on to thank jimmy buddenberg internet jbuddenberg muskingum college reading thi imagery a the roman catholic church wa certainly common in earlier protestant writer a lot of u find that frankly embarassing now though some of my reader will certainly advocate such a position the problem be that the description make it look a lot like a political entity it associate with king control world commerce be seat on seven mountain recall that rome be traditionally regard a build on seven hill if it a church then it not the current roman catholic church but a church that ha be take over by the anti-christ and merge with the state turn into something rather different than it be now presumably in such a scenario the true catholic be among those who be persecute given the overall impression that satan be pretend to be an angel of light and the true church be a persecute remnant i think the most consistent play out of the image would be that the anti-christ would be preside over a church that claim to be the heir of both the protestant and catholic tradition but that the true spiritual descendant of both peter and the reformer be equally be persecute clh
