from hedrick subject faq essay on homosexuality someone refer to my faq essay on homosexuality since it ha be post for some time and i modify it somewhat since the last time i take thi opportunity to post it there be another entry in the faq contain comment by some other contributor they can be retrieve from a it contain far more detail on the exegetical issue than i give here though primarily from a conservative point of view thi post summarize several issue involve homosexuality and christian thi be a frequently ask question so i do not post the question each time it occur rather thi be an attempt to summarize the post we get when we have a discussion it summarize argument for allow christian homosexuality since most person ask the question already know the argument against it the most common but not the only question deal with herein be how can a christian justify be a homosexual give what the bible say about it first on the definition of many group believe that there be a homosexual orientation a sexual attraction to member of the same sex thi be distinguish from actual homosexual sexual activity homosexual who abstain from sex be consider by most group to be acceptable however in a lot of discussion the term mean someone actually engage in homosexual sex thi be generally not accept outside the most group in thi paper i go to use a mean a person engage in sexual act with another of the same sex i have hear of any biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who remain celebate i think most person now admit that there be a predisposition to be homosexual thi be often call a orientation it be not know whether it be genetic or environmental there be evidence suggest each the best evidence i see be that homosexuality be not a single phenomenon but ha a number of different cause one of them be probably genetic there be several group that try to help person move from be homosexual to heterosexual the best-known be exodu international the report i see and i have read the detail literature just the summary in the minority opinion to the presbyterian church infamou report on human sexuality suggest that these program have very low succes rate and that there be question about how real even the success be but there certainly be person who say they have convert however thi issue be not a important a it sound those who believe homosexuality be wrong believe it be intrinsically wrong define a such by god the fact that it hard to get out of be a homosexual be no more relevant than the fact that it hard to escape from be a drug addict if it wrong it wrong it may affect how we deal with person though if it very difficult to change thi may tend to make u more will to forgive it one more general background issue it common to quote a figure that of the population be homosexual i ask one of my expert where thi come from here hi response kinsey see below be the source of the figure percent he define sexuality by behavior not by orientation and rank all person on a scale from zero completely heterosexual to completely heterosexual according to kinsey one-third of all male adult have have at least one experience of orgasm homosexually post puberty ten percent of all adult male have most of their experience of homosexually that wa in the percentage hold true in a followup study do by the kinsey institute base on datum in the early seventy but not publish until the early or so by bell and weinberg i believe i ca put my hand on thi latter reference but here be the online information for kinsey own study a it appear in iri the catalog at rutger author kinsey alfred charle title sexual behavior in the human male by alfred c kinsey wardell b pomeroy and clyde e martin publisher philadelphium w b saunder co descrip xv p diagr cm note based on survey make by member of the staff of indiana university and support by the national research council committee for research on problem of sex by mean of fund contribute by the medical division of the rockefeller foundation bibliography p other aut pomeroy wardell baxter joint author martin clyde eugene joint author subject sex u s moral condition lc card thi figure be widely use in all scholarly discussion and ha even be find to hold true in several other culture a note in the recent newsweek coverstory is thi child gay feb a journalist be run the round of talk show thi season promote her book that allegedly refute kinsey study but the scholarly world seem to take her for a kook i see some objection to the kinsey study but not in enough detail to include here if someone would like to contribute another view i be will to include it most christian believe homosexuality at least genital sex be wrong not all however a few denomination accept it the metropolitan community church be the best-known it wa form specifically to accept homosexual however the united church of christ also allow it and i think a couple of other group may a well the episcopal church seem to accept it some area but not other in church that have congregational government you find a few congregation that accept it even among southern baptist though the number be probably only one or two congregation but these be unusual few church permit homosexual church leader how carefully they enforce thi be another issue i do have any doubt that there be homosexual pastor of just about every denomination some more open than other a to the argument over the biblical and other issue here an attempt to summarize the issue the most commonly cite reference by those favor acceptance of homosexuality in previou discussion ha be john boswell christianity social tolerance and homosexuality u chicago pres the argument against be pretty clear there be several explicit law in the ot leviticu and in rom paul seem pretty negative on homosexuality beyond these reference there be some debate some passage often cite on the subject probably be not relevant the sin which the inhabitant of sodom propose to carry out wa homosexual rape not homosexual activity between consent adult there even some question whether it wa homosexual since the entity involve be angel it wa particularly horrify because it involve guest and the responsibility toward guest in that culture wa very strong thi be probably the reason lot offer hi daughter it wa better to give up hi daughter than to allow hi guest to be attack if you look through a concordance for reference to sodom elsewhere in the bible you see that few seem to imply that homosexuality wa their sin there a jewish interpretive tradition that the major sin wa abuse of guest at any rate there no debate that homosexual rape be wrong i do not discus leviticu because the law there be part of a set of law that most christian do not consider bind so unles nt justification can be find lev alone would not settle the issue the nt reference be all in paul letter a number of the reference from paul be list of sin in which the word be fairly vague boswell argue that the word occur in these list do not mean homosexual here what he say the two greek word that appear in the list i cor and i tim be malako and arsenokoitai unfortunately it be not entirely clear what the word actually mean malako with a basic mean of soft ha a variety of metaphorical mean in ethical write boswell suggest wanton a a likely equivalent he also report that the unanimou interpretation of the church include greek-speaking christian wa that in thi passage it refer to masturbation a mean that ha vanish only in the cent a that practice ha come to be le frowned-upon he cite reference a late a the edition of the catholic encyclopedium that identify it a masturbation he translate arsenokotai a male prostitute give evidence that none of the church father understand the term a refer to homosexuality in general a more technical mean suggest by the early latin translation would be active mode homosexual male prostitute but in hi view paul do not intend it so technically for a more conservative view i consult gordon fee commentary on i cor he cite evidence that malako often mean effeminate however boswell warn u that in greek culture effeminate be not necessarily synonymou with homosexual though it may be associate with some kind of homosexual behavior given what boswell and fee say take together i suspect that the term be simply not very definite and that while it apply to homosexual in some case it be a general term for homosexuality while fee argue against boswell with arsenokotai a well he end up suggest a translation that seem essentially the same the big problem with it be that the word be almost never use paul write be the first occurence the fact that the word be clearly compose of male and unfortunately do quite tell u the mean since it do tell u whether the male be the subject or object of the action example of compound word form either way can be give in theory it could refer to rapist etc it dangerou to base mean purely on etymology or you conclude that goodbye be a religiou expression because it base on god by with ye however since boswell fee and niv seem to agree on homosexual male prostitute that seem a good a gues a any note that thi translation miss the strong vulgarity of the term however something which fee and boswell agree on but do not attempt to reproduce in their translation in my opinion the strongest nt reference to homosexuality be roman boswell point out that rom speak of homosexuality a something that happen to person who be naturally heterosexual a a result of their corruption due to worship false god one could argue that thi be simply an example that if a homosexual worship false god he would also fall into degradation and perhap become heterosexual however i find thi argument somewhat force and in fact my homosexual reader have not seriously propose that thi be what paul mean however i be not convince that rom be sufficient to create a law against homosexuality for christian what paul be describe in rom be not homosexuality among christian it homosexuality that appear among idolater a one part of a whole package of wickednes despite the impression leave by hi impassioned rhetoric i sure paul do not believe that pagan completely abandon heterosexual sex given hi description of their situation i rather assume that their heterosexual sex would also be debase and shameles so ye i do believe that thi passage indicate a negative view of homosexuality but in all fairnes the shameles nature of their act be a reflection of the general spiritual state of the person and not a specific feature of homosexuality my overall view of the situation be the follow i think we have enough evidence to be confident that paul disapprove of homosexuality rom seem clear while i cor and i tim be not unambiguou and general condemnation of homosexuality they do not seem like word that would come from someone who approve of homosexuality or even consider it acceptable in some case on the other hand none of these passage contain explicit teach on the subject rom be really about idolatry it refer to homosexuality in pass the result of thi situation be that person interpret these passage in light of their general approach to scripture for those who look to scripture for law about issue such a thi it not surprise that they would consider these passage to be nt endorsement of the ot prohibition for those whose approach to the bible be more liberal it be not surprise that they regard paul negative view of homosexuality a something that he take from hi jewish upbringing without any seriou reexamination in the light of the gospel a reader of thi group know by now the assumption behind these approach be so radically different that person tend to foam at the mouth when they see the oppose view describe there not a lot i can do a moderator about such a situation a number of discussion in the past center around the sort of detail exegesi of text that be describe above however in fact i not convince that defender of homosexuality actually base their own belief on such analysis the real issue seem to rest on the question of whether paul judgement should apply to modern homosexuality one commonly make claim be that paul have simply never face the kind of question we be try to deal with he encounter homosexuality only in context where most person would probably agree that it wa wrong he have never face the experience of christian who try to act straight and fail and he have never face christian who be try to define a christian homosexuality which fit with general christian ideal of fidelity and of see sexuality a a mirror of the relationship between god and man it be unfair to take paul judgement on homosexuality among idolater and use it to make judgement on these question another be the follow in paul time homosexuality wa associate with a number of thing that christian would not find acceptable it wa part of temple prostitution among private citizen it often occur between adult and child or free person and slave i not in a position to say that it alway do but there be some reason to think so the ancient distinguish between the active and passive partner it wa consider disgraceful for a free adult to act a the passive partner thi be the reason that an active mode homosexual prostitute would be consider disgraceful hi customer would all be person who enjoy the passive role thi support the idea that it would tend not to be engage in between two free adult male at least not without some degree of scandal clearly christian homosexual would not condone sex with child slave or other who be not in a position to be fully responsible partner however fee commentary on i cor cite some example from ancient literature of homosexual relationship that do seem to involve free adult in a reasonably symmetrical way thu the consideration in thi paragraph should be push too far homosexuality may have be discredit for jew by some of these association but there surely must be be case that be not prostitute and do not involve slave or child some person have argue that aid be a judgement against homosexuality i like to point out that aid be transmit by promiscuou sex both homosexual and heterosexual someone who ha a homosexual relationship that meet christian criterium for marriage be not at risk for aid note that there be good reason from paul general approach to doubt that he would concede homosexuality a a fully equal alternative apart from any specific statement on homosexuality i believe hi use of the genesi story would lead him to regard heterosexual marriage a what god ordain however the way paul deal with pastoral question provide a warn against be too quick to deal with thi issue legally i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christian be not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one paul tendency a we can see in issue such a eat meat and celebrate holiday be to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issue to look very carefully at the good of the person involve and to avoid insist on perfection when it would be personally damage for example while paul clearly believe that it wa acceptable to eat meat he want u to avoid push person into do an action about which they have personal qualm for another example paul obviously would have prefer to see person at least in some circumstance remain unmarried yet if they be unable to do so he certainly would rather see them marry than in a state where they might be tempt to fornication i believe one could take a view like thi even while accept the view paul express in rom one may believe that homosexuality be not what god intend that it occur a a result of sin but still conclude that at time we have to live with it note that in the creation story work enter human life a a result of sin thi do mean that christian can stop work when we be save the question be whether you believe that homosexuality be in itself sinful or whether you believe that it a misfortune that be in a broad sense due to human sinfulnes if you will to consider the latter approach then it become a pastoral judgement whether there be more damage cause by find a way to live with it or try to cure it the danger of try to cure it be that the attempt most often fail and when it do you end up with damage range from psychological damage to suicide a well a break marriage when attempt at live a a heterosexual fail thi be go to depend upon one assessment of the inherent nature of homosexuality if you believe it be a very seriou wrong then you may be will to run high risk of seriou damage to get rid of it clearly we do not generally suggest that person live with a tendency to steal or with drug addiction even though attempt to cure these condition be also very difficult however these condition be intrinsically damage in a way that be not so obviou for homosexuality many problem associate with homosexuality be actually problem of promiscuity not homosexuality thi include aid i take for grant that the only sort of homosexual relationship a christian would consider allow would be equivalent to christian heterosexual relationship in the course of discuss thi over the last decade or so we hear a lot of personal testimony from fellow christian who be in thi situation i also see summary of variou research and the result of variou effort for conversion aside from the presbyterian report mention above there an faq that summarize my reader report on thi question the evidence be that long-term succes in change orientation be rare enough to be on a par with heal miracle the danger in advise christian to depend upon such a change be clear when conversion do happen which be almost alway the person be often leave in despair feel exclude from a church that ha nothing more to say but a requirement of life-long celibacy paul recognize though in a different context that such a demand be not practical for most person and i think the history of clerical celibacy ha strongly reinforce that judgement the practical result be that homosexual end up in the gay sex club and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality maybe homosexuality be god original ideal but i can well imagine paul prefer to see person in long-term commit christian relationship than promiscuity a with work which genesi suggest wa part of god original ideal either i think such relationship can still be a vehicle for person share god love with each other there an issue of biblical interpretation underlie thi discussion the issue be that of cultural relativism that be when paul say that something be wrong should thi be take a an eternal statement or be thing wrong because of specific situation in the culture of the time conservative christian generally insist on take prohibition a absolute since otherwise the bible become subjective what be to stop u from consider everything in it a relative when look at thi issue it worth note that no one completely reject the concept of cultural relativism there be a number of judgement in the new testament that even conservative christian consider to be relative the follow judgement be at least a clear in the bible a anything say on homosexuality prohibition against charge interest thi occur time in the ot it not in the nt but i mention it here because until relatively recently the church do consider it bind on christian prohibition against swear oath endorsement of slavery a an institution judgement of tax collector a sinner we do not regard these item a bind in most case i believe the argument be essentially one of cultural relativism briefly prohibition of interest be appropriate to a specific agrarian society that the bible wa try to build but not to my market economy few person believe that american judicial oath have the same characteristic a the kind of oath jesu wa concern about most person believe that paul wa simply tell person how to live within slavery but not endorse it a an institution for person believe that the ir be morally equivalent to roman tax farm the point i try to make be that before apply biblical prohibition to the cent we need to look at whether the cent action be the same when christian homosexual say that their relationship be different than the greek homosexuality that paul would have be familiar with thi be exactly the same kind of argument that be be make about judicial oath and tax collector until fairly recently christian prohibit take of interest and many christian regard slavery a divinely endorse indeed slavery be one of the more common metaphor for the relationship between god and human be christian be often call servant or slave of god i be not try to say that everything in the bible be culturally relative rather i try to say that some thing be and therefore it be not enough to say that because something appear in the bible that end the discussion we need to look at whether the action we talk about now ha the same moral implication a the one that the bible wa talk about if christian want to argue that there be reason to think that the prohibition against homosexuality be still bind i will to listen those who claim that the question do need to be look at be kid themself unles they be part of the small minority who really obey all the rule list above one thing that worry me be the great emotion that thi issue create when you consider the weaknes of the biblical evidence some law in leviticu a passage in rom whose subject matter be really idolatry rather than homosexuality and a couple of list whose word be ambiguou the amount of concern thi be raise among christian seem rather out of proportion thi should suggest to person that there be reason other than simply biblical involve thi be true on both side clearly homosexual christian be a strongly motivate to find way of discredit the biblical argument a conservative christian be to find biblical argument but i ca help feel that the bible be be use by both side a a way of justify attitude which come from other source thi be a dangerou situation for christian on the other side of the issue i would like to note some problem i have with the pro-homosexual position a it be commonly present one of the most common argument be that homosexuality be biologically determine god make me homosexual and i have no choice i think god make me homosexual be a fine view for person who already believe on other grind that homosexuality be acceptable but i do see it a an argument for acceptability many person think that alcholism be largely biological and drug addiction may turn out to be a well that do mean it ok most of u have particular thing we tend to do wrong some person get angry easily other tend to be arrogant other tend to be attraced to woman who be marry to someone else homosexuality if we view it a wrong would be different than any of these other thing if we be go to follow god we all end up at one time or another have to work to overcome bad habit and particular temptation that cause u problem none of u can sit back and say that because god make u the way we be we can just relax a jesu say we all have to take up my cro daily thi concept of die to self which also appear throughout paul letter seem to suggest that there be go to be thing about ourself that we we be call on not to accept paul letter and the experience of christian throughout history show u that sin be ingrain in u and the battle against it be lifelong and difficult the fact that homosexuality be difficult to fight do necessarily say it ok maybe thi be the place where we have to die to self but i like to make sure that those who think it be be fight the battle somewhere else and not reject the concept that all christian have to fight against the deeply engrained habit of sin
