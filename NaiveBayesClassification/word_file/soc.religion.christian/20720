from subject could anyone answer thi question i hear it say that the account we have of christ life and ministry in the gospel be actually write many year after the event about year or so is thi correct if so why the big time delay i know all scripture be inspire of god so the time of write be i suppose un-important but i still ca help be curiou ivan thoma barr contact me at the gospel be date so we can only gues luke prolog be about the only thing we have from the author describe hi proces the prolog sound like luke be from the next generation and have to do some investigate there be tradition pass down verbally that say a few thing about the composition of the gospel there be debate about how reliable these tradition be they certainly do have the statu of scripture yet scholar tend to take some of them seriously one suggest that mark wa base on peter sermon and wa write to preserve them when peter have die or way about to die one tradition about matthew suggest that a collection of jesu word may have be make earlier than the current gospel in the ancient world it wa much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information i think many person would have prefer to hear about jesu directly from someone who have know him and maybe even from someone who study directly under such a person rather than from a book thu i suspect that the gospel be largely from a period when these person be begin to die scholar generally do think there wa some write material earlier which wa probably use a source for the exist gospel establishing the date be a complex and technical busines i have to confes that i not sure how much reliance i put on the method use but it common to think that mark wa write first around ad and that all of the gospel be write by the end of the century a few person vary thi by a decade or so one way or the other clh
