from dsegard daniel segard subject re easter what in a name wa re new testament double stan mcovingt michael covington write and the same go for other cultural practice the festival of easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival but today there be a far a i know no christian who intend to honor any kind of pagan goddes by celebrate easter that argument would be more compel if it be not for the ishtar egg and ishtar bunny why mix pagan fertility symbol from the worship of the pagan goddes of fertility with biblical belief what would really be lose if all of you be to just drop the word easter and replace all such occurance with resurrection sunday would you not show up for service if they be call resurrection sunday service rather than easter service
