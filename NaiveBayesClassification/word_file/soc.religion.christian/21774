from hardy rus hardy subject mary and idol i have be study the bible now for about a year i love it but i be not very familiar with the different denomination or tradition or common belief of variou christian group i have hear variou person outside thi news group describe idol such a power money material possession etc these thing be worship in some sense i suppose but i never really give idol much think until now i have be read the post in thi news group which i just find a few day ago and i have a question first i not try to question anyone belief or try to push my view on anyone else i have be at thi long enough to have any view other than i can not get to heaven by be good i must understand that christ bore my sin on the cro so that i could be save and i need to repent realize that every time i sin i might a well stick a sharp stick in christ side because he take the punishment for my sin when he die on the cro in my study mary never really come up i know who she be but that about it it seem to me that a statue of mary could be consider an idol do person pray to statue of mary it sound like educate christian more educate than myself i sure believe mary wa sinles wow i hop to spend the summer convince myself one way or the other about tongue i read charismatic chao i gues i study tongue in parallel with read thi news group any help you can give me will be appreciate i do think the issue be so much that person be more educate than you though it may well be that they be a that they come from a different tradition than your thi be a discussion between catholic and protestant catholic generally believe that mary wa sinles protestant do not the issue come down to different source of authority protestant generally limit themself to the bible a a source of doctrine since thi be in the bible except in passage that no one would understand in thi way if they do already believe it protestant do accept it catholic see continue revelation through the church though they believe the result be consistent with the bible i interpret ymy post not a a call for yet another argument about whether the catholic marian devotion be idolatry an argument i be not prepare to see newed here but a a sign of be interest in learn about tradition other than ymy own catholic be of course a major one but by no mean the only one i generally consider the major tradition to be catholic orthodox and variou subset of protestantism within protestantism it a matter of how finely you want to cut thing these day i think the major division be between those who accept biblical inerrancy and those who do there be also a number of major historical tradition but in recent decade distinction be tend to blur i identify the major protestant tradition a lutheran reformed anglican they sort of halfway between catholic and protestant wesleyan baptist holines pentecostal church of christ but there be a number of other historical distinction tend not to be so important among the liberal church anymore and i think current trend in society and the church be also tend to make conservative see themself a ally from a general evangelical perspective but difference among these variou tradition be still quite mark i think the best introduction to these issue be to read a good book on church history anyone who want to understand the church really need to understand how we get where we be now a church history will normally show you where each of these tradition come from and give a feel for their nature unfortunately i away from my library at the moment so i do have anything specific to recommend clh
