from geno subject re christianity and repeat life there be nothing in christianity that preclude the idea of repeat life on earth there be a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion clearly make a positive inference to reincarnation i do remember which one it be off of the top of my head but it basically go like thi jesu be talk with the apostle and they ask him why the pharisee say that before the messiah can come elijah must first come jesu reply that elijah ha come but they do not recognize him it then say that the apostle perceive that he wa refer to john the baptist thi seem to me to clearly imply reincarnation can anyone offer a reasonable alternative interpretation i would be very interest to hear it
