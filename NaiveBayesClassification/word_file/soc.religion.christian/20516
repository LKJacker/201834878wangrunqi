from jayne jayne kulikauska subject re post jono jon ogden write my advice be thi if you know someone that you have the hot for who be not a christian befriend them and try to develop just a friendship with them at the same time witnes and share the gospel with them not so that you can date them but so that they can be save once they become a christian then it be quite possible to let the relationship progress beyond friendship however if they do accept christ you still have a good friendship and you have waste a lot of emotional energy and get hurt while i agree with most of jon say i delete those part of course i have seriou reservation about thi advice maintaining a just friend level of relationship be much easier say than do person usually end up get hurt thi be especially likely to happen when they start off with feel of attraction when person feel attract those feel can cloud their judgement i have the experience of go quickly from believe that i should date non-christian to believe that date thi man would be okay to believe that premarital sex be fine when person really love each other when the relationship end my belief immediately return to their original state thi be an especially extreme case because i wa young and away from home and fellowship i do think it would work exactly thi way for most person however it important not to underestimate the power of feel of attraction jayne kulikauska jayne
