from mserv subject ten commandment or ten discourse in the course of discuss the sabbath with some folk i come acros something that wa completely new to me and i think i offer it for comment to keep thi a brief a possible let me state my observation a a declarative statement and then whoever want to can comment on it basically what i think i observe be that the phrase the ten commandment a use by mosis be not a reference to ex but rather a reference to ten distinct discourse from ex through ex that be the phrase the ten commandment should more accurately be translate the ten discourse of which the passage we call the ten commandment be really only the first i not completely convince that the above be true but for purpose of discussion let me argue it a though i wa sure argument support the above idea there be really ten commandment in ex in order to get commandment you have to get two of them out of verse and the verse themself do not support such a division because they be all about not worship other god that be verse command to have no other god and verse command to not worship the idol mention in verse you ca violate verse without violate verse indicate that the whole passage be one command and leave u with only nine commandment i could go on at length about thi but for now i just stop with thi summary there are ten speech between ex the begin of the traditional ten commandment and ex where god actually gife mosis the two tablet with the ten write on them i break these ten down a follow and in most case each of these passage begin with some variation of the phrase and the lord speak to mosis say the exception be ex which begin now these be the ordinance which you be to set before them the word translate commandment in the phrase the ten commandment be really the word for commandment it the word for a speech or an utterance it a word often use for longer discourse rather than individual statement for instance when combine with the word day thi word be translate chronicle in such phrase a now the rest of the act of so-and-so be they not write in the chronicle of x the word for commandment be freely use throughout the book of mosis and perhap it be significant that when mosis speak of the ten x he appear to have avoid the word for commandment and choose instead a word associate with discourse longer than just a single command god tell mosis that he be go to give him the stone tablet with the law and the commandment ex yet he do not give mosis the tablet until he ha finish all ten discourse on mount sinai if the ten commandment be only ex it be not immediately clear why god would wait several day and nine more discourse before give these tablet to mosis on the other hand if we have the ten discourse write on the tablet then it make perfect sense that god would not give mosis the tablet until he have finish deliver all ten discourse when mosis do get the tablet he find that both tablet be write on both side ex if these ten commandment be only the first verse of ex god would have have to have write in large letter not that he could have of course but it do seem more likely to me that thi be a reference to two tablet contain ten discourse write in normal size letter in ius cor paul seem to specifically single out the commandment write on stone a be the ministry of death that which be fade away and the ministry of condemnation with the possible exception of the commandment about the sabbath it be difficult to see why paul would refer to the command in ex a be temporary fade away type commandment thi be le of a problem if the stone tablet should happen to have include all of the commandment from ex through ex argument against thi idea the main argument against thi idea aside from the fact that it contradict a long-standing tradition be that in dt mosis say after quote the command in ex these word the lord speak and he add no more and he write them on two tablet of stone and give them to me thi appear to identify the word just quote a be the only content of the two stone tablet that wa my first impression anyway however after some think i note that a great deal hinge on how you understand the phrase these word if mosis mean these word which i have just relate to you be speak by god etc then that would mean that only the traditional ten commandment be on the stone tablet if however mosis wa make a parenthetical comment these word which i am now tell you be speak by god etc then that quite different i do note that in the dt account mosis tell of be give the stone tablet before tell of the person ask mosis to represent them before god wherea in the exodu account the person ask thi of mosis between the first and second discourse several day before god give mosis the stone tablet thi reinforce the idea that mosis remark in dt be intend a a parenthetical remark rather than a strictly chronological account of when god write what and at what point he stop add to what wa on the tablet summary all thing consider i find it somewhat more likely that the nine command in ex be really only the first of what mosis regard a the ten discourse of god i do know if anybody ha ever espouse thi idea before it brand-new to me so while i lean toward accept it i would be very interest in hear any comment and criticism anyone may care to offer mark
