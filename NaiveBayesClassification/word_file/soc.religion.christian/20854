from d andrew byler subject re sabbath admission all of the argument concern the sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear anyone outside of the catholic or orthodox oranglican or monophysite church ourght to worship on saturday if they be really sola scriptura otherwise they be follow a law put into effect by the church and only the above chruch really recognize any power of the chruch to do so andy byler you will note that nothing in the faq say anything about the church establish or change a law the argument against the sabbath be that it be part of the ceremonial law and like the rest of the ceremonial law be not bind on christian thi argument be base on paul letter act and in a more general sense jesu teach further most person argue that scripture show worship occur on sunday and paul endorse it i understand that these point be dispute and do not want to go around the dispute one more time the point i make here be not that these argument be right but that the back they claim be scripture accepting the principle of sola scriptura do not commit u to obey the entire jewish law act and paul letter be quite clear on that i think even the sda accept it the disagreement be on where the bible would have u place the line by the way protestant do give authority to the church in matter that be not dictate by god that why church be free to determine their own liturgy church polity etc if you accept that the sabbath be not bind on christian then the day of worship fall into the category of item on which individual christian or since worship be by it nature a group activity church be free to decide clh
