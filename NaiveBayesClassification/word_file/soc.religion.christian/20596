from caralv carol alvin subject re the arrogance of christian vbv virgilio dean b velasco jr write in article caralv carol alvin write are all truth also absolute is all of scripture truth and therefore absolute if the answer to either of these question be no then perhap you can explain to me how you determine which part of scripture be truth and which truth be absolute the answer to both question be ye perhap we have different definition of absolute then to me an absolute be something that be constant acros time culture situation etc true in every instance possible do you agree with thi definition i think you do similarly all truth be absolute indeed a non-absolute truth be a contradiction in term when be something absolute when it be alway true obviously if a truth be not alway true then we have a contradiction in term a simple example in the new testament sorry i do have a bible at work and ca provide a reference woman be instruct to be silent and cover their head in church now thi be scripture by ymy definition thi be truth and therefore absolute do woman in ymy church speak do they cover their head if all scripture be absolute truth it seem to me that woman speak in and come to church with bare head should be intolerable to evangelical yet clearly woman do speak in evangelical church and come with bare head at least thi wa the case in the evangelical church i grow up in evangelical be clearly not take thi particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there be plenty of other example can you reconcile thi many person claim that there be no absolute in the world such a statement be terribly self-contradictory let me put it to you thi way if there be no absolute should we conclude that the statement there be no absolute be not absolutely true obviously we have a contradiction here i do claim that there be no absolute i think there be very few though and determine absolute be difficult thi be just one of the reason why christian defy the world by claim that there be indeed absolute in the universe there be hardly consensu even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regard biblical interpretation so person sometime disagree about what be true thi do not negate the fact however that there be still absolute in the universe but you be claim that all of scripture be absolute how can you determine absolute derive from scripture when you ca agree how to interpret the scripture it very difficult to see how you can claim something which be base on ymy own interpretation be absolute do you deny that ymy own background education prejudice etc come into play when you read the bible and determine how to interpret a passsage do you deny that you in fact interpret carol alvin caralv
