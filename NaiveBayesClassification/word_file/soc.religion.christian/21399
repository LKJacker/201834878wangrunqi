from d andrew byler subject deuterocanonical esp sirach dave davi write let my state my point a provocatively a possible after go through several study bible i lean heavily toward the assertion that sirach wisdom of ben sira or be directly reference by jame in fact i think sirach be more directly reference by jame than job or ruth be reference in any nt verse i see good point the new testament do not quote ezra nehemiah esther ruth job ecclesiaste or song of song just a it do not quote from the deuterocanon but if the non-quotation of the former do not disqualify them neither do the non-quotation of the later and the wisodm of solomon wa quite clearly an influence on st paul especially in the letter to the roman cf especially roman and wisdom stuff delete i think everyone would agree that principle that can not be consistently apply be not very useful a principle so if we be to exclude them not accord them the authority of scripture we would appear to require other reason what might these reason be tradition alway a fav with episcop tradition be equivocal on thi subject sirach i believe be in vaticanu sinaiticu i do know if it be list in the muratorian canon the oldest list i know of sirach and the other be discuss by the father a scripture but not unanimously true not all accept them a scripture though niether be all the book of the new testament so accept which put to the lie the whole argument of the book be exclude because they be debate and not universally accept hebrew the apocalypse peter esther and other be debate at variou time but eventually retain a for the codex you mention both vaticanu and sinaitcu include the deuterocanon bothe of the new and old testament and vaticanu i think inlcude clement the shepard of herma and the epistle of baranaba a for the muratorian canon it deal with the new testament only though it be very valuable in it witnes to those book my interim conclusion be that protestant exclusion of at least one of these write be one of those of man one hear of so often they be exclude during the reformation and that appear to be the reason many person continue to exclude them any taker i can be reasonable if all else fail show me where i wrong you not wrong it be a tradition of man to exlcude them a i will explain below that nothing be read in the church under the nma of divine scripture except the canonical scripture and the canoncial scripture be genesi exodu leviticu number deuteronomy joshua judge ruth fmy book of kingdom be samuel and king two book of paralpomenon be chronicle job the psalter of david the five book of solomon be proverb ecclesiaste song of song wisdom of solomon and misatributed to him the wisdom of jesu son of sirach the book of the twelve minor prophet isaiah jeremiah be jeremiah the lamentation baruch and the letter all of which be formerly count a one ezekiel daniel tobit judith esther two book of ezra be ezra and nehemiah two book of maccabee and of the new testament fmy book of the gospel one book of the act of the apostle thirteen letter of paul the apostle one letter of the same to the hebrew two of peter the apostle three of john one of the apostle jude one of the apostle jame one book of the apocalypse of john council of hippo statute ad thi same list wa promulgate again at the third council of carthage ad and at the sixth council of carthage ad at which council the same list wa enumerate with the word because we have recieved from the father that these be the book to be read in the church which ought to quiet those who assert in the name of holy scripture we do understand those book of whose authority there wa never any doubt in the church a the episcopal church do in remove the deuterocanon from the realm of scripture though the episcopalian hold them in high regard and read them in the church they be not count a scripture by them and may not be use to prove dogma the lutheran hold out similarly earlier mention of the so-called apocrypha a divine scripture can also be find and below i inlcude only a portion of the quote call it divine scripture that could be find among the write of the father and thi be the reason why the law of the old testament be reckon a consist of twenty-two book so that they may correspond to the number of letter in the hebrew alphabet it be to be note also that by add to these tobia and judith there be twenty-fmy book correspond to the number of letter use by the greek st hillary of poitier commentary on the psalm prologue ad the twenty-two book accord to the hebrew be jeremiah with lamentation and the letter reckon a one and also there be maccabee origen commentary on the psalm psalm ad divine scripture address itself to those who love themself and to the boastful say most excellently baruch follow st clement of alexandrium the instuctor of child ad i learn accurately the book of the old testament proverb of solomon and also wisdom st melito of sarde fragment find in eusebiu history of the church and date from crica ad book it be likewise decree now indeed we must treat of the divine scripture what the universal catholic church accept and what she must shun the list of the old testament wisdom one book ecclesiasticu one book tobit one book judith one book of maccabee two book st damasu i pope the decree of damsu section ad i would think thi enough though more can be show that the church ha alway accept the deutero-canon though part have be dispute by variou person for if dispute involve the new testament deutero-canon do not disqulaify those book hebrew jame peter john jude revelation in protestant eye than neither should it disqulaify the old testament book and i must point out that the jew only draw up their canon in ad year after the found of the christian religion upon the cros why should we adhere to a canon that wa draw up by the faithles in reaction to the chrsitian use of the greek septuagint which include the deutero-canon a early a ad st justin have already accuse the jew of mutilate the canon of scripture by their removal of certain book protestant apparently prefer to think that god revelation wa limit by a decree of the jew in the order of their the jew faithles canon and that he could not use other person like the apostle in draw up the canon the apostle be most certain user of the septuagint a some of the old testament quote use the word of the septuagint and not the hebrew and the septuagint include the deuterocanon
