from marka mark ashley subject re question about virgin mary i think you talk about the assumption of the blessed virgin mary it say that the immaculate mother of god the ever virgin mary have complete the course of her earthly life wa assume body and soul into heavenly glory thi wa define by a papal statement in though it have certainly be believe by some before that like the immaculate conception thi be primarily a roman catholic doctrine and like it it ha no direct biblical support note that catholic do not believe in sola scriptura that be they do not believe that the bible be the only source of christian knowledge thu the fact that a doctrine ha little biblical support be not necessarily significant to them they believe that truth can be pass on through tradition of the church and also that it can be reveal to the church i not interest in yet another argument but if any catholic can tell u the basi for these belief i think it would be appropriate clh in the bible there be a lot of instance where god speak to person where a person just come to know some piece of information where a person walk off into the desert for day etc with all of god power he certainly can do whatever he want when he want it the bible end with the book of revelation but do god reign end there no so who can say for sure that god message be either no longer happen or still happen i can now hear the clamor for proof with the cold response i get from the past from thi group it very hard to get the point acros i only go over the physical stuff so that skeptic can look at document store somewhere i cite the uncorrupted body of saint before they still there the apparition at fatima portugal culminate in a miracle specifically grant to show god existence that wa the of the sun it wa see in several country that event be approve by the pope currently image of mary in japan korea yugoslavium philippine africa be show tear natural or blood these be still under investigation by the church but realize that investigation take decade to finish and if the message be christ will come in ten day that a bite too late be it other event under investigation be inner locution come to know stigmatum the person exhibit christ wind and they do heal and doctor do know why non-believer be welcome to pore through document i sure thi stuff be not like koresh or oral robert give me or god will call me home it free find out why they happen a we ourself be study why if anybody can figure thi out tell u you can be of any religion if you have the resource go to one of the country i mention these be not member only event god and mary invite everybody so in conclusion finally we rc believe in the modern day manifestation of god and mary we be scar to death sometime although we tell not to there be more proof and event and that be why not everything be in the bible although in a lot of the apparition we be tell to read the bible a far a the protestant v catholic issue be concern in the end god church will unite i not sure how i have some idea but the point be we should worry about the versu part just do god work that all that matter unity will come btw i just a plain person i not the pope spokesperson but i be rc mark ashley disclaimer my opinion not harri marka the lost lo angelino
