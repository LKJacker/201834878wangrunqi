from aaron scott aaron subject re latest on branch davidian in article conditt paul conditt write i think it really sad that so many person put their faith in a mere man even if he do claim to be the son of god a prophet i pose a question here that get me think what distinguish true religion from cult i speak generally here not specifially about christianity jerry falwell wa on good morning america on tuesday ostensibly to answer thi question basically he say that true religion follow a message wherea a cult follow a person but then christianity be a cult because the message of christianity is the person of jesu so what distinguish for example the branch davidian cult from the presbyterian church doctrinal difference do answer the question imho so do use them a an answer scott at brandei but god demonstrate hi the lord bles you and keep you own love for u in that the lord make hi face shine on you while we be yet sinner and be graciou to you christ die for u the lord lift up hi countenance on you and give you peace roman nasb number nasb there have be some attempt to characterize cult most commonly it use characteristic involve high pressure brainwash technique etc but some person characterize it by doctrinal error in the end i afraid it become a term with no precise mean that use primarily to dismis group a not worthy of seriou consideration that do mean that there be group that do highly irresponsible thing and have seriou doctrinal error but past discussion have not suggest to me that cult be a very helpful term clh
