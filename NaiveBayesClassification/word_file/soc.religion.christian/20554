from mhsu melinda hsu subject re the arrogance of christian i like to share my think on thi topic of arrogance of christian and look forward to any response in my encounter with christian i find myself dismay by their belief that their faith be total truth according to them their belief come from the bible and the bible be the word of god and god be truth thu they know the truth thi stance make it difficult to discus other faith with them and my own hesitation about christianity because they see no other way their way be the but i see their faith arise from a willful choice to believe a particular way that choice be part faith and part reason but it seem to me a choice my discussion with some christian remind me of schoolyard discussion when i wa in grade school a kid would say all policeman be jerk i ask how do you know because my daddy tell me so how do you know you daddy be right he say he alway right well the argument usually stop right there in the end be we all just kid grope for the truth if so do we have the authority to declare all other belief beside my own a false thi be only my third time browse through thi newsgroup i apologize if i cover tire old grind some of the discussion on thi topic have pique my interest and i welcome any comment loui j kim o southwest research institute post office drawer lkim san antonio tx i sort of mystify about how a christian might respond to thi i can understand criticism of christianity that say there not enough evidence to believe it or that there just a good evidence for other religion i do agree but clearly there be plenty of intelligent person who do find the evidence convince but that do seem to be ymy point rather you seem upset that person who believe christianity be true also believe that thing which contradict it be false thi suggest a model of spiritual thing that rather different than the christian one it sound more like an existentialist view where person choose what value to follow but there no actual independent spiritual reality and so no way to say that a specific choice be in some unique sense right thi sort of model with modification of one sort or another may be appropriate for some religion but christianity be in it essense a historical religion that be it base on the concept that there be actual spiritual entity out there that one of them ha intervene in history in specific way and that we see evidence of that in history in the mundane world we be not free to choose how thing work when we drop something it fall aside from well-defined situation where it do the christian concept be that spiritual matter there be also an actual external reality i hope we all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understand but while we may not think we know everything we be confident that we know some thing and that imply that we think thing that contradict them be false i do see how else we could proceed thi need result in arrogance i certainly interest in talk with person of other religion they may have thing to teach me and even if they do i respect them a fellow human be but it get to be possible to respect person and also think that on some matter they be wrong maybe even disasterously wrong clh
