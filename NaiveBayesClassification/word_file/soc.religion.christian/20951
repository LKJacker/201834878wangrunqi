from dan johnson subject re intolerance eternal life etc i apologize if thi article be slightly confuse and late the origonal draft do make it through the moderator quote-screen so i do violence to it but if you remember the article i be respond to it should still make sence in article jsledd jame sledd write hi xian netter god bles you what no hello for heathan netter i feel all leave out now deletium table of content intro homosexuality incredibly chopped up post deletium incorrect attribution uh you have ymy attribution wrong you be respond to my article so dan johnson should be the one in article jayne jayne kulikauska write deletium no free gift speil nuke by moderator fiat i find that i be dissatisfy with the little purpose that we can manufacture for ourself little in the cosmic sense ah in the cosmic sence but who life in the cosmic sence not me cosmicly we do even exist for all practical purpose i can hardly use the cosmic sence of stuff a a guide to life it would just say do bother luckily for mortal there be many sence of scale you can talk about in a human sence you can have big purpose even the greatest of the great pharo be long go the pyramid historical oddity be wear down by the wind eventually to be turn into dust but the influence of aristotle confuciou alexander ceasar and countles other be still with u although their work have perish but they have change to course of history and while humanity exist their deed can not be say to have come to nothing even if they be utterly forget mankind itself will one day perish one day surely well unles you believe in the second coming which i do not but in that time we can make a difference without some interconnectednes that transcend the physical without god it be all pointles in the end in the end but it must be the end until then there be all the point you can muster and when that end come there will be nobody to ask gee i do think jame sledd deed be gon na make much of a difference ulitmately ya know but they will have already have make a difference great or small before the end why must ymy end be eternal to be worthwhile most person be able to live with that and for them little purpose succes money power effect change help other suffice little be in the eye of the beholder of course i suppose they never think about the cosmic scale or be at least able to put it out of their mind i do doubt it but i have think about the cosmic scale and it do not seem to mean much to u here today to me it be comfort to know that reality be an illusion i would not find thi comfort but perhap it be merely my definition here what i think the relevant term be reality that which be real illusion that which be not real but seem to be real objectively existing for reality to be an illusion would mean then that which be real be not real but seem to be or that which objectively exist do not objectively exist but do seem to objectively exist from which we can conclude that unles you want to get a contradiction that no thing objectively exist but i have a problem with thi because i would like to say that i objectively exist if nothing else cogito ergo sum and all that perhap you do not mean all that but rather mean objective reality be unreachable by human which be not so bad and so far a i know be true that the true reality underneath the the physical be spirit have on if reality be an illusion be true reality an illusion too and if true reality be spirit that make spirit an illusion a well if i be not distinctly confuse thi be get positively buddhist that thi world be a school of sort where we learn and grow and my soul mature that be one hell of a statement although perhap true do you mean to imply that it wa intend to be so if so please show that thi be true if not please explain how thi can give a purpose to anything that gife a purpose to my little purpose how do it do that would the w intent idea make the world a preparation for some greater purpose rather than a purpose in itself and take some of the pressure off what pressure it not so necessary to make thi life a succes in human term if you really just here to learn it be not necessary to be a succes in human term unles ymy goal either include do so or require do so before they themself can be achived indeed many person have set goal for themself that do not include succes in human term a i understand it check out yer buddhist monk type guy out for nirvana which be not at all the same thing it more important to progress grow persist to learn to love yourself and other and to expres ymy love especially when it dificult to do so honest effort be reward by god he know my limitation why be learn to love a goal what happen if you fail in thi goal to you to god to the mysteriou purpose deletium question about immortailty and my answer delete because it wa mostly quote two seriou to discussion what be the nature of eternal life how can we a mortal lock into space time conceive of it possible answer for the best we can do be question what be the best metaphor i have a crack at that the nature of eternal life be neatly describe by it name it be the concept of life without death life without end no we can put together word to describe it but we can not imagine it no metaphor be adequate next to eternity if it be we could not understand it either or so i suspect dan johnson and god say jeeze thi be dull and it wa dull genesi these opinion probably show what i know
