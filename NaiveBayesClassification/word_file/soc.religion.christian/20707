from hall vice hal f lillywhite yapg subject re help in article lmvec william hargreaf write i a commit christian that be battle with a problem i know that roman talk about how we be save by my faith not my deed yet hebrew and jame say that faith without deed be useles say you fool do you still think that just believe be enough actually i do think there be any conflict if we really understand what these passage say first what be faith if you study the mean of the greek and hebrew word so translate i think you will come to the conclusion that the word mean a lot more than mere belief faith mean both trust and action if you do not put ymy belief into action it simply can not qualify a faith i think thi be what jame mean when he say that faith without work be dead and i will show you my faith by my work remember jame wa write to the twelve tribe which be scatter abroad thi probably mean he wa write to those who would hear the gospel much later and would understand the mean of the original greek indeed i suspect jame wa write to u today among other he intend to reach paul on the other hand write mostly to the person of the roman empire who generally understand the mean of the greek another key to why there be no conflict be to look at paul statement in their context i think you will find that when paul contrast faith and work it be in the context of compare the gospel with the law mean the law of mosis thi wa the great burden of paul life a the apostle to the gentile he would go convert a bunch of person then the judizer would come along and try to convince them that they also have to obey the law of mosis cf act chapter in thi context paul condemn the idea of be save by the work of the law say that we be save by the blood of jesu and my faith in him i believe that a better translation for today would be that we be save by faithfulnes i think faithfulnes today ha a mean closer to what the original writer intend now if someone be fully believe but there life be totally lead by themself and not by god accord to roman that person be still save by there faith i think you misunderstand roman what paul be really say be that god prefer a faithful gentile who do not keep kosher to a kosher jew who fail to stay faithful in the more important matter of follow the lord and have charity toward hi fellow but then there be the bite which say that god prefere someone who be cold to him do know him condemn so a lukewarm christian someone who know and believe in god but do make any attempt to live by the bible in the sense of faith describe above you can not have real faith and be lukewarm if you know god but be lukewarm unfaithful you be worse off than the person who never hear of him remember jesu in the parable of the pearl of great price mat and again in the one on the treasure hide in the field mat indicate that the price of the kingdom of god be all we have i agree with you in general include the fact that pisti ha some of the force of faithful however if you take that too far you can end up with something that paul definitely would not have intend being faithful mean follow god in all thing to say that we be save by be faithful be very close to say that we be save by commit no sin i assume that not what you mean i have almost give up on find a specific verbal formula that completely capture thi however i think paul be describe what i call a basic orientation include aspect such a trust and commitment jesu speak of it a rebirth which imply a basic change we may still do thing that be sinful and may fail to show the new life in christ in many situation where we should but in any christian there have better be the basic change in orientation that jesu call be bear again clh
