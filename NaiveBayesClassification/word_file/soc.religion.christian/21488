from geno subject re the doctrine of original sin if baby be not suppose to be baptise then why do the bible ever say so it never come right and say only person that know right from wrong or who be teach can be baptise thi be not a very sound argument for baptise baby it assume that if the bible do say specifically that you do need to do something then that must mean that you do need to do it i know there a specific term for thi form of logic but it escape me right now however if it be sound then you should be able to apply it thi way if the bible do specifically say that something be wrong then it must be ok which coincidentally lead perfectly into a question i often ponder if slavery be immoral which i believe it be can i assume that everyone else in thi group do too why do jesu or any of the apostle speak out against it owning slave wa common practice back then paul speak about everything else that be immoral he apparently think it wa important enough to talk about thing like not be a drunkard why do anyone mention slavery if god moral be eternal and do change like the moral of society then it must have be just a immoral then a it be today
