from bill rea subject re the arrogance of christian carol alvin caralv write in the new testament sorry i do have a bible at work and ca provide a reference woman be instruct to be silent and cover their head in church now thi be scripture by ymy definition thi be truth and therefore absolute do woman in ymy church speak do they cover their head if all scripture be absolute truth it seem to me that woman speak in and come to church with bare head should be intolerable to evangelical yet clearly woman do speak in evangelical church and come with bare head at least thi wa the case in the evangelical church i grow up in evangelical be clearly not take thi particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there be plenty of other example can you reconcile thi the problem you see here be that some christian claim thing about the bible which they do actually believe or practice i know all sort of christian range from the trendiest of liberal to the fire-breathing fundamentalist and although many on the conservative side of the christian faith do claim that the bible be a perhap the source of absolute truth i do know of anyone who treat it a anything other than a valuable part of a live tradition while i be not a roman catholic i believe thi be close to the official position of the rc church perhap an rc would like to comment the particular practice you refer to will usually be explain in term of the social context of the time you would think the fact that the conservative seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why thi other passage a well be directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the bible and what they actually practice be two different thing but mostly it while thi thread be suppose to be about the arrogance of christian i would suggest that some of the problem be really hypocrasy in thi case make claim about the bible which the claimant do actually put into practice but if we step back from the name-calling and look at what person be attempt to say we see that they be try to expres very concisely the unique place the bible hold within the christian faith so when person use such word or phrase a word of god inerrant infallibale the manufacturer handbook the only rule of faith and practice in the church today to describe the bible we should try to hear what they be say and not just look at the mere word they use some of the above description be demostratably false and other be self-contradictory but in my experience person be generally pretty good at pick out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker word be at variance with their intention a biblical example be from the garden of eden where god ask where be you and adam explain that he wa naked and afraid and hide himself if adam have answer god word he would have say something like i here in thi tree the problem seem to arise when christian insist that these word be indeed accurate reflection of their beleif most person have not make a determine effort to work out their own understand of the place of the bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrase and explanation that other use i hope thi help bill rea o o w u w bill rea computer service centre e-mail university of canterbury or christchurch new zealand phone fax
