from geno subject re god morality and massacre jek jame kiefer write stuff delete first point what they be do be wrong just a what joseph brother do wa wrong just a what juda do wa wrong they intend it for evil if god somehow bring good out of it that do not make them any le subject to just condemnation and punishment second point of course god will bring good out of it but not the same good that he would have bring if the serbian have refrain from the sin of robbery and rape and murder nor do the good he purpose excuse u from the duty of do what be right so what you say then be that god exercise direct control or influence upon humanity he do control my every think or action but take what we do whether it be intend for evil or not and turn it into something good it seem to me that thi idea conflict with the belief that god give human free will a far a i can determine it be impossible to reconcile these two different idea if god be to exert hi influence upon anyone or anything at anytime he would be impede upon someone free will unles of course you believe that god do not give u complete and unabated free will but rather some sort of conditional free will something that allow u to make my own choice and control my own life except when god want to use u to fulfill some good purpose of hi own by harden my heart or control u in some other way i hear alot of person who look at variou event mostly catastrophy or thing like the aid epidemic and make comment about god will i have a very difficult time understand why person believe that god control anything that happen on thi planet except possibly when be ask to through someone prayer according to the bible pharoah wa go to let mosis person go after one or two plague but god keep harden hi heart so mosis could cast all plague upon the egyptian the last plague cause the death of many innocent child so then god impede upon pharoah free will and use him a a puppet god do thi not just to free the hebrew but to free them in some sort of a grand fashion i suppose from the hebrew point of view thi could be see a turn something bad into good but i sure the egyptian do see it thi way all of ymy example of how god turn something bad into something good be base upon show favortism to one group of person over another after all it only good base upon ymy point of view why do god who be suppose to be the god of all of humanity play favorite
