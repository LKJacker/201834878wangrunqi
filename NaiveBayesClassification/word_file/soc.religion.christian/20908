from pharvey paul harvey subject re sabbath admission i write in response to dlecoint it not clear how much more need to be say other than the faq i think paul comment on esteem one day over another rom be probably all that need to be say wa paul a god too is an interpretation of the word of paul of higher priority than the direct word of jesu in paul begin roman with if someone be weak in the faith do you count yourself a one who be weak in the faith i accept that dariu be do what he do in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all day alike be similarly do their best to honor the lord ye but what do the bible have to say what do jesu say paul close roman with on the other hand the person with doubt about something who eat it anyway be guilty because he be act on hi faith and any failure to act on faith be a sin gau have you read the ten commandment which be a portion of the law have you read jesu word in is there any doubt in ymy mind about what be right and what be sin greek hamartium miss the mark however i like to be clear that i do not think there unambiguou proof that regular christian worship wa on the first day a i indicate there be response on both of the passage cite wherea the ten commandment and jesu word in be fairly clear be they not the difficulty with both of these passage be that they be actually about something else they both look like they be talk about nnregular christian meet but neither explicitly say and they gather every sunday for worship we get variou piece of information but nothing aim at answer thi question do answer ymy question what day christian meet in their house act despite dariu confusion be describe by act a occur on sunday it do say they gather to see paul off but that when they be gather for break bread breaking bread roughly synonymou with eat so i think the most obviou read of thi be that on the first day of every week simply mean every time they gather for worship how do you unite thi concept of your with the ten commandment and jesu word in i think the reason we have only implication and not clear statement be that the nt author assume that their reader know when christian worship wa clh or they assume that the ten commandment and jesu word in actually stand for something perhap they be strong in the faith no i do believe that paul can overrule god however paul wa write for a largely gentile audience the law wa regard by jew at the time and now a bind on jew but not on gentile there be rule that be bind on all human be the so-called noachic law but they be quite minimal the issue that the church have to face after jesu death wa what to do about gentile who want to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them do say that the law wa abolish it simply acknowledge that fact that it do apply to gentile thu there be no contradiction with mat a far a i can tell both paul and other jewish christian do continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath thu they continue to obey the law the issue wa and be with gentile christian who be not cover by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspect of it jesu deal mostly with jew i think we can reasonably assume that mat wa direct to a jewish audience he do interact with gentile a few time the centurion whose slave wa heal and a couple of other the term use to describe the centurion see luke suggest that he wa a god-fearer a gentile who follow god but have not adopt the whole jewish law he wa commend by jewish elder a a worthy person and jesu accept him a such thi seem to me to indicate that jesu accept the prevail view that gentile need not accept the law however there more involve if you want to compare jesu and paul on the law in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grip with paul apparent rejection of the law and how that relate to jesu commendation of the law at least a i read paul he say that the law serve a purpose that ha be in a certain sense supercede again thi issue be one of the abolition of the law in the middle of hi discussion paul note that he might be understand thi way and assure u that that not what he intend to say rather he see the law a primarily be present to convict person of their sinfulnes but ultimately it an impossible standard and one that ha be supercede by christ paul comment be not the world clearest here and not everyone agree with my read but the interest thing to notice be that even thi radical position do not entail an abolition of the law it still remain a an uncompromising standard from which not an iotum or dot may be remove for it purpose of convict of sin it important that it not be relax however for christian it not the end ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical category they use be rather different in the end i think jesu and paul come to a rather similar conclusion the quote passage from mat should be take in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesu show u how he interpret the law the not an iotum or dot would suggest a rather literal read but in fact that not jesu approach jesu interpretation emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial detail indeed he be well know for take a rather free attitude toward the sabbath and kosher law some scholar claim that mat need to be take in the context of cent jewish discussion jesu accuse hi opponent of care about give a tenth of even the most minor herb but neglect the thing that really matter justice mercy and faith and care about how cup and plate be clean but not about the fact that inside the person who use them be full of extortion and rapacity mat thi and the discussion later in mat suggest that jesu ha a very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talk about maintain the law in it full strength he be think of these aspect of it paul conclusion be similar while he talk about the law be supercede all of the specific example he gife involve the ceremonial law such a circumcision and the sabbath he be quite concern about maintain moral standard the net result of thi be that when paul talk about the law be supercede and jesu talk about the law be maintain i believe they be talk about different aspect of the law paul be embroil in argument about circumcision a be natural in letter respond to specific situation he look at the aspect of the law that be currently cause trouble the law a specifically jewish ceremoney he certainly do not intend to abolish divine standard of conduct on the other hand when jesu commend the law he seem to be talk the law in it broadest implication for moral and human relationship and deemphasizing those aspect that be later to give paul so much trouble it unfortunate that person use the same term in different way but we should be familiar with that from current conflict look at the way term like family value take on special mean from the current context imagine some poor historian of the future try to figure out why family value should be use a a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the i think law have take on a similar role in the argument paul wa involve in paul wa clearly not reject all of the jewish value that go along with the term law any more than person who concern about the family value movement be really oppose to family value clh
