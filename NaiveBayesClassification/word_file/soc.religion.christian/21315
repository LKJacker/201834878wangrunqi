from d andrew byler subject monophysite and mike walker mike walker if you be use the standard formula of fully god and fully human that i not sure why you object to say that jesu wa human i think the usual analysi would be that sin be not part of the basic definition of humanity it a consequence of the fall jesu be human but not a fall human clh the proper term for what mike express be monophysitism thi wa a heresy that wa condemn in the council of chalcedon in ad it grow up in reaction to nestorianism which hold that the son and jesu be two different person who happen to be unite in the same body temporarily monophysitism be hold by the copt of egypt and ethipoium and by the jacobite of syrium and the armenian orthodox it believe that jesu christ wa god which be correct that he wa man which be correct that he wa one person which be correct but that he have only one nature and one will and oen energy which be heretical the orthodox position be that he have two nature and two will and two energy both divine and human though the will be in perfect harmony that be what mike be try to get acros that while jesu come in human form mike say he do not have a human nature or a human will in reality he have both though neither make him subject to original sin it be interest to note that the monothelite be a reaction to thi conflict and attempt to solve the problem by admit two nature but not two will or two energy it also wa condemn at a late council in constantinople i believe andy byler these issue get mighty subtle when you see person say different thing it often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different thing or whether they be use different terminology i do think there any question that there be a problem with nestoriu and i would agree that the say christ have a human form without a real human nature or will be heretical but i like to be a bite wary about the copt armenian etc recent discussion suggest that their monophysite position may not be a far from orthodoxy a many have think nestoriu wa an extreme representative of one of the two major school of think more moderate representative be regard a orthodox theodore of mopsuestium my impression be that the modern monophysite group inherit the entire tradition not just nestoriu version and that some of them may have a sufficient balance position to be regard a orthodox clh
