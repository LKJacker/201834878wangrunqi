from dan a rose arise subject re the arrogance of christian news write arrogance be arrogance it be not the result of religion it be the result of person know or firmly believe in an idea and one desire to show other of one rightnes i assume that god decide to be judge for my sake a much a hi own if we allow him who be kind and merciful be the judge we probably be better off than if other judge u or we judge ourself i not sure i agree with thi i agree that arrogance be not the result of religion and that god be a far better judge than we be i also agree if you mean to say that arrogance show up in the form of try to prove one superior knowledge rightnes or holines over another person belief i need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that i do not fall into the mistake of misrepresent ymy view if i fall down in thi area i hope you will forgive me arrogance be not the result of believe one be right or of believe that one god be greater than the god of other or of believe that one religion be better than other religion these be all naturally self-implied belief it be self-contradictory to say that i believe my current belief to be wrong were i to find myself in error my belief would naturally change and follow what i believe to be right therefore i must alway consider my belief correct that not arrogance that unavoidable behavior it be nonsense to say that i believe another person god to be greater than my god were hi or her god greater would i be obligate to change so that their god would become my god we be naturally obligate to worship that god which we deem to be the greatest why should we feel obligate to worship a second best god for the sake of feel humble arrogance be not necessarily think onesself to be better look or more intelligent or stronger or have more resource than another person no doubt many will have to chew on thi one awhile were passive observation of one superior point arrogance then god would be most arrogant of all humility do not rest in slander or belittle god work of creation in my life person often go around try to be humble say to one another i not very smart i poor i not good look i just a worm in the grind i such a weak person and although i do want to sin i really can not help it were thi person truely humble he would take a different approach god thank you for make me the way you do i know that you never do anything second best yet with all that you have give me i have be so unthankful you give me power to resist the devil i have not use it but have indulge myself in do exactly what you have say not to do i have slander ymy creation in my life and have credit myself with humility for do so lord with all you give me i have be completely unfaithful and i do not deserve ymy forgivenes and yet ymy love for me be so boundles that you would give yourself to die for me to save me a terribly evil a i be i deserve to go straight to hell yet it please you somehow to rescue me from thi terrible life i lead lord please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that i can bring glory to ymy name instead of insult lord i so sorry for my wrong please help me to change i think person take exceptional offense to religiou arrogance because they do want to be wrong if i find someone arrogant i typically do have anything to do with them for me i often find it hard to tell the difference often time the most humble christian ha come acros to me a arrogant while the most proud worm in the grind false humility type person ha be find to be most comfortable company when i wrong and arrogant about my wrongnes i certainly do feel like be confront by my wrongnes were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongnes i be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their fault and charge them with hypocricy for what they say to me at the root my desire would be to make them shut up so that i can go about live my life arrogantly a i wish however be someone to confront me silently by their example earn my respect and perhap mention it to me in humility in private i feel break down and challenge to seek god for help in change from the error of my way the hard part be get to the point to where i can be humble before anyone regardles of their humility or pride regardles of their hypocricy or sincerity regardles of whether onlooker will frown down upon me or not it be easy to take thi pain in love with thankfulnes for the opportunity to improve in one ability to serve god it easier to cast aside any hope of reach true humility and merely hide behind slander god creation in my life instead but we should examine ourself i hope i type thi back in right and why we react to certain situation with such emotion for instance many of u feel justify to be insult by an arrogant person a if we need a reason to feel insult but after be insult over and over again by the word of other you think we either toughen up or decide not to be insult or ignore the insult just because you can justify feel of anger or insult or outrage that do make that reaction the appropriate one it be in thi light of self-examination that we can change my emotional reaction sometime it help when we can understand and feel the difference between what be a true statement of my character and what be a false and slanderou statement of my character the devil be the accuser of the bretheren he would love u to feel hopelessly guilty where we be innocent and feel arrogant and self-righteou where we be indeed wrong the devil aim be to get u into a much misery a he can just think of the devil a a cruel and mercus le criminal who torment a parent by burn hi or her child with hot iron the way the devil get under the father skin be by hurt those that the father love so much i deplore the horrible crime of child murder we want prevention not merely punishment we must reach the root of the evil it be practice by those whose inmost soul revolt from the dreadful deed no mater what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffer the unborn innocent the woman be awfully guilty who commit the deed but oh thrice guilty be he who drive her to
