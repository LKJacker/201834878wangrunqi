from revdak d andrew kille subject re deuterocanonical esp sirach poram write let talk about principle if we accept that god set the standard for what ought to be include in scripture then we can ask is it authoritative authoritative be not a quality of the write itself it be a statement by the community of faith whether it will accept the write a normative is it prophetic how be prophecy to be define if it be speak forth of god message much of the apocrypha must surely qualify is it authentic again by what standard is authenticity a function of the author the historical accuracy is it dynamic what be thi suppose to mean many of the apocryphal book be highly dynamic think provoke faithful even excite is it receive collect read and use by whom of course the apocryphal book be receive by some collect or else we would not have them read and use and they still be in the catholic and orthodox church on these count the apocrapha fall short of the glory of god thi be demonstrably false to quote unger bible dictionary on the apocrapha they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracy and anachronism so do other book of the bible they teach doctrine which be false and foster practice which be at variance with sacred scripture false by whose interpretation those church that accept them find no contradiction with the rest of scripture they resort to literary type and display an artificiality of subject matter and style out of keep with sacred scripture thi be a purely subjective evaluation the apocryphal book demonstrate the same category and form of write find in the other scripture in fact one could argue that the apocryphal addition to the book of esther act rather to bring the unscripturelike book of esther more into line with other book they lack the distinctive element which give genuine scripture their divine character such a prophetic power and poetic and religiou feel have you ever read the wisdom of ben sira or the wisdom of solomon they exhibit every bite a much poetic and religiou feel a psalm or proverb deletion how do you then view the word i warn everyone who hear the word of the prophecy of thi book if anyone add anything to them god will add to him the plague describe in thi book and if anyone take away from thi book the prophecy god will take away from him hi share in the tree of life and in the holy city rev surely thi set the standard and not just man-made tradition these word clearly be mean to refer to the book of revelation alone not to the whole body of scripture revelation itself wa accept very late into the canon the church simply do not see it a have a primary role of any kind in identify and limit scripture it be also noteworthy to consider jesu attitude he have no argument with the pharisee over any of the ot canon john and explain to hi follower on the road to emmau that in the law prophet and psalm which refer to him the ot division of scripture luke a well a in luke take genesi to chronicle the jewish order we would say genesi to malachi a scripture jesu do not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in hi day the canon have not be establish a a close collection the book of the apocrypha be part of the septuagint which wa the bible of the early church the hebrew canon wa not close until the torah pentateuch law wa establish in jesu day a be the prophet with the exclusion of daniel the writing however be still in flux jesu do not refer to the writing only to the psalm which be part of them the book of the apocrypha be all part of the literature that wa eventually sift and separate to argue that jesu be refer to the jewish canonical order in luke be weak at best he be not quote scripture but tell a chronological story and a mention above the hebrew canon especially in the present order do not exist a such in jesu day revdak
