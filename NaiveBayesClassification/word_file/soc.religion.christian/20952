from pharvey paul harvey subject re sabbath admission in article pharvey paul harvey write priority than the direct word of jesu in paul begin roman with if someone be weak in the faith do you count yourself a one who be weak in the faith do you count yourself a one who be weak in the faith you read jesu word in is there any doubt in ymy mind about what be right and what be sin greek hamartium miss the mark is there any doubt in ymy mind about what be right and what be miss the mark however i like to be clear that i do not think there unambiguou proof that regular christian worship wa on the first day a i indicate there be response on both of the passage cite wherea the ten commandment and jesu word in be fairly clear be they not are they clear or do you have doubt no i do believe that paul can overrule god an important first step the realization that paul wa human however paul wa write for a largely gentile audience ye and he wa write and speak for an audience that wa at best very weak in the faith most could not read most be unfamiliar with the hebrew scripture in even the septuagint form paul adapt the message of the bible to a largely uneducated market granted thi market still exist today but do you count yourself a part of it to be weak in the faith be not miss the mark hamartium if you do the best that ymy education allow are you do the best the law wa regard by jew at the time and now a bind on jew but not on gentile there be rule that be bind on all human be the so-called noachic law but they be quite minimal let me make clear that the law be none other than the pentateuch of genesi exodu leviticu number deuteronomy what do jesu say about the law in where do jesu say that the law only apply to jew and that gentile be above the law the issue that the church have to face after jesu death wa what to do about gentile who want to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them do say that the law wa abolish it simply acknowledge that fact that it do apply to gentile who acknowledge thi fact on what basi are we extra-biblical at thi point why not also acknowledge that the bhagavad-gitum be the only relevant text for gentile after all we see in the bible that it wa magu from the east who observe the star-sign of jesu why bother with any text at all why not just follow whatever the church ha to say thu there be no contradiction with mat i do see how you can say thi with a straight face are you a follower of christ or do you follow someone else are you say that the word of jesu only apply to jew a far a i can tell both paul and other jewish christian do continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath thu they continue to obey the law how jewish wa paul after he change hi name from saul the issue wa and be with gentile christian who be not cover by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspect of it who say gentile christian be not cover by the first five book who say that gentile christian be above the ten commandment jesu deal mostly with jew i think we can reasonably assume that mat wa direct to a jewish audience you imply that jesu word be valid only for jew is thi really what you mean to say you do realize that you be gutting rather large portion of the bible when you read jesu word do you ever consider that maybe just maybe jesu be talk to you no matter what ymy race or sex if the hebrew scripture and the gospel account of jesu be only direct to jew why be they translate into english he do interact with gentile a few time the centurion whose slave wa heal and a couple of other the term use to describe the centurion see luke suggest that he wa a god-fearer a gentile who follow god but have not adopt the whole jewish law a paul would call him one who wa weak in the faith he wa commend by jewish elder a a worthy person and jesu accept him a such thi seem to me to indicate that jesu accept the prevail view that gentile need not accept the law which be more important the record word of jesu or indication that you can deduce from the bible wa jesu god only of the jew or god of all humankind of all race and sex however there more involve if you want to compare jesu and paul on the law in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grip with paul apparent rejection of the law and how that relate to jesu commendation of the law at least a i read paul he say that the law serve a purpose that ha be in a certain sense supercede thi be ymy understand of paul compare thi to the word of jesu are you christian or pauline again thi issue be one of the abolition of the law in the middle of hi discussion paul note that he might be understand thi way and assure u that that not what he intend to say rather he see the law a primarily be present to convict person of their sinfulnes but ultimately it an impossible standard and one that ha be supercede by christ again thi be ymy understand of paul did jesu say that the law wa an impossible standard did jesu say that he supercede the law are you christian or pauline paul comment be not the world clearest here and not everyone agree with my read you acknowledge that it be ymy read of paul what do jesu say can you deny that be quite clear in it mean are you christian or pauline but the interest thing to notice be that even thi radical position do not entail an abolition of the law it still remain a an uncompromising standard from which not an iotum or dot may be remove for it purpose of convict of sin it important that it not be relax when do jesu say that the purpose of the law wa conviction of sin however for christian it not the end ultimately we live in faith not law please reread are you christian or pauline jesu interpretation emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial detail are you say that the ten commandment be ceremonial detail paul conclusion be similar while he talk about the law be supercede all of the specific example he gife involve the ceremonial law such a circumcision and the sabbath he be quite concern about maintain moral standard you call observance of the sabbath the day on which the lord rest ceremonial ha circumcision be supercede for christian are you christian or pauline both there be no doubt in my mind about what be sin and what be not at least not in thi case jesu do not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law wa bind on gentile that why i have to cite evidence such a the way jesu deal with the centurion a to general jewish view on thi i be dependent largely on study of pauline theology one by schoep and one whose author i ca come up with at the moment both author be jew also variou christian and non-christian jew have discuss the issue here and in other newsgroup mat be clear that the law be still valid it do not say that it apply to gentile and ye i say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandment be a ceremonial detail when you look at the obligation of gentile similarly circumcision i not sure quite what else i can say on thi subject again it unfortunate the jesu do answer the question directly however we do know what the cent jewish approach wa how jesu deal with at least one gentile and how jesu disciple deal with the issue when it become more acute i refer to act more than paul given that these be all in agreement i do see that there a big problem clh
