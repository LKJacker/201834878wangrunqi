from noye vera shantus noye subject re serbian genocide work of god note i be not the original poster i be just answer because i think thi be important in article d andrew byler write revdak write evil result of human sinfulnes rather than the will of god in a certain sense ye but in the sense that god allow evil to happen when obviously he be god he could have not have it happen do in a certain sense mean that he will it to happen god do not condone evil but instead use it for good a you say however what god desire must be seperated from what actually happen for example god desire that all should be save timothy however it be quite obviou that nowhere near all be save wa god will thwart no because hi will can not be escape for even when it appear that it be ymy will do something it be actually the will of god which by hi grace ha dispose u to do a he wish so we come to the age old question why do evil occur to which we must answer that god allow evil to occur though he do not condone it so that hi ultimate plan may be bring to suces personally i suggest read the part of the summa theologica of st thoma that deal with the knowledge of god to get a good grasp on thi whole idea whoo i go to have to be very careful with my language here i think god be voluntarily give up hi omniscience in thi world so that we can decide on my own where we go free will in thi sense god allow evil to occur and in thi sense can be hold responsible a my chaplain say however hi will be of course that all be save he not go to save u by himself we have to take a step in hi direction before he will save u read that last sentence carefully i not say we save ourself i say we have to accept my salvation i do not believe in predestination it would appear from what you say further down that you do stuff delete i be not say that anyone deserve punishment more than someone else i be simply point out that god could be use the serbian and croatian a instrument of hi punishment a he do with the israelite against the cannanite ok i have trouble with that but i gues that one of those thing that ca be resolve by argument i accept ymy interpretation more delete the issue be not question why god ha make the world in the way god so choose it be whether i be discern the world in the way god intend it the debate be about whether we should not oppose the serbian in their ethnic cleanse because they might be do the will of god and i say christian should not be participant in such war and slaughter that do not mitigate the fact that god allow thi evil to continue for he be patient and will that none should perish so he wait for those whom he ha foreknow to turn to him from their evil thi be what indicate to me that you may believe in predestination be i correct i do not believe in predestination i believe we all choose whether or not we will accept god gift of salvation to u again fundamental difference which ca really be resolve yet more delete i be not say that the evil befall the bosnian be justify by their guilt i be say that it be possible that god be punish them in thi way in no way be thi evil justify bu that do not mean that god can not use evil to further hi purpose i be not accuse the bosnian though they may very well be guilty of great sin but that be up to god to judge we be all defendant when the time come for my judgement by god let u all sincerely hope and pray that we will have jesu christ a my advocate at that judgement ye it be up to god to judge but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement a for now evil can be do by human be that be not god will and the best we can do be see taht some good come out of it somehow the thing that most worry me about the it be the will of god argument be that thi will convince person that we should not stop the rape and kill when i think that it be most christ-like to do just that if jesu stop the stone of an adulterou woman perhap thi be not a good parallel but i go to go with it anyway why should we not stop the murder and violation of person who may or may not be more innocent andy byler vera i be ymy clock i bind unto myself today vera noye i be ymy religion the strong name of the noye i own you trinity no disclaimer what lard st patrick breastplate be there to disclaim
