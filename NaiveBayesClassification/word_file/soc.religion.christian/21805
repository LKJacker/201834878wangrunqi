from torsina who subject islam satanic dear fellow christian i have a dinner last night with a bible study group which i be in we have a discussion about the difference between christianity and islam and i wa shock to hear that my bible study teacher say that mohammad wa indeed a prophet but of satan i say what i do not believe that because i have some moslem friend who be so kind and nice even sometime i feel i wish i could be like them in my point of view they do sin a much a i do how come if they be under satan they could have such personality to tell you the truth i do know much about islam but i know that they believe in god they believe in the day of judgement now i ask you what ymy opinion about islam and it teach important i do not want to discus whether they be save or not i do not want to discus about politic relate to islam i post thi in and in christ my lord smile jesu love you tabut torsina torsina let me start by say that thi be not the right newsgroup for a discussion of islam since there a group for that but i suspect the point ymy teacher wa make wa not specifically about islam indeed it go to be impossible to see what he wa get at within ymy groundrule since the question of whether non-christian be save be at the heart of it the classic christian view which i think most person believe until the last century or so wa that christianity and of course judaism wa the only religion found by god and that all other religion worship false god and come from satan thi be more or le a corollary of another traditional view that no one but christian and possibly jew will be save thi need not mean that there no truth in any other religion nor that all of their member be intentionally satanic after all in order to be an effective snare satanic alternative would have to be attractive thu they might contain all kind of truth wisdom and spiritual insight they would be miss only one thing knowledge of salvation through christ if thi be the background of ymy teacher remark and i suspect it be that mean that a discussion of islam be not necessarily relevant the point be not that there anything intrinsically wrong with it it may teach a fine code of behavior and it practitioner may all be wonderful person but if salvation require be a follower of christ it could still be a satanic invention thi be a reasonable deduction from the classic protestant position christianity say that salvation be a matter of be kind and nice those be good thing and we should encourage them but no one be able to do them enough to be save salvation require christ please forgive me for do thi in protestant term there a catholic equivalent to thi that ha similar implication but in different term a religion may be quite attractive in all visible way but if it do have christ it like a diet that consist of food that look wonderful taste great but be miss some essential food element so that you end up die let me be clear that i be not specifically advocate thi position what i try to do be a usual to clarify issue indeed it be now relatively uncommon for christian to believe that all other religion be satanic most christian regard such belief a an unfortunate vestige of the past thi be part of a general move within christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental god christian now find it hard to believe that god would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual force be at work in the world do thing like create superficially attractive alternative to christianity whether there be actually a sound basi for the shift be a decision that person need to make for themself clh
