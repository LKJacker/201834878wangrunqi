from jhpb joseph h buehler subject re sspx schism here be some material by michael davy on the subject of schism in general and archishop lefebvre in particular he write it around the first part of the two-part article wa on the scandalou activity of archbishop weakland in thi country but i cut all that and i par down the rest to what wa relevant joe buehler schism and disobedience according to st thoma aquina schism consist primarily in a refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the member of the church unite to him on first sight it would appear that whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop a discuss above he must be in a state of objective schism a he ha refuse to submit to the pope on a very grave matter involve hi supreme power of jurisdiction however standard catholic textbook of theology make it clear that while all schism involve disobedience not all act of disobedience be schismatic if thi be so a wa note at the begin of thi article it would mean that the number of american bishop who be not schismatic would not reach double figure the distinction between disobedience and schism be make very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de theologie catholique the article be by father yfe congar who be certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre he explain that schism and disobedience be so similar that they be often confuse father congar write that schism involf a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the church for example luther rejection of the papacy father congar explain that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance do not constitute schism but disobedience the catholic encyclopedium explain that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend to sever himself from the church a far a in him ly it add that not every disobedience be schism in order to posse thi character it must include beside the transgression of the command of the superior a denial of their divine right to command not only do mgr lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command but he affirm repeatedly hi recognition of the pope authority and hi intention of never break away from rome the archbishop make hi attitude clear in the issue of day we pray for the pope every day nothing ha change with the consecration last june we be not sedevacantist we recognize in john paul ius the legitimate pope of the catholic church we do even say that he be a heretical pope we only say that hi modernist action favor heresy intrinsically schismatic the principal argument use by those claim that mgr lefebvre be in schism be that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate be an intrinsically schismatic act a bishop who carry out such a consecration it be claim become ipso facto a schismatic thi be not true if such a consecration be an intrinsically schismatic act it would alway have involve the penalty of excommunication in the code of canon law the offence wa punish only by suspension see canon of the code pope piu xius have raise the penalty to excommunication a a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in china the consecration of these illicit chinese bishop differ radically from the consecration carry out by mgr lefebvre a the profess intention wa to repudiate the authority of the pope that be to deny that he ha the right to govern the church and the illicitly consecrate chinese bishop be give a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishop he ha consecrate claim that they have power of jurisdiction they have be consecrate solely for the purpose of ensure the survival of the society by carry out ordination and also to perform confirmation i do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by mgr lefebvre the consecration of bishop without a papal mandate be far more seriou matter than the ordination of priest a it involf a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belong by divine right to the roman pontiff but the archbishop could argue that the crisi afflict the church could not be more grave and that grave measure be need in response it appear to be take for grant by most of the archbishop critic that he wa excommunicate for the offense of schism and the vatican ha certainly be guilty of foster thi impression there be not so much a a modicum of truth in thi allegation the new code of canon law include a section begin with canon entitle penalty for specific offense de poeni in singula dictum the first part deal with offense against religion and the unity of the church de delicti contra religionem et ecclesia unitatem canon deal with the offense of schism which be evidently together with apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offense against the unity of the church but the archbishop wa not excommunicate under the term of thi canon or indeed under any canon involve an offense against religion or the unity of the church the canon cite in hi excommunication come from the third section of penalty for specific offense which be entitle usurpation of ecclesial function and offense in their exercise de munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpatione degue delicti inii exercendi the canon in question be canon which read a bishop who consecrate someone bishop and the person who receife such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic lata sententia excommunication reserve to the holy see the scandalou attempt to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense of schism be then contrary to both truth and charity a comparable smear under civil a oppose to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involve massive damage an accurate parallel would be to state that a man convict of manslaughter have be convict of first degree murder i must stres that what i have write here be not the dubiou opinion of layman unversed in the intricacy of canon law canon lawyer without the least shred of sympathy for mgr lefebvre have repudiate the charge of schism make against him a totally untenable father patrick yaldrini dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in pari note in the july issue of valeur actuelle that a i have just explain mgr lefebvre wa not excommunicate for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function he add that it be not the consecration of a bishop which constitute schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrate bishop it be thi usurpation of the power of the sovereign pontiff which prove the intention of establish a parallel church cardinal rosalio lara president of the pontifical commission for the authentic interpretation of canon law comment on the consecration in the july issue of la repubblica it would be hard to imagine a more authoritative opinion the cardinal write the act of consecrate a bishop without a papal mandate be not in itself a schismatic act in fact the code that deal with offense be divide into two section one deal with offense against religion and the unity of the church and these be apostasy schism and heresy consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate be on the contrary an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry for example in the case of the consecration carry out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh thuc in and although the archbishop wa excommunicate he wa not consider to have commit a schismatic act because there wa no intention of a breach with the church it be not simply unjust but ludicrou to suggest that in consecrate bishop without a papal mandate archbishop lefebvre have the least intent of establish a schismatic church he be not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic the archbishop consider correctly that the the church be undergo it worst crisi since the arian heresy and that for the good of the church it wa necessary for him to consecrate the fmy bishop to ensure the future of hi society canon law provide for just such a situation and even if one believe that the future of the society could have be guarantee without these consecration the fact that the archbishop believe sincerely that it could not mean a canon law state clearly that he ha not incur excommunication furthermore while the vatican allow such prelate a archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it can not expect catholic to pay the least attention to it sanction against a great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life ha be devote to the service of the church and the salvation of soul dr eric m de saventhem president of the international una voce association be one of the best inform layman in the church and he know the archbishop intimately dr de saventhem like myself ha no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between mgr lefebvre and the holy see during the archbishop lifetime a quotation from a statement by dr de saventhem which wa publish in the february remnant merit careful study in retrospect the road lead to the consecration of june appear more pave with grave roman and unfortunately also papal omission than with lefebvrist obstinancy and from the eye of an inform public thi can not be hide by attempt to present the archbishop act of grave disobedience a an offense against the faith it be say today that mgr lefebvre ha an erroneou concept of tradition if thi be so cardinal ratzinger could not on behalf of the pope have address to the archbishop the follow word in hi letter of july ymy ardent desire to safeguard tradition by procure for it mean to live and prosper testify to ymy attachment to the faith of all time the holy father understand ymy concern and share it
