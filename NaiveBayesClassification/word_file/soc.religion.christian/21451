from nabil nabil ayoub subject re monophysite and mike walker in article my moderator comment chalcedon wa a compromise between two group the alexandrian and antiochene it adopt language that wa intend to be acceptable to moderate in both camp while rule out the extreme i agree that there be extreme that be heretical however in the course of the complex politic of the time it appear that some person get reject who do intend heresy but simply use language that wa not understand or even wa mispresented and some seem not to have joint in the compromise for reason other than doctrine there be group descend from both of the supposedly heretical camp thi post discuss the descendant of the alexandrian there be also a remain nestorian like some of the current so-called monophysite there be reason to believe that the current so-called nestorian be not heretical either they shelter nestoriu from what they saw a unfair treatment but claim they do not adopt hi heresy and in fact seem to follow more moderate representative of the antiochene tradition clh there be a big difference between the statu of what you refer to a alexandrian actually thi include all oriental orthodox church and not only copt and that of nestorian the oriental orthodox church never even shelter eutych the advocator of monophysitism but on the contrary it condemn and still do condemn him and hi heresy that be why the eastren chalcedonian orthodox church hold talk with the oriental non-chalcedonian that start year ago and still continue till today but they have converge on many issue the most imporatant of which be christology i have more detail of the inter-orthodox dialogue in case anyone be interest so i do not see how the alexandrian and the nestorian be in a similar position peace nabil nabil ayoub engine research center dept of mechanical engineering university of wisconsin-madison email ayoub
