from jkjec shazad barla subject iteration of the bible hi i not a religiou guy so dont take thi a some kinda flame thanx in advance i want to know why there be so many different version of the bible there be thi version of the bible i have read about and on the front page it say contain inaccurate datum and inconsistency thanx in advance shaz i not sure quite what you mean by many different version the primary distinction in version you see today be in the style of the translation it pretty unusual to see significant difference in mean there be a few difference in the underlie text that because before print manuscript be copy by hand slight difference result there be enough manuscript around that scholar can do a pretty good job of recreate the original but there be some uncertainty fortunately they be generally at the level of minor difference in word there be something like or place where whole sentence be involve but with recent discovery of older manuscript i do think there much uncertainly about those case a far a i know no christian believe that the proces of copy manuscript or the proces of translate be free of error but i also do think there enough uncertainty in establish the text or translate it that it ha much practical effect whether the bible contain inaccurate datum and inconsistence be a hot topic of debate here many christian deny it some accept it though most would say that the inaccuracy involve be on detail that do affect the faith but thi ha nothing to do with there be multiple version the suppose inconsistence can be find in all the version i surprise to find a reference to thi on the title page though what version be you talk about i be refer to major scholarly translation these be what get reference in post here and elsewhere there have certainly be edition that be to be kind le widely accept thi include everything from reconstruction that combine parallel account into single narration to edition that omit material that the editor object to for some reason or the other the copyright on the bible ha long since expire so there nothing to stop person from make edition that do whatever wierd thing they want however the edition that be widely use be carefully prepare by group of scholar from a variety of background with lot of crosscheck i could imagine one of the lesser-known edition claim to have fix up all inaccurate datum and inconsistency but if so it not any edition that widely use the widely use one leave the text a be weeeeelllllll almost a be it be allege that a few translation have fudge a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistency because translation be not an exact science there be alway go to be difference in opinion over which word be best i afraid clh
