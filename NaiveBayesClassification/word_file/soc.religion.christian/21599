from d andrew byler subject re serbian genocide work of god vera shantus noye write really you may be right but i like proof a far a i know and we however shall be innocent of thi sin and will pray with earnest entreaty and supplication that the creator of all may keep unharmed the number of hi elect st clement bishop of rome letter to the corinthian c ad ignatiu also call theophoru to the church at ephesu in asium which be worthy of all felicitation bless a it be with greatnes by the fullnes of god the father predestine from all eternity for a glory that be last and unchanging unite and choose in true suffer by the will of the father in jesu christ my god st ignatiu bishop of antioch letter to the ephesian addres c ad we say therefore that in substance in concept in orgin and in eminece the ancient and catholic church be alone gather a it do into the unity of the one faith which result from the familiar covenant those already choose those predestine by god who know before the foundation of the world that they would be just st clement patriarch and archbishop of alexandrium miscellany c ad of course the doctrine wa explain more fully later on by st augustine aquina etc but the seed be ther from the begin thi be really confuse to me especially since i still believe that christ jesu die for all of u preknowledge of obstinacy seem like an awfully convolute way to account for a couple of verse but i think you be read it wrong i say those who be not save be not save on account of their own sin it be not because god do not give them sufficient grace for he do do so in hi desire that all man might be save however a only some be save and those who be save be save by the grace of god not by work lest any man should boast the other be damn because of their obstinacy in refuse to heed the call of god they be damn by their own free will and chosing a choice forseen by god in hi cause them to be not predestine but reprobate instead so god use grace like margarine he only spread it where it need and not where it be and so there be the save and the not-saved and nothing in between hmmmm certainly god do not distribute grace evenly if he do no one could have their heart harden or rather harden their heart thu cause god to withdraw hi grace but you be correct the world be divide into those who god know to be save and those god know to be on the road to perdition the key be that god know it and we do not thu no one can boast in complete assurance that they be one of the elect and predestine but no one who be a christian in good standin should doubt their salvation either that show a lack of trust in god be punish after we die you say what we get after we die ha a direct bear on how we live now strange you must admit it be possible anyway why would you want something in the hear and know when you can recieve fold in heaven better to lay up ymy treasure in heaven be what jesu say thi be not to condemn the rich but simply to point out that those who be rich be frequently very evil or immoral so god must give them their bless know a they have choose remeber jesu promise tribulation in thi world and hatred of other because we be christian he do not promise heaven on earth he promise heaven so sin be either punish now or later and not both what if it sort of half-punished be there any grey area in thi doctrine not really unles you do penance here on earth you will have to do it in purgatory a paul point out corinthian those with poorer work though still do with good intention will only be save through fire the damn will of course go into fire immeadiately for whatever good they do wa not for god but for self dead work of course the church gife indulgence ha confession and annointing of the sick to remove sin and the the vestige of sin so there be really little excuse for end up in purgatory it be a last hope for the somewhat lazy and careles a i say above in refer to paul and no comment be take a flame you be one of the more polite person i have talk to over the net andy byler p a for balkan military adventure the old saw about that area be that it produce more history then can be consume locally alexander the great wwi the ottoman empire the byzantine empire by which i refer to stirfe and foreign adventure of them in general the balkan war of the latin-greek war of the etc not a good place to hop into
