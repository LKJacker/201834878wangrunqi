from reedr subject re did he really rise in article reedr write the basic problem with ymy argument be ymy total and complete reliance on the biblical text luke account be highly suspect i would refer you to the hermeneium commentary on act in article atum john atum write even if there wa no independent proof that luke account wa valid i find it strange that you would take the negation of it a truth without any direct historical evidence at least that you mention to back it up the assertion wa make unequivocally that no christian ever sufferred for their faith by believe in the resurrection luke account suggest otherwise and in the absence of direct eyewitness who can claim that luke be mistake then i suggest that thi unequivocal assertion be suspect john the problem here be that you have take one peice of my response without bother to connect it with the other part i have repeatedly note that one need to take the problematic historcity of act and then examine the work of john dominic crossan and burton mack once you have take the time to examine recent development in biblical scholarship i think you will grasp more clearly what i be say i think the original claim may have be somewhat more limit than thi it wa an answer to the claim that the witness could be lie because they be willign to suffer for their belief thu it not necessary to show that no christian ever suffer for believe in the resurrection rather the issue be whether those who witness it do i do agree that the post you respond to show that there can be liberal a well a conservative dogmatism clh certainly thi be an issue a i think the situation in waco show most clearly if all that be require be that person be will to die for a belief for it to be true then surely david koresh be the son of god no the spurriou arguement that the resurrection have to be true for person to be will to die must be put to rest the other problem be that it be so monologocentric even if the resurrection wa a big deal which it do seem to have be for either q thoma or even john to a certain degree there be a lot of other thing which the early christian could have be do together that would have be worth die for it be my belief that even the idea of a mix race community which bring down boundary in the name of koinonium could have be enough for person to be will to die radical communty do that jonestown waco warsaw etc but my original point wa that roman persecution which be the only persecution we have document proof of wa not about whether a carpenter come back from the dead such a claim wa not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind my point be that avoidance of military and civic duty emperor worship would have be much more problematic which ha nothing to do with the resurrection at all when nero use christian a human torch to light up hi dinner party it wa because the believe in a rise savior it wa because they be supposedly involve in incest and cannablism the argument that christian be martyr for the resurrection just can not stand up to critical examination randy
