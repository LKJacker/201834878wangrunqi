from hayesstw steve haye subject re the arrogance of christian in article mhsu melinda hsu write belief that their faith be total truth according to them their belief come from the bible and the bible be the word of god and god be truth thu they know the truth thi stance make it difficult to discus other faith with them and my own hesitation about christianity because they see no other way their way be the but i see their faith arise from a willful choice to believe a particular way that choice be part faith and part reason but it seem to me a choice my discussion with some christian remind me of schoolyard discussion when i wa in grade school a kid would say all policeman be jerk i ask how do you know because my daddy tell me so how do you know you daddy be right he say he alway right well the argument usually stop right there in the end be we all just kid grope for the truth if so do we have the authority to declare all other belief beside my own a false i find thi argument very strange though not unfamiliar an analogy someone use a while back can perhap illustrate it say for example there be person live on a volcanic island and a group of geologist determine that a volcano be imminent they warn the person on the island that they be in danger and should leave a group of person on the island be give the task of warn other of the danger they believe the danger be real but other may not do that mean that the first group be necessarily arrogant in warn other of the danger do it mean that they be say that their belief be correct and all other be false some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance and behave in an arrogant manner but that be a personal idiocyncracy it do not necessarily mean that they be all arrogant steve haye department of missiology editorial department univ of south africa box pretorium south africa internet hayesstw
