from jek subject when be two person marry listowner i have send thi to mr anderson privately post it only if you think it of general interest here be a copy of something i write for another list you may find it relevant a listmember ask what make common-law marriage wrong a common-law marriage be not necessarily wrong in itself there be nothing in the bible old or new testament about get marry by a preacher or by a priest jewish or christian and in fact jewish priest have never have any connection with wed there be a common notion that the marriage be perform by the clergyman in fact the traditional christian view at least in the west be that the bride and groom be the minister of the marriage and that the clergyman be there only a a witnes however the essential ingredient of a marriage be mutual commitment two person be consider to be marry if and only if they have bind themself by mutual promise to live together a husband and wife forsake all other till death do them part the reason why those who have reason to be concern about who be marry to whom have alway insist on some kind of public ceremony be in order that society and the couple themself may be clear about whether a commitment ha be make suppose that we do away with the public ceremony the standard vow etc instead we have a man and a woman settle down to live together after a year or so the man say to the woman hey honey it wa great while it last but i think it time to move on she say what be you talk about he say i be leave you and look for someone prettier and younger she say but you ca we be marry he say what be you talk about we never get marry she say i remember distinctly what you say to me the night we first make love you say my love for you be a deep a the ocean a eternal a the star a long a i live i be your utterly and completely when i lie on my deathbed my last feeble breath will utter ymy name my he say oh that that wa just rhetoric just poetry when a man be in a romantic mood he be bind to say all kind of silly thing like that you must take them literally and that be why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that be a matter of public record the church insist on it because it be her duty among other thing to give moral advice and you can not give a man moral advice about hi relation with a woman if you have no idea who be marry to whom if anybody and vice versa the state insist on it since the state ha a concern with property right with child care and support and therefore need to know who ha make what commitment to whom prospective father-in-law insist on it because they do want their daughter seduce and abandon prospective spouse insist on it because they want to make sure they know whether what they be hear be a real commitment or just poetry and person make vow themself insist on make them formally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their own mind about what it be that they be do and may know themself that thi be not just rhetoric thi be the real thing hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment the church go further and insist that when christian marry a clergyman shall be present at the wed and record the vow on behalf of the church not because it be impossible to have a valid wed without a clergyman but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the christian teach about marriage be and that they be in fact promise to be marry in a christian sense the church also prefer a standard marriage vow and be wary of let couple write their own vow for much the same reason that lawyer prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract certain language ha be repeatedly use in will and one can be sure how the court will interpret it try to say the same thing in ymy own word and you may find that the probate judge interpretation of them be not at all what you intend similarly the church prefer to avoid endles debate about whether you be my main squeeze and i be here for the long haul do in fact cover the same territory a forsake all other and till death do u part thi topic ha come up on the list before is there any topic that ha one listmember wa ask if a couple love each other and be live together be that marriage in the eye of god eventually someone ask in that case what be their statu if they break up is that the moral equivalent of get a divorce are they in a relationship that god forbid either of them to walk out on the original questioner say good grief i never think of that in fact there be reasonable grind for suspect that someone who say we do need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other be try to have it both way to have the advantage of marriage plu the option of change hi mind with a minimum of bother at thi point someone may say none of thi apply to me and my mate we be quite clear on the fact that we have assume a lifelong commitment better or worse forsake all other till death u do part so in my case no ceremony be need to thi my reply would be the reason for require a driver license be to keep dangerou driver off the road what be wrong in itself be not the existence of unlicensed driver but the existence of dangerou driver however test and license driver be an obviou and reasonable mean of pursue the goal of reduce the number of dangerou driver on the road therefore the state rightly make and enforce such law and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from drive without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you be back to the original question we have a listmember who know a couple who have be live together for around year he ask at what point do they stop fornicate and start be marry i answer at the point if any where they both definitely and explicitly accept an obligation to be faithful to each other for better or worse a long a they both live if they have accept such an obligation what be their reason for not be will to declare it in front of say a justice of the peace your jame kiefer
