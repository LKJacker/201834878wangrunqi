from mserv mail server subject re eternal marriage hall hal f lillywhite write in article dhammer pacific david hammerslag write thi paragraph bring to mind a question how do you mormon reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with christ statement that in the ressurection person will neither marry nor be give in marriage luke chapt deletion i think what jesu be say here and it be clearest in matthew and mark account be that marriage will not be perform in the resurrection thi go along with my belief that if a person be to marry at all it must be do on thi earth deletion the problem with thi view be that the topic under discussion in thi passage be marriage that be perform on earth jesu word seem to me to indicate that he regard hi response a the answer to their question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection thi be the case the most straightforward interpretation in my opinion be that marriage do not exist in the next life because those who be raise be of a different nature than what we be now other wise why would jesu offer but be like the angel in heaven a a contrast to the idea of the resurrect marry and be give in marriage we do not have angel-like nature now but someday we shall and when we do my earthly marriage will be irrelevant or at least that what i think jesu be say about the post-resurrection validity of marriage perform on earth ymy mileage may vary mark
