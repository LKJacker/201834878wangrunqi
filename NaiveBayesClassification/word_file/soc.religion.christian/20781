from schnitzi mark schnitziu subject re atheist and hell d andrew byler write mark schnitziu write literal interpreter of the bible will have a problem with thi view since the bible talk about the fire of hell and such thi be something i alway find confuse if all ymy nerve end die with ymy physical body why would flame hurt you how can one wail and gnash tooth with no lung and no tooth one can feel physical pain by have a body which if you know the doctrine of the resurrection of the body be what person will have after the great judgement we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come nicene-constantinopolitan creed you will have both body and soul in hell eventually now thi be get interest i wa raise roman catholic before become an atheist so i have state thi creed you quote nearly every sunday until i wa about for some reason i alway take the in thi statement to mean the resurrection of the soul but i gues resurrection do strictly mean the raise of the physical body i have some question on thi point i alway think that christian believe the descent into hell wa pretty much immediate and that there be person burn in hell right now you seem to be imply that it will not occur until after the great judgement which i read a mean the proverbial judgment day i wa alway a little confuse on thi point even when i wa with the church maybe someone can clear it up for me where will my soul which by the way i do believe in exist until that time will the new body i will have be create out of the same atom that my body now be make of or will it be build from scratch my physical body now be susceptible to age etc so i gues my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be torture for all eternity since i will have a physical body i assume it will need a physical place to exist in where be thi hell in the center of the earth do you think we could find it if we dig mark schnitziu schnitzi univ of central florida there be not complete agreement on the detail of the afterlife i think the most common view be that final disposition do not occur until a final judgement which be still in the future in the meantime some believe that person sleep until the final resurrection or because god be above time pa directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occur while other believe that soul have a disembody pre-resurrection existence until then there be probably other alternative that i omit the new body be generally conceive of be implement in a different technology than the current one one which be not mortal paul talk about the mortal be raise to immortality and jesu resurrect body which be the first example clearly wa not subject to the same kind of limitation a our it be assume that there be enough similarity that person will recognize each other but i do think most person claim to know the detail i do think i say it the same atom i assume there would be some analog of a physical place but i would expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky i suspect that it in another dimension outside thi physical world or whatever but again we have little in the way of detail clh
