from gerry palo subject re portland earthquake austin c archer archau write i be interest in view about the non-event of may seriously how can a christian discriminate between message from god which be to be take seriously and those which be spuriou is there a useful heuristic which would help u avoid embrace message which by their non-fulfillment be prove to be false thu cause the name of christ to be place in disrepute is thi a problem at all it be possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision but that he interpret the scale of time and space accord to hi material con sciousnes translate the supersensible perception of a plane above that of time and space into an immediate worldly context and get it wrong not that he do it rationally but rather that unconsciously the perception become clothe in material image instead of remain in the realm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound thi difficulty of translate prophetic vision into a concrete when and where ha alway be difficult even for the prophet of old that be why their prophecy be so often subject to multiple interpretation likewise the apostle seem to feel that the return of the lord wa to be very soon in the sense of perhap the same generation yet the mean of very soon ha prove to be different than they could grasp prophetic vision tend to telescope time so that thing that be far off appear to be very close another possibility be that the vision wa one of a real event prepare to happen again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which wa thwart by other force include possibly an act of divine mercy there be many concrete prophecy be make these day by devout and sincere and sober christian and other too it seem that great come event be really cast their shadow before their arrival in these apocalyptic time the variou prediction i talk about those that appear to be sincere and sober be hard to accept yet hard to ignore com pletely one ha the feel something be about to start to get ready to begin to commence to happen we be live a the chinese say go in interest time a for how to discriminate the bible do help much there be an old testament passage i forget where it be that say you will know whether a prophet be true by whether or not hi prophecy come to pa that help eliminate the failure after the fact but in the case of an earth quake it be small comfort it seem to me that all prophecy that give specific time and place and event should be suspect not in that they be necessarily false but in the sense state above that all such vision be subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the plane of earthly time and space for what it be worth rudolf steiner once wa ask whether a modern initiate could see into the future and predict come event hi answer wa that it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active partus cipation in them include proclaim what he saw if thi be in fact a spiritual law then the answer to ymy question about how to discriminate be that the one who make such prophecy be probably violate that law knowingly or unknowingly and a such hi message should be consider a priorus to be dubiou i would expect that those capable of make true prediction and give accurate expression to them would not do so in the way that the prophet of the oregon earthquake do however i can sympathize with the person who publish the prophecy given the same overwhelm experience that he apparently have i too might feel impel and even commission by god to tell my fellow human be about what i have see gerry palo do any of my church historian reader know whether there any more prophecy now than there ha be in the past i do get that impression clh
