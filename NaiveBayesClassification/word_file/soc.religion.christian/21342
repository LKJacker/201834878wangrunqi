from rexlex subject re athiest and hell in article gerry palo write between adam and eve and golgotha the whole proces of the fall of man occur thi involve a gradual dim of consciousnes of the spiritual world thi wa precisely my point from a theological bend those who live immediately after the flood such a noah ham hi son cush and hi son nimrod have a much stronger appreciation of divine wrath they also have a stronger understand of the true god in fact thi immediacy wa a cause of hardship for some so much so that atla who be see with heaven rest on hi shoulder but thi be not merely the physical heaven that he be lift it be to put god and the strict spirituality of hi law at a distance and thu he become the elevator of the heaven thi god make man able to feel a if heaven be afar off and a if either the god of heaven could not see through the dark cloud or do not regard with displeasure the breaker of hi law it be interest to see that it wa that wa title emancipator or deliverer or phoroneu it wa nimrod who invade the patriarchal system and abridge the liberty of mankind yet wa worship for have give many benefit he wa a deliverer all right but not a we think of christ a a deliverer one deliver from a consciou feel of god wrath the other actually perform a delivery from god wrath and it be up to u to accept it a true the question of what happen to human be who die before christ be an ever present one with christian i be not ready to consign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation i do see the problem from the time of adam those who look forward to the come anointed one and put their faith in the fact that it wa god who wa to do the provision be account a righteou but up to the crucifixion their sin be only cover not take away therefore the dispensation of the church view the accountability of sin the same but see it a a complete action rom make it clear that it ha alway be salvation vium faith and nothing else it be possible to experience eternity in a pass moment the relationship of eternity to duration be not simply one of indefinitely extend condition of greenwich mean time i understand what you try to convey but i do think i lay hold of it because the scripture do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of say the church rule with christ jn tell u what eternal life be exactly a you be correct that it be much more than non-cessation of consciousnes it wa also a standard belief among many people that even the righteou be lose it depend upon ymy def of lose the elect be lose only in time a outside of time they have be choose from the foundation of the world existentially we be all bear lose but the righteou be in christ and therefore never assuredly lose it would be interest to share in the result of ymy study of ancient person idea of life after death maybe thi summer i could find time to put together a paper on it i simply have to buy more book for myself and these older book be very expensive either that or countles trip to the oriental museum mankind fell into mist and darknes and at the turn point of time a new light enter into the world the light still grow and we be develop the eye with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under stand ly before u my new vision and understand be still very feeble but it contain something new that will grow in time to embrace that which be old and much more a well could agree with you more my understand of say eschatology be clearly clearer than that of say isaiah but that be not what i wa refer to at thi point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insight that have lead me to my view on thi subject the way you refer to it a doctrine put a modern intellectual color on it i think it wa much le abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete a teach that strike much closer to home than my doctrine or teach today can be receive no i understand it a you have say thi wa my point i be not so ready to attribute widespread notion in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they be pass on the question be to what extent do they reflect real perception and experience ah thi be it thi be the big question however i would say again i think that the best lie be one that ha an appreciable amount of truth to it look at satan twist of god word when he coerce eve that be a very interest study the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different person idea of the time immediately after death testify to the presence of an underlie reality ye that be my point but it be a two edge sword for some do not want the underlie reality to be reveal they be not know a mystery religion for no reason there wa the public side of them and there wa the private side that wa so protect that the initiate to an oath of death if they reveal that private side that be why it be so hard to bring their teach to light the mystery of iniquity that we find in the bible correlate to thi i think the primary object of the mystery wa to introduce privately little by little under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath what it would not have be safe to openly profes wa the true religion case in point today might be the mason just a note that they too worship osiri in egypt who can be trace to nimrod the husband son on the other hand there be one notion firmly embed in christianity that originate most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human be consist essentially of soul only and that the soul be create at birth wa consciously adopt from aristotle whose idea dominate christian think for fifteen hundred year and still do today no i disagree with you here gerry i know what you allude to in that the church primarily the rcc do endorse aristotelian philosophy into their worldview but i would disagree with you that it originate in greece if you be a student of history you will come to see that much of what greece come to expound to the world a their original wa just an adulteration of that which they have take from conquer country the soul be clearly mention and discuss at length in the egyptian religion a wa the unity of god and also the trinity of god see if you can find wilkinson egyptian he really do a number on what the greek do to what they pilfer from the egyptian he wa at once the father of modern think and at the same time live during that darken time when the perception of my eternal spiritual be have grow dim i not knock aristotle or plato or any other greek thinker it just that there be nothing new under the sun indeed i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation be a real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment after the end of a single earthly life be not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and i think that be why the early creed be couch in term that do not try to spell it out each age ha it own focu of theology the early church struggle with the trinitarian formulation the reformation deal with authority today eschatology ha have much study the early creed do not spell these thing out in detail because they be the topic of concern there wa insufficient wisdom accumulate they do have the exegetical tool that we have today also each age seem to have an air of revelation to it one age ha a well tend and cultivate garden in which a particular doctrine be give growth it would be natural for the end of time to have the garden appropriate for the growth of eschatology would it tangent never end tangent rex
