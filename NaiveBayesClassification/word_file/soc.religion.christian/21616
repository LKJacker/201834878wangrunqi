from swf stan friesen subject re major view of the trinity in article you write i fear orthodox theologian have be overly in love with paradox to the extent that well-meaning person think they just flat-out confuse there no problem with thing be both and if the be different part of the but they in some way different aspect mode or whatever of one god if you accept economic trinitarianism it possible that you do have any substantive difference with the standard view is it possible that you just do find the neo-platonic explanation illuminate clh i would put it stronger than that i consider it nonsense simply put i do not see any way that a platonic essence could have any real existance essence in the platonic sense do not have any referent a far a i can tell it be just an imaginary concept invent to provide an explanation for thing better explain in other way so to attribute an to god be to attribute to him something that do not exist thu the orthodox platonic formulation seem to leave the unity of god in limbo since it be base on a non-existant thu fail to avoid the very problem it wa suppose to addres thu to me the unity of god must be primary and the triality must be secondary must be modal or aspectual relate to role or to mode of interaction since otherwise there be no mean to say god be one sarima formerly tdatirv sarima or i think one can read augustine a say something consistent with ymy comment hi de trinitate which ha be very influential in the west define the distinction among the person relationally you probably at one extreme of orthodox view but i not sure ymy view be necessary incompatible with the trinity clh
