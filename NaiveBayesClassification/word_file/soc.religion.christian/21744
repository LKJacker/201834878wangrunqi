from mserv mail server subject christian homosexuality part of note i be break thi reply into part due to length ml michael siemon write in article mserv someone name mark write ml michael siemon write homosexual christian have indeed check out these verse some of them be use against u only through incredibly perverse interpretation other simply do not addres the issue i can see that some of the above verse do not clearly addres the issue there be exactly zero verse that clearly addres the issue i agree that there be no verse that have go unchallenged by gay right activist but if there be zero verse that addres the issue do that mean that there be also no verse that clearly support ymy case are you sure you want to say that there be zero verse that clearly addres the issue however a couple of them seem a though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretation in order to be see a condemn homosexuality the kind of interpretation i see a incredibly perverse be that apply to the story of sodom a if it be a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christian cite the bible in such a context should be presume to have at least read the story it amount to slander a charge that homosexuality rape to use that against u the story in genesi tell of the citizen of sodom demand an opportunity to know the two man who be lot guest the fact that the sodomite become angry when lot offer them hi daughter could be see a indicate that they be interest only in homosexual intercourse ye what they want wa rape homosexual rape and everybody agree that that be wrong some christian believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire wa just a sinful a the rape aspect of their desire the passage do not say what it wa that so offend god whether it wa the homosexuality or the intend rape or both but i believe that it be only fair to consider all the possible alternative in the light of relate scripture i do not believe that those who believe god wa offend by both the homosexuality and the rape be try to say that homosexuality be itself a form of rape you seem to take the view that the only sin describe in gen be in the fact that the sodomite want to commit rape and that it be unfair to stigmatize their homosexuality by associate it with the sin of rape i can see how you might reach such a conclusion if you start from the conclusion that there be nothing wrong with homosexuality but then again we not suppose to start from my conclusion because that circular reason if god be in fact oppose to homosexual intercourse in general then the more probably interpretation be that he wa at least a offend by the sodomite blatant homosexuality a he wa by their intent to commit rape later on i will document why i believe the old testament portray god a one who despise any homosexual intercourse even if both partner be consent adult do not be deceive neither fornicator nor idolator nor adulterer nor effeminate nor homosexual nor thieve nor the covetou nor drunkard nor reviler nor swindler shall inherit the kingdom of god and such be some of you i cor the moderator adequately discus the circularity of ymy use of porneium in thi the moderator find my proposal to be circular in that he regard the church a the proper authority for determine what kind of marriage would be legitimate and thu the church refusal to recognize pervert marriage wa circular reason my question however have nothing to do with the church ordain new kind of marriage and so hi argument wa something of a straw man in term of my original question the precise of porneium be really important unles you be try to argue that the bible do really condemn extramarital sex i not sure the moderator wa try to do that in any case i think both you and the moderator have miss the point here when jesu wa ask about divorce he reply have you not read that he who create them from the begin make them male and female and say thi cause a man shall leave hi father and mother and shall cleave to hi wife and the two shall become one flesh consequently they be no longer two but one flesh what therefore god ha join together let no man separate mt i read here that the sexual union of a man male and hi wife female be a divinely-ordained union in other word the institution of heterosexual marriage be something ordain and establish by god not by man and not by the church but by god man be not suppose to dissolve thi union in jesu word because it be not something create by man thi be not circular reason thi be just read god word i read in the bible that god ordain the union of male and female i do not read of any similar divinely-ordained union of two male or two female granted there have be uninspired man who have ordain alternative union be caligula report to have marry hi horse but the only union that jesu refer to a what god ha join together be the heterosexual union of a man and hi wife pardon me for mention caligula i know that probably inflammatory and i should save it for the discussion on bestiality in part of thi post please hold off on pass judgement on me until you have read that section of my reply anyway my original question wa not whether we should translate porneium in a way that condemn only a select few kind of extramarital sex my question wa give that heterosexual marriage be the only union describe by the bible a divinely-ordained and give a biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage be homosexual intercourse sinful of course i see now that first we need to ask whether the bible really condemn sex outside of marriage you seem to be try to argue that only certain kind of extramarital sex and other sin be really wrong i think we can all agree with paul that there be some kind of activity that could be name by fornication or theft or covet or revile or drunkennes which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bind of those category however and the very fact that they be argue over suggest that not only be the matter not at all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician have no interest in making them clear leave matter rather to my spirit-led decision with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that ha dominate christian discussion of all these area alternatively it may be that the definition of such term a porneium and all the rest wa in paul day what we would call a faq the law a the tutor appoint by god to lead u to christ have just spend some sixteen century drum into the head of god person the idea that thing like homosexual intercourse be abomination that deserve punishment by death perhap paul do go into detail on what porneium c be because after year he consider the question to have be deal with already perhap the reason god apostle and prophet do not devote a great deal of time define a distinct new testament sexuality wa because he do not intend any significant change in the sexuality he have already establish by the law i discus the law and homosexuality in greater detail below but i just want to point out that the new testament failure to develop a detail new standard of sexuality be not necessarily evidence that god do not care about sexual conduct especially after year of put person to death for practice homosexuality homosexual behavior be no different i and the other gay christian i know be adamant in condemn rape heterosexual or homosexual and child molestation heterosexual or homosexual and even the possibly harmles but obsessive kind of sex heterosexual or homosexual that would stand condemn by paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite may i mildly suggest that what paul do in hi letter that you want to use be perhap a good guide to hi mean be free to do anything you say ye but not everything be for my good no doubt i be free to do anything but i for one will not let anything make free with me cor which be a restatement that we must have no other god before god a commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wish to break some person be indeed involve in obsessively drive mode of sexual behavior it be just a wrong though slightly le incendiary so it a secondary argument from the contingent to equate homosexuality with such behavior a to equate it with the rape of god messenger and how do you define an obsessively drive mode of sexual behavior how do you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex drife is the desire to have sinful sex an obsessively drive mode of behavior i think you see that thi be circular reason why be it define a sinful because it be obsessive what make it obsessive the fact that the person be drive to seek it even though it sinful or be it obsessive because it be a desire for that which society condemn once again that circular why be it define a obsessive because the person want it even though society condemn it why do society condemn it because it be obsessive you seem to be try to limit the bible condemnation of porneium to only pervert sex act but i do think you can really define pervert without fall into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of what then be paul condemn when he declare that fornicator shall not enter the kindgom of heaven i wo deal with the exegesi of leviticu except very tangentially fundamentally you be exhibit the same circularity here a in ymy assumption that you know what porneium mean i think you misunderstand me i wa not try to make an argument on some technical definition of porneium i wa raise the issue of the sinfulnes of extramarital sex and the lack of any scriptural evidence of a homosexual counterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couple there be plenty of law prohibit sexual behavior to be find in leviticu most of which christian ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just assume that they know which one be moral and which one be ritual well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean v unlcean a category in an awful lot of society we have them too but bury pretty deep and i can not see any grind for distinguish these bite of leviticu from the ritual law which no christian i know feel apply to u i dead seriou here when person start go on a they do in thi matter about how repulsive and unnatural my act be and what do they know about it huh it be a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcation a the american prejudice against eat insect please remember what you just say here for when we discus bestiality in part on what basi other than assume ymy conclusion can you say that the law against male-male intercourse in leviticu be not a part of the ritual law i be glad you ask would you agree that if god condemn homosexual intercourse even among those who be not under the law of mosis then thi would show that god condemnation of homosexual act go beyond the ritual law if i can show you from scripture that god punish the homosexual behavior of person who be not under the law of mosis would you agree that god definition of homosexual intercourse a an abomination be not limit to just the ritual law and those who be under the law i be have a private email discussion with a day adventist on the subject of the sabbath and my main point against a christian sabbath-keeping requirement ha be that nowhere in scripture do god command gentile to rest on the sabbath nor do he ever condemn gentile for fail to rest on the sabbath thi illustrate the difference between universal requirement such a thou shalt not kill and requirement that be merely part of the temporary jews-only law of mosis such a the sabbath the point you be try to make be that you think the classification of homosexual intercourse a an abomination be just a part of the temporary jews-only law of mosis i on the other hand believe that it wa label by god a an abomination for gentile a well a jew and that he punish those guilty of thi behavior by death or exile here why back in genesi god promise to give abraham all the land that wa then in the possession of the amorite kinda hard on the amorite do you think but in verse we have a clue that thi might not be a unjust a it sound it seem god be go to postpone thi takeover for quite a while because the iniquity of the amorite be not yet complete remember thi be all long before there wa a ritual law what then wa the iniquity the amorite wa commit that when complete would justify hi be cast out of hi own land kill go back and look at lev again verse list a variety of sin include child sacrifice incest homosexuality and bestiality beginning in verse god start say do not defile yourself by any of these thing for thing the nation which i be cast out before you have for the land ha become defile therefore i have visit it punishment upon it so the land ha spew out it inhabitant for whoever do any of these abomination those person who do so shall be cut off from among their person notice that god say the gentile nation who be not under the ritual law of mosis be about to be punish because they have defile themself and their land by commit abomination that include incest bestiality and homosexuality flip ahead two chapter to lev and you will find these same abomination list and thi time god decree the death penalty on anyone involve in any of these thing include specifically a man lie with another man a one ly with a woman lv their bloodguiltines wa upon them mean that in god eye they deserve to die for have do such thing according to lev even the alien non-jew who sojourn among you wa to refrain from these practice on penalty of be cut off by god from among their person under the circumstance i believe it would be very difficult to support the claim that in the old testament god object only to the intend rape and not the homosexuality in sodom since god take the trouble to specifically list sex between two consent man a one of the reason for wipe out the canaanite nation not homosexual rape mind you but plain voluntary gay sex i say god wa not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior even by those who have nothing to do with the mosaic covenant for those christian who do think that some part of leviticu can be law for christian while other be not even to be think about it be incumbent on you in every case handle on it own merit to determine why you pick one and ignore another according to ius tim all scripture be inspire by god and be profitable for teach reproof correction and train in righteousnes thu i believe that even though we gentile christian be not under the law we can learn from study it if a certain action be define a a sin because it be a violation of the law then it be a sin only for those who be under the law for example in the case of sabbath-keeping where god reveal that certain action be abomination even for those who be not under the law then i conclude that god objection to the practice be not base on whether or not a person be under the law but on the sinfulnes of the act itself in the case of homosexuality homosexual intercourse be define by god a a defile abomination for gentile a well a jew for those who be not under the law a well a for those who be thu i be not at all try to say that gentile christian have any obligation to keep any part of the law i be simply say that god refer to homosexuality a a sin even for those who be not obligate to keep the law if thi be so then i do not think we can appeal to my exemption from the law a valid grind for legitimize a practice god ha declare a bloodguilty abomination that defile both jew and gentile continue in part mark
