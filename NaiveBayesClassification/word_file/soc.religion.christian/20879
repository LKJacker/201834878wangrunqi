from stephen stephen montgomery-smith subject re latest on branch davidian in aaron scott aaron write in article conditt paul conditt write i think it really sad that so many person put their faith in a mere man even if he do claim to be the son of god a prophet i pose a question here that get me think what distinguish true religion from cult i speak generally here not specifially about christianity jerry falwell wa on good morning america on tuesday ostensibly to answer thi question basically he say that true religion follow a message wherea a cult follow a person but then christianity be a cult because the message of christianity is the person of jesu so what distinguish for example the branch davidian cult from the presbyterian church doctrinal difference do answer the question imho so do use them a an answer a far a i can see one of the big difference between davidian and christian be in who they follow i have sometime try to put myself in the foot of one of jesu disciple basically they give up a lot career possibly family and well a whole bunch to follow jesu so what be the difference it be quite plain jesu wa good and david koresh wa not the problem be i think be that we try to legislate what be good and what be bad in term of principle for instance there be thousand of law in the govern what be legal and what be not often it be hard to bring person to justice because it be not possible to find a legal way to do it if only we could trust judge to be just then we could tell them to administer justice fairly and justice would be follow but since judge do alway get it right we have a complicate system involve precedent and bunch of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect the justice of man into something perfect but what i hear about the justice system in the tell me that quite the opposite be true there be also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material be present so we might consider a rant christian to be bad but an eloquent person from another religion to be good thi go along with the american desire to protect the constitution at all cost even if it allow person to do bad thing i think that it be the message that be important if a man be present a false message even if he be ever ever so mild mannered then that man be perform a tremendou disservice i know that i be ramble here i gues that what i be try to say be that we should be look for principle that tell u why the davidian get it wrong it be not wrong to follow and worship a person but it be important to choose the right person it be simple choose jesu and you get it right choose anyone else and you get it wrong why because jesu be the beget son of god and nobody else be jesu wa without sin and nobody else wa stephen
