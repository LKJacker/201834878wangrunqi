from gideon gideon king subject should christian fight justifiable war i post thi a couple of week ago and it do seem to have appear on the newsgroup and i have have a reply from the moderator we be have intermittent problem with my mail at the time please excuse me if you have see thi before should christian fight last week alastair post some question about fight and whether there be such thing a justifiable war i have start look into these thing and have jot down my find a i go i have answer all hi question yet and i know what i have here be on a slightly different tack but possibly i be able to get into it more deeply later and post some more info soon my duty to my neighbmy do good to all man gal love my neighbmy a ourself matt act the part of the good samaritan luke toward any who may be in trouble we will therefore render every possible assistance to an injure man and therefore should not be part of any organisation which cause person harm even medical corp of the army etc christian be by faith citizen of the commonwealth of israel ephesian and also recognise that god rule in the kingdom of man and therefore we should not be take part in any of the struggle of those nation which we be not part of due to my faith we be to be stranger and pilgrim amongst the nation so we be just pass through and not part of any nation or any national aspiration thi can also be apply to politic etc but that another story we be not suppose to strive or resist evil even suffer yourself to be defraud it be therefore incosistent for u to strive to assist in preserve a state which christ will destroy when he return to set up god kingdom my duty to the state render therefore unto caesar the thing which be caesar and unto god the thing which be god luke let every soul be subject unto the higher power for there be no power but of god the power that be be ordain of god whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god rom submit yourself to every ordinance of man for the lord sake whether it be to king a supreme for so be the will of god that with well do ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish man pet these scripture make it clear that submission to the power that be be a divine command but it be equally clear from act that when any ordinance of man run counter to god law we must refuse submission to it the reason for thi be that we be god bond servant and hi service be my life task an example of the type of thing be in col where bondservant be to work heartily a unto the lord so also we should work a if my bos wa god pressed down shake together and run over oop a bite of a side track there in the contest between the nation we be on god side a side that be not fight in the battle but be testify to the truth when we believe in god and embrace hi promise we become fellow citizen with the saint and of the household of god and be no longer interest in association of the world think of thi in relation to union etc a well paul tell u to lay aside every weight that we may run the race that be set before u and if we be wise we will discard any association which would retard my progress thou therefore endure hardnes a a good soldier of jesu christ no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affair of thi life that he may please him who hath choose him to be a soldier tim one of these entanglement he warn about be be ye not unequally yoke together with unbeliever one of the obviou application of thi be marriage with unbeliever but it also cover thing like busines partnership and any other position where we may form a close association with any person or person not believe the truth about god in thi case the army the principle come from deut remember that a well a them be different animal of different strength one wa clean and one unclean under the law these idea be strongly stress in cor i suggest you read thi the yoke also ha another aspect that of servitude and jesu say take my yoke upon you so we be then yoke with christ and can not be yoke with unbeliever we have already see that we be bondservant of christ and paul say become not ye the bondservant of man cor rv an example from the old testament the question be ask in chr shouldest thou help the ungodly the situation here be a good example of what happen when you be yoke together with unbeliever jehoshaphat wa lucky to escape with hi life here be the fact he have make an affinity with ahab who have sell himself to work wickednes before the lord king when ask by ahab to form a military alliance he have agree and say i be a thou art my person a thy person king an unequal yoke he sttod firm in refuse the advice of the false prophet and insist on hear the prophet of the lord try to do the right thing he find that he wa yoke and therefore could break away from the evil association he have make god say to u come out from among them and be ye separate and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and ye shall be my son and daughter cor thi be more or le what i have find out so far i still look into it a i do think i answer all the question raise by alastair yet here a summary and a few thing to think about the christian in under command obedience to thi command be an essential factor in hi relationship with christ john total dedication to thi course of action be require roman disobedience compromise the close relationship between christ and hi follower pet we be to be separate to god rom thi involf a master-servant relationship rom no man can serve two master matt all that be in the be lust and pride quite oppose to go john christ kingdom be not of thi world not worldly in nature if it wa hi servant would fight to deliver him if christ be my master and he wa not deliver by hi servant because hi kingdom wa not of thi world then hi servant can not possibly fight for another master stranger and pilgrim have no right and we can not swear allegiance to anyone but god the servant of the lord must not war but be gentle to all tim thi do not just apply to war but also to avoid strife throughout my life there be a war to be wag not with man weapon cor but with god armmy i probably post some more when i have time to look into thing a bite further gideon king phone university of otago fax department of computer science e-mail gideon box dunedin next mail prefer new zealand
