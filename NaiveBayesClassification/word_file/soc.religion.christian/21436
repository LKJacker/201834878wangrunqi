from mserv mail server subject re homosexual issue in christianity ml michael siemon write in whitsebd bryan whitsell write any one who think that homosexuality and christianity be compatible should check out roman i corinthian i timothy jude ius peter gen lev to name a few of the verse that pertain to homosexuality homosexual christian have indeed check out these verse some of them be use against u only through incredibly perverse interpretation other simply do not addres the issue i can see that some of the above verse do not clearly addres the issue however a couple of them seem a though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretation in order to be see a condemn homosexuality do not be deceive neither fornicator nor idolator nor adulterer nor effeminate nor homosexual nor thieve nor the covetou nor drunkard nor reviler nor swindler shall inherit the kingdom of god and such be some of you i cor would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seem to say fornicator will not inherit the kingdom of god how do thi apply to homosexual i understand fornication to be sex outside of marriage is thi an accurate definition is there any such thing a same-sex marriage in the bible my understand ha alway be that the new testament bless sexual intercourse only between a husband and hi wife i be however will to listen to scriptural evidence to the contrary you shall not lie with a male a one ly with a female it be an abomination also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defile with it nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it it be a perversion lev i notice that the verse forbid bestiality immediately follow the verse prohibit what appear to be homosexual intercourse i know of no new testament passage that clearly condemn or even mention intercourse with animal do those who argue for the legitimacy of homosexual intercourse believe that the bible condemn bestiality a a perversion and if so why that be what verse would you cite to prove that bestiality wa pervert and sinful could the verse you cite be refute by interpret them differently can one be a christian zoophile by the way i myself be subject to sexual desire that i do not choose to have and that many person would regard a pervert and sinful so please understand that i be not ask these question out of an antipathy toward my fellow person of alternative orientation i do believe however that one should read the bible with an attitude of what be the bible try to say and not what do i want the bible to say i choose not to give in to my pervert sexual desire because i believe the bible try to tell me whether i like it or not that such thing be sin it be frustrate at time and i have have day where it really get me down but i do blame god for thi i blame the sin itself mark there some ambiguity about the mean of the word in the passage you quote both liberal and conservative source seem to agree that homosexual be not the general term for homosexual but be likely to have a mean like homosexual prostitute that do mean that i think all the biblical evidence vanish but the nature of the evidence be such that you ca just quote one verse and solve thing i think ymy argument from fornication be circular why be homosexuality wrong because it fornication why be it fornication because they not marry why be they marry because the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony why do the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony because homosexuality be wrong in order to break the circle there get to be some other reason to think homosexuality be wrong clh
