from family magazine sysop subject the empty tomb the empty tomb can we trust it by the late wilbur m smith when jesu wa on earth he make an amaze prediction about himself and frequently repeat it let me quote it for you behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betray unto the chief priest and unto the scribe and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentile to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again matthew wholly different from the normal experience of man jesu who have never do anything worthy of death even deserve reproval know he would die before he wa year of age he know the very city where he would die he know that the religiou leader of hi own race would condemn him to death he know that one of hi own would betray him he know that before hi actual death take place he would be mock and scourge he know exactly how he would die by crucifixion all thi be in itself remarkable but more amaze than the minute particular of hi foreknowledge wa what he predict would follow shortly after he wa bury that he would rise again he even designate the time on the third day but since it be on thi central fact the death and resurrec tion of jesu christ that the whole truth or untruth of chri tianity turn let u examine it more closely the body of jesu wa embalm in long sheet of cloth between the layer of which a great abundance of spice and ointment wa distribute the body wa place in a tomb which have never before be use and a great stone wa roll against the entrance the jewish authority fully aware that jesu have predict he would rise again have the stone officially seal and on saturday place a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciple from carry away the body early sunday morning some of the woman who be faithful follower of christ go out to the tomb to further anoint the body to their utter astonishment they find the stone roll away the body go they rush back to tell the disciple shortly two of jesu friend peter and john utterly skeptical about the whole affair come and find the tomb empty just a the woman have say even the guard come hurry into the city to tell the sanhedrin that have hire them to guard the tomb that the body wa go matthew how do thi tomb become empty one of the most famou new testament scholar in america professor of new testament literature in a large theological seminary write to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb become empty and write it in a letter not mark by bitternes or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb become empty than he could explain how santum clau come down the chimney at christma time but he do realize that santum clause never do come down any chimney at christma time because there never wa a santum clau and there be a jesu he die he wa bury in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body wa go those be fact of history no one can escape the responsi bility of come to some conclusion about what really happen by mention a myth we all abandon before we be eight year old another professor dr kirsopp lake of harvard university try to explain the empty tomb by say what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism ha venture to adopt that the woman go to the wrong tomb the fact be these first so far a we know there wa no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have go second it be contrary to all similar experience for three or more person to forget the place where they have bury their dearest love one within le than three day even if the woman do mi the tomb when peter and john come do they too go to the wrong tomb third be the soldier guard the wrong tomb there be of course a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself now when they be go behold some of the watch come into the city and show unto the chief priest all the thing that be do and when they be assemble with the leader and have take counsel they give large money unto the soldier saying say ye hi disciple come by night and steal him away while we sleep and if thi come to the governor ear we will persuade him and secure you so they take the money and do a they be teach and thi say be com monly report among the jew until thi day matthew thi be a good illustration of many later attempt to escape the fact that the tomb wa empty you will notice at once that the chief priest and the elder never question but that the tomb wa empty they never even go out to see if what the guard have report wa true they know it wa true another fact about thi story make it ridiculou to maintain that the tomb wa empty the soldier be tell to say that jesu disciple come and steal the body away while they the soldier be asleep how could they know what wa go on while they be asleep obviously such testimony would be valueles in any court even aside from the shallownes and sordidnes that make u reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciple compel u to believe they do not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesu first a professor heffern point out the leader of judaism in jerusalem who have put the lord jesu to death have nothing to offer to contradict these disciple a they continue to preach jesu and hi resurrection because all jerusalem know the tomb wa empty if there have be trickery here sooner or later it would have be suspect then prove second surely one of the disciple even most of them would have confess the fraud under the terrific persecution they undergo it may be possible to live a lie but man seldom die for a lie and most of these man do the result ultimately would have be that the message that christ have rise would have suffer the fate of all such unfounded story it would have lose it power instead thi truth sweep the world close pagan temple win million of disciple bring hope to a despair humanity wa the very foundation truth of the early church and be today a believable and a freshly gloriou a ever but not only do jesu come alive again he do not disappear to leave the disciple speculate through all the subsequent day a to what have happen to him instead he appear to them literally visibly frequently he appear to the woman at the tomb on resurrection morning matthew later that day to mary magdalene alone john and to simon peter also alone luke in the afternoon he walk with two of hi follower toward emmau luke and that night he appear to ten of the apostle gather together in an upper room at jerusalem mark luke etc a week later he appear to all eleven of the apostle probably at the same place john once he wa see by above brother on a mountain in galilee i corinthian and finally to the apostle just before hi ascension mark luke act a with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor ically record appearance all kind of theory have be propose attempt to deny their literalnes but these theory be unreasonable without support evidence none ha ever win the unanimou approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearance moreover while it be true we be live in an age when may of my lead scientist and agnostic and many of my philosopher be antisuperanaturalistic let u not forget that some of the greatest thinker of the age have firmly believe in thi great miracle increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of amherst mark hopkin president of william john witherspoon president of princeton these man and countles other have believe it but suppose christ do rise from the dead what of it what ha it to do with my life what ha it to do with ymy life just thi it seal with certitude the teach of christ jesu teach many great truth especially many about himself he claim to have come down from god he say he wa the way to god he say he wa the son of god who alone know god perfectly he say that whoever believe on him have eternal life and no one else have it he say that whatever we ask god in hi name he would grant it to u thu when he do rise from the grave on the third day he reveal that in these amaze unparalleled prediction he speak the truth do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe that hi word be all true the point be do not the truth of the resurrection convince u that he be none other than the one he claim to be the son of god and then of course the fact that christ rise from the dead testify that he ha break the power of death and that he will some day raise u also up from the grave a he promise in other word if thi person jesu christ the son of god in all thi he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of ymy life for he say a life build on him would know forgivenes of sin hi compan ionship and help a joy that no circumstance can ever take away and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day those who have try it down through the age and there have be many have give their testimony and we today who believe also know
