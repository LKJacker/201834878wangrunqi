from dsegard daniel segard subject re easter what in a name wa re new testament double stan seanna seanna watson ask what be the objection to celebration of easter the objection naturally be in the way in which you phrase it easter or eashtar or ishtar or ishtartus or other spell be the pagan whore goddes of fertility therefore ymy question to me be what be the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddes when phrase that way i suspect or at least i would hope that it become immeadiately apparent what my objection to celebrate her would be it be celebration of the resurrection of jesu no you be think perhap of ressurection sunday i think though i not too crazy about the word sunday but i certainly like thi phrase much better than envoking the name of the whore goddes for that matter stay biblical and call it omar rasheet the feast of first fruit torah command that thi be observe on the day follow the sabbath of passover week sunday by any other name in modern parlance why be there so much objection to observe the resurrection on the day of the week on which it actually occur why jump it all over the calendar the way easter do why not just go with the sunday follow passover the way the bible ha it why seek after unbiblical method i do recall a command in scripture for u to celebrate the resurrection but it be the sole and only reason that we be christian how could we not celebrate it so what do thi question have to do with easter the whore goddes i be all for celebrate the resurrection just keep that whore out of the discussion if it be only the name which be a problem i suggest that if we be too concern about etymology there be a lot of word we be go to have to drop a an aside some terminally pc person here in ottawa want dictionary to be alter so that there be no negative definition associate with the word black so a not to offend person of colmy ye i have hear of ymy newspaper speak of the need to repave street with afro-canadiantop grin i still think blacktop sound better though a a short person i hope they will also remove the definition curt or surly associate with my physical description fine by me and while we be at it the left-handed person be both sinister and gauche so we probably will have some objection from that quarter a well in quebec french the word for the celebration of the resurrection be thi be etymologically relate to pesach passover and the pascal lamb so be the french canadian mostly roman catholic celebration better because it use the right name ye that sound much better to me is there anyone out there would think that phrase sound worse so from thi i infer that there be different rule for christian of jewish descent what happen to there be neither jew nor greek slave nor free male nor female for all be one in christ jesu read the letter to philemon now tell me wa philemon slave return to him were there different rule upon the slave than upon philemon how about male and female are there different rule that apply to them a well or if there be no more male and female can adam and steve get marry to each other in ymy congregation ye there be difference in form and function but the way we come to salvation in messiah remain the same no matter what my position in life i be in general not in favor of continue thi discussion a it seem repetitive but thi particular point be one that i believe be new the objection be not to have a holiday but to it name i like to suggest that person think very carefully about thi argument word often change their mean over time the day of the week be of course originally base on pagan god some christian prefer to refer to first day second day etc however the majority of christian have not be persuade the question seem to be whether it make any difference what the dictionary show a the derivation of a word if what person mean by it and think when they use it be different indeed i like to suggest that post like thi could themself be dangerou suppose person in general use easter to mean the celebration of christ resurrection posting try to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godes run the risk of create exactly the situation that they claim to oppose they be do their best to create a linkage in person mind between their celebration and the pagan goddes it not clear that thi be a healthy thing clh
