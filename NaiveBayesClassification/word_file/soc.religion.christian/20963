from shellgate llo larry l overacker subject re sspx schism in article jhpb joseph h buehler write description of true and false obedience obedience be not solely a matter of the nature of the command must also be take into account it be not enough to consider someone compliance or refusal and then say whether they be obedient or disobedient you also have to take into consideration whether the command be good or bad you ask where we be i would echo that question i not try to be contentiou but assume that the pope ha universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for ymy decision what prevent me from choose any doctrine i like and say that papal disagreement be an error that will be resolve in time thi be especially true since council of bishop have basically stand by the pope it appear that much of what ly at the heart of thi matter be disagreement over what be tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline my question to the supporter of sspx be thi is there any way that ymy position with respect to church reform could change and be conform to those of the pope assume that the pope position do not change and that the leader of sspx do jointly make such choice if not thi appear to be claim infallible teach authority if i adopt the view that i not wrong i ca be wrong and there no way i change my mind you must change your that i either leave the catholic church or it ha leave me the orthodox church do not recognize papal view authority a present in each bishop and in ecumenical council we regard the subsequent development of the doctrine regard papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the bishop of rome from the orthodox church without go into the merit of the great schism at least the orthodox agree that a split occur and do paly what appear to be semantic game like he the pope but we do recognize that what he do be effective word aside it appear to be a de facto split so where be we are we in another arian heresy complete with weak pope or be the sspx priest modern martin luther well the only way to answer that be to examine who be say what and what the traditional teach of the church be we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teach of the church be if thi be a simple matter east and west would not have be separate for over year many catholic will decide to side with the pope there be some soundnes in thi because the papacy be infallible so eventually some pope will straighten all thi out i think that the teach magisterieum of the church do not allow error in teach regard faith and moral even in the short term i may be wrong here i not roman catholic what would be the effect of a pope make an ex cathedra statement regard the sspx situation would it be honor if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again i not try to be contention i try to understand since i orthodox i get no real vest interest in the outcome one way or the other schism be a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command all schismatic be disobedient but it a superset so it do work the other way around not all disobeyer be schismatic the mere fact that the sspx priest do comply with the holy father desire do make them schismatic it do if the command wa legitimate sspx do not view the pope command a legitimate why thi be a very slippery slope but my problem with thi be thi accord to the traditional theology of holy order episcopal consecration do not confer jurisdiction it only confer the power of order the ability to confect the sacrament true enough jurisdiction must be confer by someone else with the power to confer it such a the pope the society bishop know the traditional theology quite well take great pain to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacrament that require a bishop one could argue that they be establish a non-geographic jurisdiction i do know if that even a concept or problem in catholic circle larry overacker llo lawrence overacker shell oil company information center houston tx llo
