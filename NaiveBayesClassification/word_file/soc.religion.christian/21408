from d andrew byler subject re serbian genocide work of god vera shantus noye write thi be what indicate to me that you may believe in predestination be i correct i do not believe in predestination i believe we all choose whether or not we will accept god gift of salvation to u again fundamental difference which ca really be resolve of course i believe in predestination it a very biblical doctrine a roman show among other passage furthermore the church ha alway teach predestination from the very begin but to say that i believe in predestination do not mean i do not believe in free will man freely choose the course of their life which be also affect by the grace of god however unlike the calvinist and jansenist i hold that grace be resistable otherwise you end up with the idiocy of deny the universal save will of god timothy for god must give enough grace to all to be save but only the elect who he foreknow be predestine and receive the grace of final perserverance which guarantee heaven thi do not mean that those without that grace ca be save it just mean that god foreknow their obstinacy and choose not to give it to them know they would not need it a they have freely choose hell person who be save be save by the grace of god and not by their own effort for it wa god who dispose them to himself and predestine them to become saint but those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they harden their heart and choose to perish thu they be deserve of god s punishment a they have reject their creator and sin against the work of the holy spirit ye it be up to god to judge but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement well i would hold that a god most certainly gife everybody some bless for what good they have do even if it wa only a little for those he ca bles in the next life he bless in thi one and those he will not punish in the next life will be chastise in thi one or in purgatory for their sin every sin incur some temporal punishment thu god will punish it unles satisfaction be make for it cf samuel david sin of adultery and murder be forgive but he wa still punish with the death of hi child and i need not point out the idea of punishment because of god judgement be quite prevelant in the bible sodom and gommorrah mosis bar from the holy land the slaughter of the cannanite annia and saphira jerusalem in ad etc if jesu stop the stone of an adulterou woman perhap thi be not a good parallel but i go to go with it anyway why should we not stop the murder and violation of person who may or may not be more innocent we should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf proverb but do that mean that christian should support a war in bosnium with the or even the involve i do not think so but i be an isolationist and disagree with foreign adventure in general but in the case of bosnium i frankly see no excuse for u get militarily involve it would not be a just war blessed after all be the peacemaker wa what my lord say not the interventionist my action in bosnium must be for peace and not for a war which be unrelated to anything to justify it for u andy byler
