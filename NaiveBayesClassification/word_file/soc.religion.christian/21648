from pduggan paul c duggan subject re baptism require faith in article aaronc aaron bryce cardena write colossian in him you be also circumcise in the put off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision do by christ have be bury with him in baptism and raise with him through ymy faith in the power of god who raise him from the dead in baptism we be raise to a new life in christ roman through a personal faith in the power of god my parent faith can not do thi do infant have faith let look at what the bible ha to say about it i do think the issue of whether infant have faith be relevant or not certainly they can a the example of john in utero prove i find the translation of col above odd in term of the circumcision of christ which the kjv and rsv put in term of christ cricumcision which we in union with him participate in put off the body of sin of the flesh also perhap cor be divide the act of burial with him in baptism which can be independant of faith from the experience of rise with christ by faith who say both be by faith thi interpretation ha the advantage of explain those who be faithlessly baptize for whom their baptisim be not benefit but serve to put them into the kingdom nonetheles like the israelite all of them child include who be baptize in the cloud and in the sea it wa of no advantage because they do not add to their baptism faith and obedience baptism do not impart faith nor be it do strictly speak on the basi of the faith of the parent but because of the covcenant promise of god it impart grace the grace of the kingdom which can be a punishement in disguise if there be later apostacy roman but not all the israelite accept the good news for isaiah say who ha believe my message consequently faith come from hear the message and the message be hear through the word of christ so then we receive god gift of faith to u a we hear the message of the gospel faith be a possible response to hear god word preach kid be not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to god word hence they can not have faith and therefore can not be raise in baptism to a new life do you teach a child to pray the lord prayer do you expect them to not steal they can have faith appropriate to their condition and in the new covenant we shall no longer say know the lord for they shall all know him from the least unto the greatest heb if you read all of ezekiel you will see that god do hold u guilty for anyone else sin so we can have no original guilt from adam but also accord to ezekiel god will not hold innocent anyone on the basi of anyone else innocense thu jesu could not be my federal head any more than adam if that what ezekiel be talk about shall you make ezekiel contradict the second commandemnt a well ezekiel rid yourself of all the offense you have committted and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o house of israel for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declare the sovereign lord repent and live the way to please god be to repent and get a new heart and spirit kid can not do thi act say that when we repent and be baptize we will then receive a new spirit the holy spirit then we shall live ezekiel indicate that thi new heart will be give by god in the context of the sprinkle of water in baptism it be the action of god put them into hi new order and not a question of personal faith a such roman therefore just a sin enter the world through one man and death through sin and in thi way death come to all man because all sin sin and death enter the world when the first man sin death come to each man because each man sin note that it good to read through all of roman some of the verse be easier to misunderstand than other but if we read them in context we will see that they be all say basically the same thing let look at one such but the death that come to all because of sin be not just their personal death but the dead state originbal sin we be in a covenant of death because adam my federal head give over hi dominion to the devil and death psalm surely i wa sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceive me thi whole psalm be a wonderful example of how we should humble ourself before god in repentance for sin david himself wa a man after god own heart and write the psalm after commit adultry with bathsheba and murder her husband all that david be say here be that he ca remember a time when he wa sinful he be humble himself before god by confess hi sinfulnes hi say that he wa sinful at birth be a hyperbole the bible be inspire by god be limit to a literal interpetation but also use figure of speech a do jesu john for another example of hyperbole see luke while thi psalm be figurative in it language it be not hyperbolic and the one do not necessarily imply the other there be not other hyperbolic language in thi psalm what v be likely refer to be what be symbolize by the ot cleanlines law which make intercourse and childbrith both act which cau uncleanne and seperation from god the whole psalm be in the language of ot ritual hyssop cleanse burn offer etc david sin with bathsheba include thi element a he do not ritually cleanse himself when he should have but what wa symbolize by the ot ritual wa the truth that sin wa pass generationally that why the organ of generation have to be cut that why brith wa unclean uncleannes wa death and all baby be bear dead and need to be wash to newnes of life which we have in baptism today paul duggan
