from desiree bradley subject being right about messiah i must have miss the post about waco david koresh and the second coming how do one tell if a second coming be the real thing unles the person claim to be it be obviously insane i not say that david koresh be the second coming of christ how could somebody who break hi word be the second coming koresh do promise that he would come out of hi compound if only he wa allow to give a radio broadcast he do still it seem to me that he do fool some person and from my meagre knowledge of the bible it seem that christian have be hard on the jew of christ day for be cautiou about accept somebody that their religiou authority do accept a the messiah so i wa surprise that nobody have discuss the difficulty of want to be early to recognize the second coming while at the same time not want to be credulously believe just anybody who claim to be god mark and then if any one say to you here be the christ or there he be do not believe it mark false christ and false prophet will arise and show sign and wonder to lead astray if possible the elect mark but take heed i have tell you all thing beforehand mark but in those day after that tribulation the sun will be darken and the moon will not give it light mark and the star will be fall from heaven and the power in the heaven will be shake mark and then they will see the son of man come in cloud with great power and glory my understand of jesu answer be that unlike hi first come which wa veil the second come will be quite unmistakeable he tell u not to be mislead by the other thing that have to happen before hi second come the actual second come will make hi power openly visible by the way from koresh public statement it not so clear to me that he be claim to be christ clh
