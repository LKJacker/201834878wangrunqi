canaan and make the fateful choice to go their own way rather than god way they refuse an adventure of faith in god which would have give them canaan the homeland of promise god honor their decision and say they would wander in the desert only a few mile from the land of promise until they be all bury in the sand the young decision maker of that fateful day be between twenty and thirty year old and destine to be dead within forty year bleach bone in the desert by the time they be seventy eighty at the most the life of these wanderer have be unending sadnes mosis describe it a end each year with a sigh v the fact that they know give or take a few month when they be go to die underscore the meaninglessnes of their existence whatever height of succes they reach they would be a heap of bleach bone within forty year the only one to live outside of that depression of hopeles disbelief be joshua and caleb who have stand against the nation at kadesh and have god s promise of one day enter the land the forty-year period wa finally draw to an end the new generation those who be child at kadesh be now grow and eager to take the inheritance their parent have refuse to enjoy in the light of thi mosis pray it be time for a new day to begin and the day of misery to be over all these year a mosis have walk with these moan and complain person through the wildernes of their exile he have carry a double burden hi wa not only the sadnes of live in le than what could have be but he also know why they have choose a they have at kadesh the problem wa that they be ignorant of the character of their god if ask who be ymy god they would have describe him a the god who be power when aaron have create their concept of god in an idol he choose a calf or young bull a symbol of power of virility in their mind god wa the young bull who have impale pharaoh on hi horn and gore egypt god a he lead israel to sinai but when man worship a god of power hi miracle grow thin and even bore after miracle food on the desert floor and water gush miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland the god of almightines become ho-hum what s next on the miracle menu and a god of power can be a unpredictable a a young bull calf he might be all they need but then who know if he ha all power he ha a right to do whatever he want whenever he want the only person these person have know who have absolute power wa pharaoh and man life have hang on the whim of hi mood which could change with the wind they believe god could work hi wonder on their behalf but they do not know him and so could not trust him israel have a god base on what he did hi act mosis know the heart of god the motivation behind the act from the day of hi encounter at the burn bush mosis have be fascinate by god at sinai he ask to be show hi glory to know who he really wa he have see what god have do he want to know who god wa thi request wa grant and mosis wa give a glimpse of god gloriou person he have come to know the heart of god a compassion and lovingkindnes exodu the word lovingkindnes be not to be understand a a human kind of love it speak of the kind of relationship arise out of the make of a covenant it can only be understand a the love that say i will never leave you nor forsake you lovingkindnes be a tenaciou a a british bulldog when the world walk out thi love dig in it heel and refuse to it be not human romantic love base on feel and root in emotion it be a love of covenant commitment and therefore operate quite apart from feel god love be not an emotion that waver day by day it be the total commitment of hi being to seek my highest and best and to bring u to my fullest potential a human god do not see something good and beautiful in u which arouse hi feel of love toward u we do not woo him and cause him to fall in love with u if that be the case the first ugly sinful thing we do would cause him to reject u he be love and he love u because of who he be not because of who we be he do not love what we do but he be commit to u pursue u down every blind alley and bypath of foolishnes he will not let u go hi be a love that be not look for what it can get out of u but a commit love that search for opportunity to give to u it be say to the recipient for a long a we shall live i be for you the god who ha reveal himself to man through scripture and finally in jesu in hi come and in hi death and resurrection be the god who be lovingkindnes thu he love u and gife himself to u he will never leave u nor forsake u tragically many believer have never see him a love they see him a power no one will come to faith by just see miracle miracle point to who he be and that be when faith spring in the heart israel do not see god a lovingkindnes they saw hi act of power mosis know hi way the kind of god he wa and the love that he have for these person because of their total lack of understand of hi love they could not trust him to be their strength in take the land faith be bear out of know the love he ha for u it be the rest response to the one who gife himself to u he be not the force and to call him the almighty be to mi hi heart he be love who be the almighty and the infinite force if man be to make force or raw power work for him he must depend on know the forrnula and have faith in it but the power that issue from love demand faith in the person of love himself the forty year of meaningles wander wa a monument to a person who have never come to know the god of love at thi point with the new generation and the possibility of enjoy all that god promise mosis pray verse the language mosis use be reminiscent of a baby have sleep secure in it mother love now wake to look up into the delight of her eye it be wake to the consciousnes of be love watch over care for protect feed and clean day and night by the mother suppose we be to ask what ha the baby do to deserve thi or have arrangement be make for the child to repay the parent for thi inconvenience my question would be consider unnatural even immoral the child wa conceive in love anticipate and prepare for with love excitement a love that ha be to the gate of death to bring it into be the parent love be unconditional spontaneou it ha nothing to do with the look of the child or it performance so god be love he love u unconditionally spontaneously we be conceive in hi imagination and fashion after hi image to be bring to where we be at thi moment by the blood of the lord jesu it be slanderou and immoral to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love the child discover it personhood and identity through the eye and touch through the cuddle of it parent love it be a scientific fact that a baby who be not touch and hold will probably die or if it survife will have severe emotional problem and a person who ha be hold and love will still never know the true mean of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from god mosis pray that the new generation will learn to wake every morning rest with total confidence in the love of god and will receive all hi promise and bless with joy and gladnes significantly mosis pray that they will be satisfied with hi love satisfied in the hebrew language be a rich picture word describe be fill with an abundance of gourmet food it be also use to describe the earth after the rain ha soak it and all the vegetation ha receive enough water mosis pray that they will awaken every morning to be drench in the life-giving love of god that sense of satisfaction be the lifelong quest of every man and woman when we be satisfy in my deepest self many of my emotional and even my physical problem disappear man seek that sense of satisfaction which come from feel that he be fulfil a a human be hi hour have mean which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane apart from god man seek thi satisfaction through intellectual pursuit through the excite of the emotion and through the feed of hi body he will even seek it in religiou exercise but man will alway be dissatisfy until he be respond to the love of the live god only in know god love will the rest of life make sense a the forty year draw to a close and the land of promise again become the inheritance to be take mosis pray thi psalm i find it fascinate that he should pray and ask god for a daily revelation of hi love considering the awe with which the person hold mosis one would think he could have lecture them on the subject of lovingkindnes and by the knowledge they gain they would live in it but mosis know better god be the only one who can make know to u hi love we wo find it in a religiou lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate him nor be it in a beautiful poem to titillate my emotion and give u god feel it be god himself the lover who must open my eye and satisfy u with hi love thi prayer be man in helplessnes ask god to make the love he be real in my heart mosis prayer wa partially answer in the next generation and see in the exploit of faith which work by love in the book of judge but it would not be answer in it fullest dimension until the come of the holy spirit who pour out the love of god in my heart roman in the history of the early church we read of the holy spirit fall upon the believer thi be an ancient expression that in modern english mean to give a bear hug it be use in luke to describe the father run to the prodigal and fall on hi neck and kiss him the holy spirit be god hug you in ymy deepest self and smother you with divine kiss at the deepest level of ymy be thi be not a one-time experience to be file in my spiritual resume mosis pray that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we be love the world and much of my religiou train ha teach u to perform in order to be accept we have spend far too long live in a state of do in order to find satisfaction for ourself to find acceptance and love from other and from god we now come humble to receive love we can not earn to be still and let him tell u we be love to let the holy spirit descend into u pour out the love of god we come in stillnes to think on and repeat hi word of love to my mind which have be jade with the doctrine of perform to be accept we begin to realize that he love u a we be and gife mean and purpose to all of life i challenge everyone read thi to begin each day from the moment you open ymy eye by celebrate the god of love and pray thi prayer you may not feel anything but something alway happen i wa x-rayed the other day i do not see or feel anything but i note that the technician keep behind protective wall they know you can not be expose to those ray without be affect so it be a we consciously begin my day know that we be love such experiential knowledge will produce accord to mosis joy and gladnes all my day joy be the result of a life that be function a god intend u to function when he make u you might say that joy be the hum of an engine that be at peak performance man s highest performance be to rest in the love god ha for him the hum will be joy and the result will be endles creativity arise from the sense of mean he now ha in life stop wander in the wildernes be satisfy with hi love and in joy day by day receive all hi promise bless end included message
