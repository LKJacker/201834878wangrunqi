from crep stephen a crep subject re quality of catholic liturgy in article jemurray john e murray write example last sunday palm sunday we go to the local church usually on palm sunday the congregation participate in read the passion take the role of the mob the theology behind thi seem profound when we say crucify him we mean it we do it and if he come back today we do it again it alway gife me chill but last week we be invite to sit during the gospel passion and listen beside the orwellian invitation on palm sunday at my parish we be invite to take the role of jesu in the passion i decline to participate last year at the liturgy meet i point out how we crucify christ by my sin so therefore it be appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd but to no avail musician reader and so on new thing be introduce in the course of the liturgy and since no one know what happen the new thing have to be explain and pretty soon instead of do a lot of the mas we just sit there listen or space out in my case to how the mas be about to be do in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committee make up of lay expert but that may not be just i do think that a liturgy committee ha a bia toward do something rather than nothing that just a fact of bureaucratic life even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for person to be aware of the lord presence a a member of a liturgy committee i can tell you that the problem be certain person dominate who want to try out all kind of innovation the priest do seem even to want to make any decision of their own in many case i gues it easier to try something new than it be to refuse to allow it at my parish on holy thursday instead of the priest wash foot who want to get around person foot accord to one of my priest the congregation wa invite to come up and help wash one another hand the symbolism of thi action distress me and again i refuse to participate i think that if we be to have to come up with rubric for thi liturgical action body of christ aman for receive communion that they could be i be not responsible for the blood of thi man also for part of the eucharistic prayer blessed be you god of all creation wa substitute some text read by a lay couple the priest certainly should not have give thi part of the mas over to other and i wa so disturb that i decline to receive communion that night we be require to anyway i instead offer up prayer for my priest and parish so we be wonder be we the oddball or be the quality of the mas go down i do mean that facetiously we go to mas every thursday or friday and be remind of the power of a very simple liturgy to make u aware of god presence but a far a the obligatory sunday mass maybe i should just offer it up ha anyone else notice decline congregational participation in catholic mass lately the quality of the mas ha not change again if it be to be celebrate accord to the rubric set down by the church it would still be liturgically beautiful the problem come about from person try to be creative who be not i think the answer to ymy question on participation could be that give by father peter stravinska in answer to the question pose by the title of thoma day why catholic ca sing they do want to because of all thi nonsense by the way for any non-catholic read thi the problem do not reflect bad liturgy by the catholic church but by those who be disobedient to the church in change it on their own authority steve crep indiana university crep
