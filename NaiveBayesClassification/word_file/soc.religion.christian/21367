from michael d walker subject re portland earthquake archau austin c archer write i be interest in view about the non-event of may seriously how can a christian discriminate between message from god which be to be take seriously and those which be spuriou is there a useful heuristic which would help u avoid embrace message which by their non-fulfillment be prove to be false thu cause the name of christ to be place in disrepute is thi a problem at all i believe that a careful understand of scripture can help u here it seem to me that anytime we be prove by event to be mistake it point to a seriou failure in understand god will it should result in a reevaluation of what we accept a truth i must hasten to add that i wa alway skeptical even cynical about these prophesy a i tend to be concern all such but clearly many christian put much stock in them if the church represent christ in the world then christian must avoid be make the laughing-stock of the world lest we dishonor him further the more often we cry wolf the le seriously we tend to be take any comment good point it be very true that these false prediction be dangerou we be warn more than once in scripture about false prophtet however a be often the case with other issue one can not let those who falsly report such vision a a reason against believe in any of them i do not get the impression you be assert thi by the way i consider my response not so much a response to ymy post but a response to the topic a a whole example the appearance of mary at fatima portugal in among other thing she predict the conversion of russium to atheism something that happen le than a year later w the bolshevik revolution she also predict the second world war that be predicte predict that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope who wa not the current one it happen just like she say she warn there would be fire in the sky a a warn that the second world war wa about to start about a week before germany invade weatherman and woman i suppose all over europe from england to spain to eastern europe report the most spectacular reddish color in the sky ever record to thi day some try to explain it off a the northern light and the relation to mary prediction simply coincidence you all can decide for yourself mary predict that the atheistic russium would spread her evil all over the world and persecute religion she say many other thing a well too numerou to list here every single one ha be realize one can only use the term coincidence so many time in the same explanation before it use become ridiculou so ye there be many false prophet and many false report there be true one too we must alway remain open to that fatima wa one example there be another one currently occur the apparition that have be take place at medjurgorje yugoslavium or whatever it call now mary ha be appear every day for eleven year now it time the world start listen more info available to any who want it peace in christ my lord mike walker
