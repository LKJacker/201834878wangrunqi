from ml michael siemon subject re deuterocanonical esp sirach in michael d walker write that last paragraph just about kill me the deuterocanonical have alway be accept a inspire scripture by the catholic church which ha exist much longer than any protestant church out there it wa martin luther who begin hack up the bible and decide to remove certain book not the fact that the catholic church decide to add some much later that be the reason for the difference between catholic and protestant bible thi be mislead at best the question really ha to do with the statu of the greek septuagint versu hebrew scripture and the issue predate the reformation by quite a bite jerome wa negative about the deuteroncanonical and in fact even though he transalted them he put them after the hebrew canon reorder from the greek order to the hebrew one hi translation of them be quick-and-dirty also he report have do one of them in one day and another overnight just dictate hi translation to an amanuensi that be to say it be the vulgate and all of it massive importance in western christianity along with the veneration of jerome which take the first step in reduce these book from the statu they have and have among the greek furthermore it be inaccurate to say that the reformer throw out these book basically they just place them in a secondary statu a jerome have already do but with the additional warn that doctrine should not be base on citation from these alone i think that the emphasi on the hebrew original be sound though it seem somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation a part of a collection whose principle of selection in hebrew or greek be confuse or unknown and likely fraught with accident it also seem to play into a tendentiou notion of the original language be somehow more inspire a if magical and convey a message untranslatable than a translation a if we could not hear god word to the jew in greek or german or english thi tendency seem to have get a big boost in sola scriptura protestantism even to the point of current inerrancy bizarrenes despite the more basic underlie tendency of the reformer to see that the text should and could be translate if we can profit from an english render of hebrew and greek there be surely little reason to keep sirach at least out of my bible and of course anglican do do so for text originally in greek it would seem more to be anti-greek prejudice notably by the time the hebrew canon be fully attest include anti-christian prejudice which lead to the jewish abandonment of the septuagint which be operative btw reader may enjoy some lecture of bruce metzger on the issue of translation of the bible include some of what i say about jerome above in the current number of the journal bibliotheca sacra two of fmy have be publish so far michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you nevertheles or you shall die like man and fall ml like any prince psalm
