from halsall paul halsall subject weirdnes of early christian i be a good catholic boy a convert no le attract by the rational tradition aquina et al and the emotional authenticity in comp with the faddishnes of anglicanism to roman catholicism i never have much time for the pope or any other heirarch but i do and do believe in the sacremental system i alway felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such a john emery a few post back who have to engage in circuitou textual argument to prove their faith entirely obliviou to the fact that a dozen other faith can do the same with miracle too and that since their argument depend on the belief in the bible a god sole revelation it wa not very good logic to argue that the bible prove god no i wa happy to accept the church a god revelation it wa the church after all that exist before the bible the church that choose under grace of course the canon of scripture protestant ludicrosity i think wa show by protestant breathtaking acceptance of luther right to reject a dozen or so book he dislike but recently i read peter brown body and society it be very well research and well write but be raise some very upset question the early christian be weird even more so than today carzy fundy they have odd view on sex odder view on the body totally ludicrou view about demon and distinctly uncharitable view about other human be now the question be thi be the first christian just a weird but we get use to them or do the pristine fall of the church happen within one generation it certainly have to wait until the triumph of the church under constantine if so wha do thi say about god promise to alway support the church it no use throw the usual protestant piety about the church not be an organization at me it a community or it be nothing and it wa the early community that be weird the institional church wa a model of sanity by comparison i would be interest in seriou catholic and orthodox response to thi entirely seriou issue i not sure it be an issue for protestant with their soul alone with jesu approach but for we who see the ecclesium a a koinoium over time and space the weird early christian be a problem thi be an exaggeration of the protestant view many protestant have a strong appreciation for the role of the church the soul alone with god be certainly important for protestant but it by no mean the whole story i have read the sort of history you talk about a you point out protestant do have quite the same problem you do because we believe that the church have a fall at some point however protestant mythology typically place the fall around the time of constantine or more likely regard it a happen in a sort of cumulative fashion start from constantine but get worse a the pope accumulate power during the medieval period the consequence of have it earlier be somewhat worrisome even to u most protestant accept the theological result of the early ecumenical council include such item a the trinity and incarnation indeed in the work of reformer such a luther and calvin you find church father such a augustine quote all the time i think you find many protestant resistant to the idea that the early church a a whole wa wierd there be an additional problem for protestant that i do much want to talk about in thi context since it be look at recently that the question of whether one can really think of augustine and other father a be proto-protestant their view on mary the authority of the pope etc be not entirely congenial to protestant think one thing that somewhat worry me be a question of methodology there be certainly plenty of wierd person in the early church what concern me be that they may be overrepresented in what we see we see every christian who court martyrdom but i think there good reason to believe that most ordinary christian be more prudent than that we see the heroic virgin but i think there good reason to think that many christian be happily marry i ca help suspect that the early church have the same range of wierdo and sane person that we do now i think there also a certain level of revisionism active in history at the moment i do mean that they manufacture thing out of whole cloth but do you think there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel clh
