from maureen maureen brucker subject is thi ethical the follow wa publish in the may rocky mountain news i gues i have some real ethical problem with the practice at thi church i understand that baptism be an override factor i also understand that thi be not an honest way to proceed unfortunately thi be become more typical of congregation a the second coming be perceive to approach there be a real element of disparation in thi it happen at any cost style of theology i wonder where trust in the lord fit into thi equation baptism draw parent ire child at church carnival in spring tell they be kill by bee sting if they do submit to religiou rite by dick foster rocky mountain news southern bureau colorado spring outraged parent say their child be lure to a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a baptist minister doxen of child some a young a year old and unaccompanied by their parent think they be go to a carnival at the cornerstone baptist church where there would be a big water fight free balloon squirt gun and candy before that may carnival wa over however child be whisk into a room for religiou instruction and tell they should be baptize in many case they consent although they or their family be not of the baptist faith the baptism by the church have anger many parent include paulette lamontagne a methodist and mother of twin girl who be baptize without her knowledge or consent understnading wa they be go to a carnival i feel that a false pretense say lamontagne her daughter say the minister tell them they would be kill by bee sting if they be not baptize cornerstone church official defend their action take my instruction from the word of god and god ha command u to baptize convert no one can show me one passage in the bible where it say that parental permission be require before a child be baptize say dan irwin associate pastor of the cornerstone baptist church church official do not tell parent their child would be baptize because do ask irwin say many other parent also felt they be simply send their child to a carnival at the invitation of their child friend who be member of the cornerstone church polouse say chhurch official have break on law in baptize the child but indicate the parent could pursue civil action are these the same behavior we condemn in the harus krishna and other cult i think the issue be more complex than the newspaper account mention first i not entirely sure that parental consent be absolutely require thi would be extremely difficult because of the clear commandment to obey parent but if an older child insist on be baptize without their parent consent i might be will to do it however thi would be a seriou step and would warrant much careful discussion the problem i find here be not so much parental consent a that there wa nobody consent whether you believe in infant baptism or not baptism be suppose to be the sign of entry into a christian community if there be a commitment from somebody whether parent or child and no intent to become part of the church the baptism appear to be a lie furthermore it be likely to raise seriou practical problem what if the child be from a baptist tradition normally when he reach the age of decision he would be expect to make a decision and be baptize but he already ha be by a church claim to be a baptist church so do he get rebaptized neither answer be really very good if not he be rob of an experience that should be very significant to hi faith clh
