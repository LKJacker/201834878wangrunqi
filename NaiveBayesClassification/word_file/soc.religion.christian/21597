from hudson paul hudson jr subject re faq essay on homosexuality in article hedrick write thi come from here hi response kinsey see below be the source of the figure percent there wa an article in usa today a few month ago show the result of a study that actually only about be homosexual i saw another figure that list a the figure of course even if it be that would have little bear on whether or not it be a sinful behavior how many person have commit other act of fornication how many person have lie or sin in other way but in all fairnes the shameles nature of their act be a reflection of the general spiritual state of the person and not a specific feature of homosexuality why be it a specific feature of homosexuality paul describe man with man work that which be unseemly to describe the act sure there spirtual nature wa deprave also and like the other sin the idolatry the other sexual immoraity and the other sin spring from their deprave spiritual state which wa a result of man not glorify god a god and be thankful still their act be shameles homosexuality or even consider it acceptable in some case on the other hand none of these passage contain explicit teach on the subject rom be really about idolatry it refer to homosexuality in pass is everything sinful specifically elaborate on in the new testament scripture do not condemn be a drug dealer being rule by the spirit rather than the letter not only free from legalism it also protect u from sin that be against the spirit the word be a two edge sword that cut both way i think we must be careful before we totally throw out leviticu if the law be reflection of god character and true holy nature then those who say that god endorse homosexuality run into a problem if homosexuality be natural whatever that mean wholesome endorse by god and those who oppose sexual behavior be narrow-minded biggot a some would have u believe why be there a condemnation of it in leviticu thi condemnation be in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnation and there be nothing in the text to say that thi law wa limit to temple prostitution and no good reason to believe that thi wa the case furthermore male homosexual sex wa a death-penalty crime is every sin elaborate on in the new testament take a look at i corinthian paul say that one of the corinthian have break a law not even hear of among the gentile that one should have hi father wife there be a prohibition against have ymy father wife in leviticu no other new testament verse clearly condemn it beside thi one notice that paul do not say that the sin wa in commit adultery etc he speak against have one father wife notice also that thi sexual condemnation in leviticu be not mention in the specific context of paganism either and there wa no pagan coustom mention in i corinthian either a a matter of fact take one father wife wa even do among the gentile it wa just a plain blantant sin whether worship idol wa involve or not one commonly make claim be that paul have simply never face the kind of question we be try to deal with he encounter homosexuality only in context where most person would probably agree that it wa wrong he have never face the experience of christian who try to act straight and fail and he have never face christian who be try to define a christian homosexuality which fit with general christian ideal of fidelity and of see sexuality a a mirror of the relationship between god and man it be unfair to take paul judgement on homosexuality among idolater and use it to make judgement on these question one of the reason that some of u do not accept that common argument be because paul probably do face thi and other problem sin can be tough to over come especially without supernatural power is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin like lust after a marry woman or sleep around with person of the opposite sex i doubt it and even if it be that be no excuse god be greater than all of it another reason we reject it be because it ignore the supernatural power of god to intervene in thi kind of situation how many person have be set free from sin by the power of god sure there may be any group that have try to change homosexual and fail that be a reflection on the person involve in the program and not god willingnes and ability to change a sinner any program that use formula may fail what person need be the power of god to change them whether they be involve in homosexual sin or any other sin i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christian be not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one paul tendency a we can see in issue such a eat meat and celebrate holiday be to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issue to look very carefully at the good of the person involve and to avoid insist on perfection when it would be personally damage for example while paul clearly believe that it wa acceptable to eat meat he want u to avoid push person into do an action about which they have personal qualm i do see how you come to that conclusion paul deal with pastorial issue encourage person to give up their liberty in order to spare other not to allow person to continue in sin because it wa just too difficult take the example of eat meat offer to idol paul felt that there wa nothing wrong in an abstract sense with eat the meat yet he advise believer to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare other but paul never allow person to sin because live holy wa just to tough paul write to make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof roman then he go in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice my own liberty in order to spare the conscience of other suppose it be not a sin for person to practice homosexual act since other consider it to be a sin then use paul approach on pastorial issue those who would otherwise be homosexual should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously marry to a member of the opposite sex paul never offer a lesser sin homosexual marriage to prevent person from engage in what may be consider a more damage sin for another example paul obviously would have prefer to see person at least in some circumstance remain unmarried yet if they be unable to do so he certainly would rather see them marry than in a state where they might be tempt to fornication yet marriage itself be not a sin marriage be holy in all and something that god ordain and paul recognize thi note that in the creation story work enter human life a a result of sin thi do mean that christian can stop work when we be save actually adam wa put in the garden to tend to it before he fell after he fell he would have to toil over the grind the danger of try to cure it be that the attempt most often fail and when it do you end up with damage range from psychological damage to suicide a well a break marriage when attempt at live a a heterosexual fail that be why we be dependent totally on god what a vunerable and gloriou position to be it we all must be transform by the renew of my mind and that be the only way homosexual can walk in freedom just like anyone else but i can well imagine paul prefer to see person in long-term commit christian relationship than promiscuity a with work which genesi suggest wa part of god original ideal either i think such relationship can still be a vehicle for person share god love with each other i sure you can see how person with the oppose view see thi conclusion it like say how should i kill myself with gun or aresenic what about the person who just be overcome with a desire to sleep with goat would it be better for him to sleep with one goat or all of them what about the person who want to sleep with hi aunt would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them in all these case the more person or animal one sleep with the higher the chance that they will get a disease but thi only deal with physical aspect of the question whichever sin be commit it all lead to spiritual death cent action be the same when christian homosexual say that their relationship be different than the greek homosexuality that paul would have be familiar with thi be exactly the same kind of argument that be be make about judicial oath and tax collector the issue that be most often address in scripture seem to be the actual act second be it historical snobbery to say that only homosexual of thi century be capable of have love relationship there be ancient write glorify homosexual love btw i be one who believe in refrain from make oathe also where do you get that tax collector be sinner that certainly not explicit jesu do tell zachia to quit hi job link hudson i reluctant to comment in thi in detail my basic concept of the intention of jesu and paul be greatly different a i indicate in the article whatever the ambiguity of variou word and i still think they be significant it do seem clear that paul consider the homosexuality he saw around him wrong what you do with thi fact depend upon ymy basic approach to the bible i afraid that communication between legalist and anti-legalist christian be even harder than between protestant and catholic in the cent since you disagree with my start point obviously you go to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusion sometime discussion be still useful i see some very interest work on paul do by jew obviously they do agree with him but they sometime have helpful insight into what he mean but i do see much sign for hope here in there an axiom that by the time hitler name be invoke all hope for sensible discussion be go on thi subject when sleep with goat be invoke i do think there enough basi for understand to be worth pursue clh
