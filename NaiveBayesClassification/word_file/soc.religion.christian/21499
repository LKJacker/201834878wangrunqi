from subject christianity and repeat life there be a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion clearly make a positive inference to reincarnation i do remember which one it be off of the top of my head but it basically go like thi jesu be talk with the apostle and they ask him why the pharisee say that before the messiah can come elijah must first come jesu reply that elijah ha come but they do not recognize him it then say that the apostle perceive that he wa refer to john the baptist thi seem to me to clearly imply reincarnation thi wa a popular belief in the judaism of jesu time that elijah would return again a he have be take in to heaven in a chariot and do not actually die however jesu wa refer to john the baptist not in the sense that elijah wa reincarnate a john remember elijah didn t die but that john wa a similar prophet to elijah john wa a fiery preacher he wear sackcloth and wander rough through israel preach the come kingdom the verse that describe him in mark s gospel can be link to ot reference about elijah hence john wa similar to elijah and jesu wa draw the parallel between the two just a he draw parallel with the suffering servant in isaiah and other messianic figure and himself a brief reply but i don t have time to look up all the relevant stuff suffice to say there be a very strong explanation rick richard johnston queen s university malone road belfast belfast northern ireland
