from kempmp petrus pihko subject re atheist view on christianity wa re accepting jeesu in ymy heart first i thank collectively all person who have give good answer to my question in my follow-up to jason smith post i will addres some issue that have cause misunderstand jason smith jason write in article kempmp petrus pihko write i also concede that i wa doubly remis a i assert no reasonable alternative exist an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidate give time and further discovery by the scientist i also understand that a prove a theory do not necessarily specify that thi be how it happen but propose a likely description of the phenomenon in question am i mistake with thi understand ye to some degree there wa an excellent discussion in on the nature of scientific work two week ago i hope it do not escape ymy notice the correct word be there be no way to be sure my model and theory be absolutely correct theory be back up by evidence but not prove no theory can be in a mathematical sense however theory be not mere description or rationalisation of phenomenon it be extremely important to test whether theory can predict something new or not yet observe all successful theory science ha come up with have pass thi test include the big bang theory of cosmic evolution the theory of natural selection etc it do not mean they must be correct but they be not mere fit for the datum but if you claim that there must be an answer to how do the universe my spacetime emerge from nothing science ha some good candidate for an answer all of which require something we christian readily admit to faith well ye if you want to believe in them thi be not what science require take a good look at the theory and the evidence see if the theory ha make any successful prediction and use ymy reason disbeliever be not punish the fact that there be several candidate bely that none be conclusive with out conclusive evidence we be leave with faith thi be what puzzle me why do we need to have faith in anything my fellow atheist would call me a weak atheist someone who be unable to believe ie fail to entertain any belief in god ye i know that one ca believe without god help luther make thi quite clear in hi letter to erasmu i afraid thi do not change my situation a couple of paragraph delete summary we ask why do the universe exist i think thi question should actually be split into two part namely why be there existence why anything exist and how do the universe emerge from nothing deletion the question why anything exist can be counter by demand answer to a question why there be nothing in nothingnes or in non-existence actually both question turn out to be devoid of mean thing that exist do and thing that do exist do exist tautology at it best carefully examine the original question and then the counter-question the first ask why while the second be a request for definition no it be not although it do look like one thi be a true dichotomy either something exist or nothing exist if nothing exist nobody would ask why if something exist it be possible to ask why but actually no exist be could give an answer imagine for a moment that the nobody in non-existence could also ask why nothing exist thi be equivalent to my counter-question why nothing exist in nothingnes now why anything exist be equivalent to why something exist in somethingnes thi be what i mean with my tautology my apology for the poor word in my previou post i might add the worldview of thing that exist do and thing that do do be a ground in the realm of the non-falsifiable a do the theist belief in god it be base on the assumption that there be not a reason for be something a ultimately un supportable a the position of there be a reason it very foundation exist in the same soil a that of one who claim there be a reason i do indeed think there probably be no reason for be or existence in general for reason i state above however they will still leave open the question why thi and not that and thi be where theistic explanation come in science can not give reason for any particular human be existence we come to thi either i be therefore i be or i be for a reason thi be a deep philosophical question be determinism true or not also be god deterministic or not i tend to think thi question ha no mean in hi case if i be for a reason i yet fail to see what it would be from my perspective it look like exist for truly random reason i just roll two dice why do i get and how can i believe there be any better reason for my existence if the former be a satisfactory answer then you be do for you be satisfy and need not a doctor if the latter ymy search be just begin ye i be satisfy with thi reason until i find something better my year of christianity be of no help in thi respect i have to admit but i be patient another answer be that god be the source of all existence thi sound much better but i be tempt to ask do god himself exist then if god be the source of hi own existence it can only mean that he ha in term of human time alway exist but thi be not the same a the source of all existence thi do not preclude hi existence it only seek to identify hi quality imply he exist to have quality btw no it do but i think an exist god can not know why he exist for an answer to thi question be not knowable of course thi should not be any obstacle to belief in hi existence i also have discover science be an inadequate tool to answer why it appear that m pihko agree a we shall see but because a tool be inadequate to answer a question do not preclude the question asserting that be an invalid question do not provide an answer it be impossible to know unknowable thing however the question why do i exist in particular be not an invalid question thi be not what i say but from my perspective it be impossible to tell and i ca just believe in any give explanation instead of another especially since i find i wa delude myself my apology i wa use why a why do thi come to be why do pre-existence become existence why do pre-spacetime become spacetime i think pre-existence be an oxymoron there be no time of thi spacetime except in some other universe and from that perspective my universe never wa it exist only for those who be inside it but we come to the admission that science fail to answer why because it ca be answer in the realm of modern science do that make the question invalid no the validity of the question ha to be discuss separately i think philosophy be of great help here what can be know and what be not knowable m pihko do present a good point though we may need to ask what do i a an individual christian base my faith on will it be shake by the production of evidence that shatter my sacred cow or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagree with what god say and continue to say in hi word thi be a very good question in try to answer thi and numerou other question that bother me i finally find nothing to base my faith on i think it would be honest if we all ask ourself why do i believe or why i do believe petrus petrus pihko kem-pmp mathematics be the truth pihatie c
