from hall hal f lillywhite subject re ancient book i send in something on thi before but i believe it get lose in the weekend accident the moderator describe thi be an improve version anyway so no los the first time hl the standard work on detect forgery of ancient document be probably the write of friedrich blas hermeneutrik und kritik einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen vol of handbuch der klassischen altertum wissenshaft noerdlingen beck portion of thi be describe in nibley the prophetic book op mormon pp slc deseret book if you want to attempt read thi be forewarn nibley describe blas a a typical german scholar who claim little knowledge of hi subject then proceed to exhaust both the subject and the reader nibley extract from blas work be in the form of rule for forger it make interest read i confes that i have not read blas work only nibley extract thereof my german fall far short of what would be require and a far a i know there be no english translation available however i believe the technique he describe be know widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it be consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame we will not be able to prove who write it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it be from that time and culture or be a later forgery actually there be type of purportedly ancient document alleged actual holograph or early copy thereof for example the dead sea scroll these can be test by variou scientific mean to determine the age of the paper ink and object find with them thi can provide a pretty clear date of the actual physical object document claim to be copy of ancient work although the copy itself may be much more recent for example we might find a document which monk in a monastary claim be a copy of something from century ago perhap even have be through several generation of copist thi be more of a problem but can still be test although the test be not likely to be simple we can not expect a test of the age of the physical object to tell u much so we must confine my test to the text itself it be important to remember that none of these test can tell u if the document be really what it claim to be they can only date the document and identify it culture of origin for example i hear of a letter suppose to have be write by jesu himself to a king in what be now iraq if thi document be to actually turn up scholar could date the paper and ink assume they have the holograph they could check the language content and write style to see if they be consistent with what would be expect of a palestinian jew of that time however even if all test result be positive there be no way to determine if jesu himself actually write it we would know what time and culture it come from but bar a know sample of jesu handwrite or other clue for comparison scholarship must stop there there be seldom any way to determine who the actual author wa a i say i no expert on bla work i do remember some of the test which can be apply to allege copy of ancient work specifically we might ask is the document internally consistent do it contradict itself if the work it be short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it be a forgery the longer the forgery the more difficult it be to maintain consistency for thi reason most successful forger stick to short document is it consistent with the history and geography of the time again a short non-specific work might not be testable but if the write be of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection here we look for the minor inconspicuou thing which someone from that culture would get right without even think about it but which a later forger would find too numerou and trivial to check the devil be in the detail what about the literary style of the work figure of speech etc any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in way that seem strange to u are there any such odd phrase in thi book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there be complication if the document ha be translate or possibly even if somebody just update language when he copy it a few case of language not from the culture claim may be allow in recent copy they cause problem and reduce certainty to be sure but do necessarily prove forgery these test can be quite effective give enough material to work with but they be not easy they require the skill of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the question to ask be is every aspect of thi document consistent with what we know about the culture of claim origin if there be thing which do fit how significant be they are problem area due to my lack of knowledge later change by copist or be they really significant there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture the end result of any such test be occasionally certain particularly in the case of holograph or other ancient copy however often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document or maybe part of it be probably authentic or sometime maybe other part be later addition thi be often unsettle to a generation raise on tv where all problem be solve in to minute with time out for commercial it be however the real world and what scholarship ha to offer
