from autry larry autry subject definition of christianity i have enrol in the history of christianity at a college here in st loui the teacher of the clas be what i consider to be closed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of christianity be hi definition be tie directly to that of the trinity and the catholic church definition of it and belief in jesu christ be not sufficient to call one self a christian while hi say it do make it so i nevertheles feel insult or be i just neurotic i would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintain an amiable student-teacher relationship so be there common definition of what christianity be a the previou discussion of the trinity do not lend itself to an exchange of flame i be hopeful that thi will also not produce major flame regard larry autry silicon graphic st loui autry often we get into discussion about who be christian unfortunately there be a number of possible definition starting from the broadest commonly use definition be a historical definition person who accept christ a lord and savior a broad doctrinal definition narrow doctrinal definition by a historical definition i mean the sort of definition a secular historian would likely use thi would include any group that develop out of the christian church and continue within the same broad culture some unitarian would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with yet it clear that that group develop from christianity and person from very different background hindu would likely see them a part of christianity thi be not a definition most christian like but it relevant in some political and ethnic context accepting christ a lord and savior be a test use by many christian group for membership the southern baptist and presbyterian church usa i would qualify it by say that what most person have in mind be an exclusive commitment to christ so that someone who accept christ a one of many god would not fit it an attempt to formulate a criterion that be religiou but be not base on technical doctrine by thi definition group such a arian would be view a heretical christian but still christian in the modern context thi would include mormon jw and onenes pentecostal they would be view a heretical christian but still christian in practice i believe just about everyone who fall into thi category would accept the apostle creed the next level be an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition which include all of the major strand of christianity but exclude group that be felt to be outside historic christianity thi be of course a slippery enterprise since catholic could argue that protestant be outside historic christianity etc but i think the most commonly accept definition would be base on something like the nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon the attempt be to characterize doctrine that all major strand of christianity agree be key obviously thi be to some extent a matter of judgement a mormon will regard the ld church a a major strand and thu will not want to include anything that contradict their belief but i think thi definition would have fairly broad acceptance finally some person use definition that i would say be limit to a specific christian tradition some evangelical only consider someone christian if he ha have an evangelical-style conversion experience and some i even hear of group that limit it to their specific church i think you can find context where each of these definition be use a lot be go to depend upon the purpose you use it for if you use it descriptively in history or anthropology you probably use definition or if you use it normatively to say what you believe the christian message be you probably use a definition like or even clh
