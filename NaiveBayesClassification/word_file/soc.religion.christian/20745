from ide twelker steve twelker subject re the arrogance of christian why do we follow god so blindly have you ever ask a physically blind person why he or she follow a see eye dog the answer be quite simple the dog can see and the blind person can not of course you may ask if i can not trust my own sense how do i know whether what i see and hear about god be truth or a lie that be why we need faith to be save we must force ourself to believe that god know the truth and love u enough to share it with u even when it defy what we think we know why would he have create u if he do not love u enough to help u through thi world seem to me if you learn to differentiate between illusion and reality on ymy own you would need to rely on doctrine that need to be update my experience of christianity year be that most christian seek answer from clergyman who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matter and that most of these question can be answer by simple introspection most person suspect that they can not trust their sense but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themself not to get too esoteric but it seem that most religion christianity include be found by particularly intuitive person who understand thi stuff delete a for you no one can convert you you must choose to follow god of ymy own will if you be ever to follow him all we a christian wish to do be share with you the love we have receive from god if you reject that we have to accept ymy decision although we alway keep the offer open to you if you really want to find out why we believe what we believe i can only suggest you try pray for faith read the bible and ask christian about their experience personally and what if the original poster pixie be never convert do it make sense that she or i or the majority of humanity for that matter would go to hell for eternity a many christian believe it make more sense to me that rather than be convert to a centuries-old doctrine that hold no life for her that she simply continue to decide for herself what be best you may be right about christian rely on clergy but i have some reason to hope you not protestant emphasize conversion experience of the holy spirit and use of the bible thi be intend to make sure that christian have religiou experience of their own and that they have some basi on which to judge claim of clergy and other christian i ca speak for catholic and orthodox but i believe they also attempt to avoid have member who simply repeat what they be tell i admit that thi be alway successful we certainly see young person join my church because at that age parent expect it but most of my member do seem quite able and will to make judgement for themself and have a commitment that come out of their own experience unfortunately it the nature of usenet that doctrinal disagreement get emphasize so it look like we spend most of my time deal with doctrine that certainly not my experience of the way christian really live clh
