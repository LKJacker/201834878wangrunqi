from drt david r tucker subject re question jesu alone onenes regarding jesu only believer my moderator write there may be some misunderstand over term here i agree quite likely actually i believe jesu only originally wa in the context of baptism these be folk who believe that baptism should be do with a formula mention only jesu rather than father son and holy spirit thi may have doctrinal implication but a far a i know it do not mean that these folk deny the existence or divinity of the father i not the right one to describe thi theology and in fact i think there may be several include what would classically be call monophysite or arian two rather different view a well a some who have belief that be probably consistent with trinitarian standard but who wo use trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply because it be not biblical clh not biblical what then can they make of the end of matthew and jesu come and say to them all authority in heaven and on earth ha be give to me go therefore and make disciple of all nation baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teach them to obey everything that i have command to you and remember i be with you alway to the end of the age other ancient authority add aman nrsv the note give no sense that thi be emend do other text contradict thi regard baptism or be a misunderstand of the trinity the most likely explanation after all but maybe i simply misunderstand their view is anyone else out there force to read thi group with both a good bible and an unabridged dictionary christianity really be an education in itself david r tucker drt arrgggghhhh when i talk about person who reject trinitarian language a unbiblical i wa speak of trinitarian theology thing like one essense and three person obviously the three-fold baptismal formula be biblical a you point out i normally use the term three-fold in refer to mat while it be certainly consistent with belief in the trinity the trinity be a doctrine whose full formulation occur in the and cent it unlikely that mat have in mind the fully-developed trinitarian doctrine indeed the three-fold baptismal formula be use by some group that do not believe in the trinity the disagreement over baptismal formula occur because of passage such a act which command baptism in the name of jesu there be a couple of other passage in act a well thi leaf u with sort of a problem we command in mat to baptize in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit and in act to baptize in the name of jesu jesu only group baptize in the name of jesu they consider thi consistent with mat because they say that jesu be the name of the father the son and the holy spirit i not the right one to ask to explain what thi mean i will simply say that it do not appear to be normal trinitarian theology it be also an odd way of deal with the idiomatic phrase in the name of those who use the three-fold formula do seem to have a standard answer to the passage talk about baptize in the name of jesu i suspect that the most common explanation be to say that in the name of need not be a verbal formula to say that you baptize in the name of jesu may simply mean that you be do baptism under jesu authority in the cent context it contrast christian baptism with the baptism of john or other jewish baptism of course there a certain parallelism between these passage that suggest that we could just a well say that mat do require the specific three-fold formula to be use in baptism but simply characterize baptism do by those who follow the father son and holy spirit one might well suspect that in the early church more than one baptismal formula wa use so long a we consider follow jesu to be the same a follow the father son and holy spirit no great damage would be do by such a difference thi do not mean that i think we should go back to use both formula baptism be one of the few thing that almost all christian group now recognize mutually so i do not think do something to upset that would be in the interest of the gospel thi be reinforce by the fact that those group that actually use in the name of jesu now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine but a i say before i not the one to explain what their doctrine be clh
