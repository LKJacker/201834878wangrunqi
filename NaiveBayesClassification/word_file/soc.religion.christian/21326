from news subject re what wa the immaculate conception in article todd write ymy roommate be correct the immaculate conception refer to the conception of mary in her mother womb okay now that we define the immaculate conception doctrine would it be possible for those more knowledgeable in the area to give the biblically or other support for it i attempt to come to term with it previously in an attempt to understand it for learn purpose and have be able to grasp the reason it wa a gift from god i think basically the reason wa that the tradition in the church hold that mary wa also without sin a wa jesu a the tenet of faith develop particularly with augustine sin wa more and more equate with sex and thu mary wa assume to be a virgin for life since she never sin and since she wa the spouse of god etc since we also have thi notion of original sin ie that man be bear with a predisposition to sin and since mary do not have thi predisposition because she do not ever sin she do have original sin when science discover the proces of conception the next step wa to assume that mary wa conceive without original sin the immaculate conception mary at that time appear to a girl name bernadette at lourde she refer to herself a the immaculate conception since a nine year old would have no way of know about the doctrine the apparition wa deem to be true and it seal the case for the doctrine rc hold that all revelation come from two equally important source that be sacred scripture and holy tradition in thi case mostly tradition joe moore
