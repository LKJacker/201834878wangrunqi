from kilroy dr nancy sweetie subject certainty and arrogance dean velasco quote a letter from jame m stowell president of moody bible institute the other day i wa at the dry cleaner and the radio wa play it catch my attention because a talk show guest wa criticize evangelical christian say we believe in absolute and think we be the only one who know what the absolute be we affirm the absolute of scripture not because we be arrogant moralist but because we believe in god who be truth who ha reveal hi truth in hi word and therefore we hold a preciou the strategic importance of those absolute there ha be a lot of discussion but so far nobody seem to have hit on exactly what the criticism of arrogance be aim at the arrogance be attack be that we think we be the only one who know what the absolute be in short many evangelical claim that they be infallible on the matter of religiou text in particular the problem be one of epistemology a a shorthand you can think of epistemology a how do you know that question it turn out be a very trouble one the problem with absolute certainty be that at the bottom at least some of the think go on inside ymy own head unles you can be certain that everything which happen in ymy head be infallible the reason you do to discover a source of truth be in question and that mean you do not have absolute justification for ymy source of authority which mean you do not have absolute certainty let take the specific example of biblical inerrancy and a fictional inerrantist name zeke the follow argument apply to the idea of papal infallibility too zeke ha we presume spend some time study the bible and history and several other topic he ha conclude base on all these study and possibly some religiou experience that the bible be a source of absolute truth he may be correct but even if he be he can not be certain that he be correct hi conclusion depend on how well he study history he may have make mistake and the reference he use may have contain mistake hi conclusion depend on how well he study the bible he may have make mistake hi conclusion depend on hi own reason and he may have make mistake noticing a common thread yet everything about hi study of the world that he do everything that happen in hi own head be limit by hi own think no matter what he do to try and cover hi mistake he can never be certain of hi own infallibility a long a any part of the belief be base on hi own reason that belief can not be consider absolutely certain zeke believe that he ha find a source of absolute truth but that belief be only a good a the quality of the search he make for it unles he can say that hi own reason be flawles hi conclusion be in doubt any belief that you hold about absolute source of truth depend in part on ymy own think there be no way out of the loop only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all hi belief thi be easy to demonstrate let go back to my shorthand method of do epistemology how do you know imagine a hypothetical discussion a the bible be a source of absolute truth b how do you know a i study history and the bible and religiou write and church teach and come to thi conclusion b how do you know you study history correctly a well i double-check everything b how do you know you double-check correctly a well i compare my answer with some smart person and we agree b just because some smart guy believe something that do mean it be true how do you know they study it correctly a and a you see b will eventually get a to the point where he ha to say i ca prove that there be no mistake and a long a you may have make a mistake then you can not be absolutely certain there be no way out of the loop thi be where the arrogance of christian arise many person believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrine of christianity they be implicitly claim that they be infallible and that there be no possibility of mistake claiming that you can not have make a mistake and that ymy think ha lead you to a flawles conclusion be pretty arrogant person who want to see thi argument explain in great detail should try to find the infallibility of the church by george salmon he be attack the idea that the pope can be knowably infallible and he do so very well but the general argument apply equally well to the idea that the bible be knowably inerrant darren f provine kilroy at the core of all well-founded belief ly belief that be unfounded ludwig wittgenstein
