of comfort and those of u who be fight for the right to life of the preborn or battle social evil such a pornography or crime be begin to appreciate what an important weapon god ha entrust to u in the imprecatory psalm the imprecatory psalm early in my christian walk i encounter the prayer for judgement in the psalm and wa quite at los to know how to respond to them prayer such a break the arm of the wicked and evil man call him to account for hi wickednes psalm do not seem consistent with the gospel of love which i have accept yet psalm wa clearly motivate by love for god the lord be king for ever and ever the nation will perish from hi land and why do the wicked man revile god and by love for the innocent who suffer you hear o lord the desire of the afflict you encourage them and you listen to their cry defend the fatherles and oppress in order that man who be of the earth may terrify no more nevertheles i grow increasingly uncomfortable read such graphic prayer for god to judge the wicked a pmy out ymy wrath on them let ymy fierce anger overtake them o lord the god avenge o god who avenge shine forth rise up o judge of the earth pay back to the proud what they deserve break the tooth in their mouth o god let them vanish like water let their arrow be blunt the righteou will be glad when they be avenge when they bathe their foot in the blood of the wicked then man will way

and against hi enemy the psalmist describe the target of these imprecation a those who devise injustice in their heart and whose hand mete out violence those who boast of evil and be a disgrace in the eye of god ymy tongue plot destruction it be like a sharpen razor and you who practise deceit you love evil rather than good falsehood rather than speak the truth they crush ymy person they slay the widow and the alien they murder the fatherles with cunning they conspire against ymy person they plot against those you cherish you hate all who do wrong you destroy those who tell ly bloodthirsty and deceitful man the lord abhor to those unrepentant enemy of god the psalmist declare surely god will bring you down to everlasting ruin surely god will crush the head of hi enemy of those who go on in their sin and the purpose of these prayer for justice be declare then it will be know to the end of the earth that god rule to proclaim the power of god all king will bow down to him and all nation will serve him who know the power of ymy anger for ymy wrath be a great a the fear that be due you yet despite the fact that of the psalm include imprecation prayer invoke god righteou judgement upon

and so do my lord matt what then should my attitude toward the imprecatory psalm be should we be pray the psalm to tackle these thorny issue i would like to present a short summary of an excellent book war psalm of the prince of peace lesson from the imprecatory psalm by jame e adam publish by the presbyterian and reformed publishing company my lord jesu christ hi apostle use the psalm constantly in teach man to know god the new testament nt quote the old testament ot over time of all ot quote in the nt be from the psalm christ himself allude to the psalm over time the psalm be the prayer book of the bible are the imprecatory psalm the oracle of god some christian commentator theologian reject these psalm a devilish diabolical unsuited to the church and not god pronouncement of hi wrath on the wicked but the prayer of a man for vengeance on hi enemy just the opposite of jesu teach that we should love my enemy yet tim declare all scripture be god breathe and be useful for teach rebuke correct and train in righteousnes so that the man of god may be thoroughly equip for every good work see also peter the fact that something in the word of god be beyond my comprehension be not grind to deny or even question it inspiration to make ourself the judge of what be good or evil be to impudently take the place of god do we imagine ourself to be holier than god wrong idea of god have lead many to become evangelic plastic surgeon who have make it their job to clean up god word accord to their own idea of what be proper they have forget that it be god alone who must determine what christianity be and what be suitable for hi church the essence of what many have do be to question the authority of god word like eve original sin of listen to satan question ye hath god say the psalm be part of god revelation of himself and hi attribute and they be reaffirm by the nt a the authoritative word of god those imprecatory psalm which these evangelical plastic surgeon reject a unsuited and unworthy for the church be the very psalm christ use to testify about himself eg mark matt and which the apostle use a authoritative scripture eg act act heb see also samuel ch spurgeon say concern the imprecatory psalm especially ps truly thi be one of the hard place of scripture a passage which the soul tremble to read yet it be not our to sit in judgement upon it but to bow my ear to what the lord would speak to u therein the rejection of any part of god word be a rejection of the giver of that word god himself who be pray these psalm christ quote the psalm not merely a prophesy he actually speak the psalm a hi own word the psalm occupy an enormou place in the life of my lord he use it a hi prayer book and song book from the synagogue to the festival and at the last supper on the cro christ quote from the psalm not a some ancient authority that he adapt for hi own use but a hi very own word the word of the lord anointed which a david son he truly wa father into ymy hand i commit my spirit ps my god my god why have you forsake me ps in hi ministry christ foretell what he will say a the judge on the day of judgement and he quote the psalm in do so matt then i will tell them plainly never know you away from me you evildoer ps in heb the apostle attribute ps directly to christ although nowhere in the gospel be christ record a have say these word similarly hebrew attribute ps directly to christ despite there be no record of hi have speak these word while on earth clearly the apostle believe christ be speak in the psalm christ come to establish hi kingdom and to extend hi mercy in all the earth but let u never forget that jesu will come again to execute judgement on the wicked david a the anoint king of the choose person of god wa a prototype of jesu christ act be therefore a prophet he foresee and speak of the resurrection of christ david wa a witnes to christ in hi office in hi lite and in hi word the same word which david speak the future messiah speak through him the prayer of david be pray also by christ or better christ himself pray these psalm through hi forerunner david the imprecatory psalm be expression of the infinite justice of god of hi indignation against wrong do and hi compassion for the wrong but what about the psalm of repentance christ be also the lamb of god the substitutionary sacrifice for my sin christ in the day of hi crucifixion wa charge with the sin of hi person he appropriate to himself those debt for which he have make himself responsible my lord wa the substitution for the sinner he take the sinner place isaiah god make him who have no sin to be sin for u so that in him we might become the righteousnes of god cor in history the psalm especially the imprecatory psalm have be understand to have be the prayer of christ by st augustine jerome ambrose tertullian luther and many other all the psalm be the voice of christ christ be pray the imprecatory psalm all the psalm be messianic it be the lord jesu christ who be pray these prayer of vengeance it be only right for the righteou king of peace to ask god to destroy hi enemy these prayer signal an alarm to all who be still enemy of king jesu hi prayer will be answer god word be reveal upon all who oppose christ anyone who reject god way of forgivenes in the cro of christ will bear the dreadful curse of god he who pray psalm will one day make thi prayer a reality when he declare to those on hi leave depart from me you who be curse into the eternal fire prepare for the devil and hi angel matt all the enemy of the lord need to hear these psalm god kingdom be at war the power of evil will tall and god alone will reign forever with justice he judge and make war out of hi mouth come a sharp sword with which to strike down the nation he will rule them with an iron sceptre he tread the winepres of the fury of the wrath of god almighty king of king and lord of lord rev are jesu prayer contradictory what about jesu command to love my enemy and to bles those who curse u matt christ be of course the love and merciful savimy who forgife sin but he be also the awesome judge who be come in judgement on those who disobey hi gospel god be just he will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who be trouble thi will happen when the lord jesu be reveal from heaven in blaze fire with hi powerful angel he will punish those who do not obey the gospel of my lord jesu they will be punish with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord and from the majesty of hi power on the day he come to be glorify in hi holy person and to be marvel at among au those who have believe thes jesu ha power on earth to forgive sin and he ha power on earth to execute judgement upon hi enemy in the psalm we see both the vengeance and the love ot god even in the in the gospel we see imprecation woe to you hypocrite blind guide blind fool full of greed and self indulgence whitewash tomb you snake you brood of viper how will you escape be condemn to hell matt in matt christ quote from ps and to refer to hi betrayal by juda we also need to acknowledge that christ prayer of bless be not for all in john it be clear that christ be only pray to the elect of god those who have obey ymy word accept god word and have believe see luke those who reject the message of god kingdom will be judge may we pray the imprecatory psalm martin luther point out that when one pray hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be do then he must put all the opposition to thi in one pile and say malediction and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom may they be ruin and tear apart and may all their scheme and wisdom and plan run aground to pray tor the extension of god kingdom be to solicit the destruction of all other kingdom eg dan the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroy it will crush all those kingdom and bring them to an end but it will itself endure forever advance and victory for the church mean defeat and retreat for the kingdom of darknes there be a life death struggle between two kingdom the church can not exclude hatred tor satan kingdom from it love for god kingdom god kingdom can not come without satan kingdom be destroy god will can not be do on earth without the destruction of evil the glory of god demand the destruction of evil instead of be influence by a sickly sentimentalism which insist upon the assume but really non-existent right of man we should focu instead upon the right of god note psalm where the psalmist pray against those who plot together against god and hi person cover their face with shame so that man will seek ymy name o lord do to them a you do to midian a you do to sisera and jabin at the river kishon who perish at endor and become like refuse on the grind the story of sisera in the book of judge chapter and provide a vivid example of god judgement on the wicked sisera cruelly oppress the israelite for twenty year and they cry to the lord for help judge in response to those prayer the lord rout sisera and all hi chariot and army by the sword and sisera abandon hi chariot and flee on foot all the troop of sisera fell by the sword not a man wa leave judge the account then go on to describe how sisera escape to the tent of jael where she lull him into a false sense of safety and then drive a tent peg through hi temple with a hammer the song of victory by deborah and barak celebrate the crush of the head of sisera in graphic detail judge and it be thi that psalm implore god to again do to hi enemy a you do to sisera the bless of obedience and the curse of disobedience the imprecatory psalm be fully consistent with the law of god if you do not

order of the church commander never withhold or change hi word one whose job be to carry dispatch to troop in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dare to amend the general order the
