from rolfe tim rolfe subject re quality of catholic liturgy in jemurray john e murray write i would like the opinion of netter on a subject that ha be bother my wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last few year it seem that there be more and more ad hoc event during mas it drive me crazy the most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition be that what happen be something we all do together because we all know how to do it led by the priest of course which make it a kind of dialogue we present to god but the best mass i be to be participatory prayer having live through the kick and scream in the and a the catholic be invite to participate in the liturgy instead of count their rosary bead during mas i find thi comment interest there be a massively longer tradition for proclaim the passion account without active participation if you know the latin one really beautiful way to hear the passion be it be chant by three deacon the narrator chant in the middle baritone range jesu chant in the ba and other directly quote be handle by a high tenor thi be actually the basi for the common proclamation of the passion that john would prefer but there be alway a judgement call base on pastoral consideration each pastor make hi own decision it be a church-wide conspiracy against participation the palm sunday liturgy with it initial bless and distribution of the palm and procession be already get long before you get to the passion some pastor feel that they should not make the person stand through that long narrative also the orchestrate proclamation with multiple reader and public participation in the crowd quotation run longer than the single-reader proclamation in church with multiple mass for the sunday it might be necessary to go with the briefer option just to get in and get out each parish be different catholic be no longer canonically tie to their geographic parish it be possible that another catholic parish in the columbu area base on the ohio state addres ha a liturgy closer to ymy preference or talk to some of ymy fellow parishioner and see how common ymy preference be pastor generally are will to listen to non-confrontational request though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he react too strongly to the shock of person ask for a longer sunday mas perhap the problem be that recent liturgical development ha follow the continuou evolution model the accumulation of small change no single one of which be too hard to take but rather the punctuate equilibrium model thing stay the same and we get accustom to them then the mark mutation hit my apology if i be mis-remembering the name of the evolutionary theory tim rolfe rolfe rolfe rolfet
