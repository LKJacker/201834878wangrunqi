from ml michael siemon subject re arsenokoitai nt meaning of conviction of sin a meta-exegetical or methodological essay in article rexlex write i ca post it all at once so it will come piece meal and not daily i look forward to read it when i get to the library last week it wa with the object in view to look at some article that have appear over the last few year since my previou look at the literature un fortunately they have move the journal back-issue so i do get a look at the article i wa hop to find i will continue to reserve my own judgment on arsenokoitai until i have see the latest scholarly work and i can hope that rexlex post may give some meat to chew on however what i can do now be to point out the methodological issue what need to be show for anything to be conclude in thi matter if the article rexlex post address these issue so much the better if not you will perhap understand why the problem be hard jame b deyoung write in abstractu thi study argue that paul coin the term arsenokoitai derive it from the lxx of lev cf and use it for homosexual orientation and behavior it be only a minor point but let me make it anyway de young ha already contradict hi own prior assertion in thi abstract that the ancient analysi of these issue wa concern with action and not with orientation i doubt thi will have much bear on the article a such but think i should point it out from the start the hypothesi de young be advance be that paul a coin the word and b hi intend mean for it wa in reference to the levitical law the question i wish to raise be how would one go about confirm the truth of thi hypothesi and what follow if one accept or stipulate for the sake of the discussion that it be correct note that b be independent of a i consider b far more plausible than a which seem merely to be a counsel of despair over find nothing in the literature contemporary with paul to clarify thi word so far a i know paul do not in general invent word anywhere else in hi letter unles you have an otherwise-established pattern of coinage it be not sound methodology to assume it particularly if he gife no hint in the immedi eat text to fix the coinage mean for hi audience a yet the extract present no evidence at all what do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesi which i should say at the outset i find somewhat plausible i certainly know of nothing which make it an impossible way of construe thi problem passage i go to set aside for the moment the question of whether paul might have coin thi usage to look at the more tractable question of what it mean for thi there be in principle two kind of evidence that can be adduce internal and external that be we can look at the text of paul letter for clarification or look outside that to prior or contemporary write that paul might have rely on or to derivative write that have some claim of acces to paul mean the single worst problem with thi word in corinthian be that there is no internal evidence for paul mean he use the word totally without an explanation or hint a to hi mean save that it inclusion in a list of negative imply that it ha for him some negative mean we be leave a the only internal clue with the etymology or formation of the word which be indeed the reason that de young and other before him have associate it with the leviticu prohibition of man verbing with other man where verb be some standard euphemism for have sex lie in leviticu bed in greek one problem be that bedder koitai be not a far a i know used that way in greek therefore i offer one seriou test which de young hypothesi must pa or be reject o find a body of greek text contemporary with paul or not much prior to hi day such that the x-koitai formation imply man who have sex with x obviously the best case be to find such usage of arsenokoitai itself such text would be confirmation that the word can be read that way it be worth emphasize that compound word be not in general under standable by project what the reader may imagine by the juxtaposition of the root existence of such parallel do prove the hypothesi correct but it go a long way toward make such a usage whether or not original with paul in the specific case of x arse n possible of comprehension by hi reader my test move in the direction of external evidence if paul do not in hi text explain hi word and he do not then he ha to expect hi reader to already know the word which stand against it be a coinage or to expect that it mimic word formation that they do know such that they can gues hi mean without too much flounder external evidence that be text other than paul own and lexicographic or consideration that might be adduce then come into the picture if there be other use of the word not dependent on paul which have sufficient internal contextual evidence or some glos by a contemporary scribe to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu ality or similar koitai formation use in similar way then one ha grind for o deny that paul coin the word and o assume that hi reader might understand hi mean do you see the problem if paul coin the word then he require hi reader to share enough context with him to comprehend hi coinage and it intent in thi case that they would stipulate de young gues understand him to be refer to the levitical universal prohibition of male-male sex thi mind you in a context where paul ha emphasize at least to other congregation and so one assume to the corinthian how else to explain cor and the corinthian have to be pull back from overinterpreting their freedom the non applicability of torah law to hi gentile convert among the consideration that make it implausible for paul to have coin the word it first element be archaic arse n be an old attic or ionic form of what in even classical let alone koine time would be assimilate a arre n to me thi imply that we be even more than usually needful of external evidence to pin down mean and usage what be paul do invent a word in obsolete attic formation and if he coin the word but pick it up like the other in hi list a common term of derogation then hi mean will be for hi reader constrain by that common mean since he gife no other i can not emphasize enough that paul do not tell u what he mean by thi word we and hi original reader be guess they at least have a contemporary context and maybe paul have use thi very word and explain it in great detail to them in person but we have no trace of evidence of that and to suppose it be mere fantasy so we be desperately in need of external evidence about thi word and it seem to be exceptionally meagre that be precisely the problem i can think of several more or le equally plausible hypothesis about the word a it wa a standard gutter term of abuse for some or all maybe very specific maybe very general homosexual male activity b it wa a term of abuse use by jew about the awful homosexual greek which may or may not be consciously associate on their part with the leviticu passage c paul invent the term and again there may or may not be an association with leviticu in hi do so he may or may not intend the word to have an explicit and universal application with absolute and clear boundary since none of hi other word in that list have such character thi last seem to me about the least plausible of the hypothesis i advance of these i say off the top of my head that a be most plausible but i still have reservation about that too if the word never appear before paul and in later use ha some evidence of depend on paul then one can opt for paul coin it if it do appear before him he might still have coin it be unaware of prior use in which case hi coinage be inherently confuse but one should normally demote c on the basi of any earlier use especially if they can be show to have be at all common in the place paul travel in either of the a or b case one ha to take into account paul relation to the community of usage he pick the word up from and whether it be from the greek or jewish community paul relation be hardly straight forward there be so far a i have yet see little or no external evidence to aid u in select one of these or some other hypothesi ymy gues be a good a mine or maybe worse or maybe better depend on a lot of thing but it remain so far guesswork and i do know about you but i for one will not equate human guesswork with the will of god by all mean be convince in ymy own conscience about what paul be get at a he say elsewhere on what wa in hi day a major controversy of somewhat thi same character roman hold on to ymy own belief a between yourself and god and consider the man fortunate who can make hi decision without go against hi conscience but anybody who eat in a state of doubt be condemn because he be not in good faith and every act do in bad faith be a sin for my part i can not see any way to resolve paul mean in the use of arsenokoitai without directly applicable external evidence and by the nature of such external evidence it will never reach to certainty of constrain paul own intent paul like humpty dumpty and me and all the rest of u will use word in way that be personal choice and sometime leave hi reader puzzle if that puzzlement lead you to god it may be bless if it should lead away a some of paul word have lead some person then paul intense communicative effort to contrive hi mean in my soul may have some regretable consequence i have alway find paul to be a fantastically reliable guide if i read him in the large if i can see him lay out hi position in detail and hammer it home time and time again i be much le certain about hi mean in hi many brief and cryptic passage such a thi one in my usual discursive way i have go on at great length about the first of my intend meta-exegetical point what would be need to confirm that paul a coin or b in any case mean the word to mean the same a the leviticu prohibition my second point be to stipulate thi hypo thesi and follow up what it imply for both hi initial reader and for later christian given my verbosity thi will be tomorrow night meditation michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you
