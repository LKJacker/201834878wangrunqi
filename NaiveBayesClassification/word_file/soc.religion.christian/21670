from balsamo antonio l balsamo save the wail subject re hate the sin from scott scott holt subject hate the sin date may gmt hate the sin but love the sinner i hear that quite a bite recently my question be whether that statement be consistent with christianity i would think not hate beget more hate never love if you be question whether or not hat sin be consistent with christianity i ask you to consider the follow scripture roman let love be without hypocrisy hate what be evil cling to what be good what be it that paul through the inspiration of the holy spirit be call u to hate would god call u to do something that would eventually lead to hat my fellow man especially when he command u to do the opposite to love ymy fellow man consider some sin now let apply my hate the sin philosophy and see what happen if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the stronger my hatred of it will become eventually thi hate become so strong that we become disgust with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner that ha not be my experience i not find myself hat anybody a a result of hat the sin that may be in their life a a sinner myself i find myself have more compassion for the person jesu too since the bible teach that he wa tempt in every way that we be be able to have compassion on u when we my tempt and fall jesu be my very example of how to hate the sin but love the sinner in the account of the woman catch in adultery john jesu have compassion on the woman but he also call her to leave her life of sin thi be what it mean to love sinner but hate their sin it mean love them unconditionally while at the same time call them to leave their sin in addition my hatred of the sin often cause u to say and do thing which be take personally by the sinner who often do not even believe what they be do be a sin the blame for thi can not alway be lay at the foot of the christian i have see and be guilty of take offense by someone merely point out my sin and call me to repent of it it wa not unloving for the christian to call me out of sin in fact i believe it wa the most love thing that that person could have do he love me enough to want to spare me the consequence of remain in my sin after enough of thi the sinner begin to hate u they certainly do love u for my constant criticism of their behavior hate build up and drife person away from god thi certainly can not be a good way to build love again i do think that you can lay the blame for thi at the foot of the christian if we have love them a jesu love sinner exemplify in john and the sinner hate u for it then we have do the best we can we will have extend to them the most perfect expression of love and they will have reject it now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner then indeed we will ourself be in sin in the summary of the law christ command u to love god and to love my neighbor he do say anything about hate i would like to encourage you to do a word study on hate in the new testament i really think that you will be surprise in fact if anything he command u to save my criticism for ourself criticism be very different from call a sinner to repent hope thi help in christ tony balsamo name antonio l balsamo company digital equipment corp shrewsbury mas work e-mail balsamo
