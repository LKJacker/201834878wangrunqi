from joe joe senner subject re bmw moa member read thi karr david karr write get the organization to act on it be easy to say but say little about what one really can and should do what the organization actually will do be largely determine by the president and director a far a i can see that what make it so important to vote in an election of officer if i remember right i hear that in the last election only of the member actually cast vote i wonder if the current board and their friend and relative make up of the membership i certainly plan on stay with the club long enough to vote and to see the result it do strike me that the bmwmoa be a lot le politically active in the state and national arena not infighting than other organization should we change thi or just join the other group that already be in politic i would support the moa become politically active in that sense the ama already know how to do that and i rather see the moa support the ama in a manner that the ama need i think that more could be accomplish from one strong front rather than two not neccessarily coordinate one joe senner joe austin area ride mailing list ride texa splatterfest mailing list fest
