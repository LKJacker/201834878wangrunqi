from mj mike sixsmith subject re please post egreen ed green pixel cruncher write in article mj mike sixsmith write ed all of u that argue about gyroscope etc throughly understand ed the technique of countersteering me including all the one who think that they countersteer all the way me through a corner ed well all the way through a decreasing-radiu corner anyway maybe they be rid around an ever-decreasing circle of ly which eventually lead to the truth me the official line here though i do have my doubt about it be that the me front brake be apply first follow by the rear brake the idea be me that you avoid lock up the rear after weight transfer take place if that the official line teach in those rider education class you be refer to that also do teach countersteering i have to question the quality of the class me too though unfortunately the official line be the one that you have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence the examiner guideline be lay down by the government and the basic rider education course have no choice but to follow them it surprise me that none of the rider group here either mag or the bmf make much noise about the fact that the rid test require you to ride three foot from the kerb all the time in order to pa that the front brake must be apply before the rear that you have to keep look over ymy shoulder all the time instead of just when it be justify there probably a few more too which i ca think of for the moment if the rid test could be rejigged a bite to include more of the real-world survival skill and le of the woefully simplistic crap that it contain now then the accident figure would imho reduce still further do think we should include countersteering knowledge in my test though
