from thompson paul thompson subject re back breaker near hit write hear screech tire i dart my eye to my mirror and realize it the moroon fly up right behind me in my panic i pop my clutch and stall the bike luckily the guy stop a foot behind my rear wheel i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you really in actuality avoid such an incident suggestion the experience you describe be why i do like to sit with my bike in gear i figure there a chance that i be startle in some way and stall my bike and i figure thi be more likely than the chance that i be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time need to put the bike in gear so i concentrate on avoid situation rather than make split-second evasive manuver i split lane so i not at the end of the line unfortunately thi be not legal in most of the country if i ca split perhap there be room then i will stop near one side of the lane so i have an easy escape and leave my bike in gear until the next car ha stop i watch in my mirror in the mean time to make sure it will whether i really would have time to move should a car fail to stop i have have to find out yet some car have an annoy habbit of race up behind you before brake heavilly so it can be hard to tell if they be plan to brake or not so in summary position yourself for an easy exit and then watch ymy mirror until it all clear paul thompson apple computer
