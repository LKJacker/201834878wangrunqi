from egreen ed green pixel cruncher subject re please post in article mj mike sixsmith write secondly it be the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry and the grind clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacle and not the knowledge of physic between the rider ear are you seriously suggest that countersteering knowledge enable you to corner faster or more competently than you could manage otherwise if he not i will put two rider on identical machine it the one who know what he do and why that will be faster it may be possible to improve ymy technique if you have no idea what it be through trial and error but it be not very effective methodology only by understand the technique of steer a motorcycle can one improve on that technique i hold that thi apply to any human endeavor that all it be an interest bite of knowledge and to claim that it be essential for all biker to know it or that you can corner faster or better a a result be absurd do you consider an understand of the physic of traction absurd are you seriously suggest that one can form a traction management policy without understand what it be or what factor increase or decrease available traction braking it be highly unlikely that any biker be go to develop hi maximum swerve ability without any knowledge of turn technique for most of hi rid life thi may not be a problem but in an emergency situation it be very definately place him at a disadvantage but by include countersteering theory in newbie course we be confuse person unnecessarily right at the time when there be far more important matter for them to learn i disagree the existance and immense succes of rid course which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be teach in a manner that be neither confuse nor detract from any other aspect of the course and that wa my original point perhap but in the ensue discussion you stray far from that point to claim that knowledge of steer technique be irrelevant to a rider ability i find thi assertion ludicrou ed green former ninjaite i wa drink last night with a biker and i show him a picture of you i say dod go on get to know her you like her the grateful dead it seem like the least i could do
