from tobia allen tobia subject re starting trouble in article yau felix chung write i be have trouble start keep run my i have have problem with it since last year but it seem to have subside now it back again problem persist regardles of choke usage pattern gasoline type brand octane and pretty much anything else i can imagine to change the dealer be stump it still under warranty i start the bike it run great for a while second then the engine start to slow down decreasing the idle set will increase the engine speed increasing the choke increase the engine speed regardles the engine will eventually slow down and stop once stop it will not restart even after flood engine drill if i let it sit minute it start beautifully and run great for ever so i go out ride it hard for mile and bring it back ride it easy for a few mile to let it cool down and put it away next day i go thru the same drill to get it go any idea ha anyone see thi before another rider have similiar problem and thi be the mail i send him hope thi help resolve you problem at allen tobia write check the vent tube to the tank sometime the tube be clog or constrict thi prevent ga from flow into the carb because of the vacuum create by the displacement of the gasoline thi be the small tube on the bottom of the tank the large tube be the overflow you will have to remove the leave side tail section to get acces to thi area good luck but if it wa clog would thi interfere with engine operation all the time when it run it run well good point do not catch thi in the original post the only other thing which come to mind since thi be a gravity fee fuel system be thi the fuel petcock valve be vacuum control from the carburator let suppose there be a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel petcock when it be cold the hole be open enough to open the valve just enough to allow ga to the carb with the choke on since the choke create more low pressure in the carb when on to draw ga and a the engine and surround area warm up the hole seal up one way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panel off and remove the fuel hose to the carb connect a tube of the correct size preferably clear tube to observe fuel flow on the output side of the fuel petcock remove the control hose from carburator make sure the tank be full place the valve in the on position and apply vacuum to the control hose preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge to check for air leak with vacuum apply fuel should flow freely to see if there be a vent problem do thi with the fuel filler cap open and close if it flow a lot faster with the filler cap open then there may be something in the vent airway which change position and depend on the position may clog or partially clog the vent i have hear of some fuel tank be replace to fix thi problem so the thing which might be defective be the control hose from carb the petcock valve and possibly the fuel tank vent now if all of the above show no problem of fuel flow when cold then there be something in the carb screw up but there be so many thing to check i would be type all day to list them all here be a few with everything back together apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain hole on the carb one by one to check fuel flow open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clog airway on the carb there be quite a few on each carb i hope something be flush out with all thi trouble shoot if american honda do not resolve thi get mad a hell and report them to the bbb and call the honda customer service hotline it be a number but i do recall it off the top of my head i call just about tire for my and a few day later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrive at home ask how i like the support i receive here would be ymy chance to tell them what you think buy the service manual on the it be an invaluable source of information for work on ymy bike and i might add trouble shoot
