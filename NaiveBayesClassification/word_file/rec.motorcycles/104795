from mj mike sixsmith subject re countersteering to know or not to know what be the question lotto jerry lotto write there ha be a run thread on the need to understand countersteering i have see a lot of opinion but not much of it ha any basi in fact or study the bottom line be the understand and ability to swerve wa essentially absent among the accident-involved rider in the hurt study the average rider do not identify that countersteering alone provide the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themself even after many year of practice i would agree entirely with these three paragraph but do the hurt study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure to swerve in most of the accident and near accident that i see rider will almost alway stand on the brake a hard a they dare simply because the instinct to brake in the face of danger be so strong that it over-ride everything else hard brake and swerve tend to be mutually exclusive manouvre do hurt draw any conclusion on which one be generally preferable
