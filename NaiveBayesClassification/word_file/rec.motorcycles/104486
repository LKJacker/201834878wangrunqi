from mj mike sixsmith subject re please post egreen ed green pixel cruncher write in article mj mike sixsmith write egreen ed green pixel cruncher write all of u that argue about gyroscope etc throughly understand the technique of countersteering including all the one who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner the underlie physic be a different matter and need not be teach to beginner agreed countersteering the technique should be teach for only with understand of the technique can one develop maximally effective emergency avoidance manuver thi be really the only thing we disagree on maybe we should agree to disagree i still think that tell newby to steer leave to turn to the right be unnecessarily confuse when they do it anyway if they just get on the bike and ride the damn thing i know exactly what happen it those other git that have a clue me too understanding the physic of traction be fine but i can not see how detail theory like that ha any place in a motorcyle train course all you need to know be that maximum traction be obtain with the tyre just begin to slide against the road then we be in violent disagreement while what you state be true it be insufficient to form a traction management policy available traction increase with apply normal force ie traction available to the front wheel increase a weight shift under brake force and correspondingly decrease at the rear thu a technique of apply both brake and ease off the rear and increase pressure on the front can best be learn with an understand of weight shift and available traction jeez ed when you start talk about traction management policy i think you be make some weird reference to look after railway locomotive the official line here though i do have my doubt about it be that the front brake be apply first follow by the rear brake the idea be that you avoid lock up the rear after weight transfer take place in practice i suspect most person do what you describe saying brake until the tire just begin to slide be next to useles advice to a newbie he ha to go out and slide the tire to find out where that be it also gife him zero information from which to develop a brake technique that change a the brake and correspond weight shift develop if you do slide the tyre you have no way of know whether you achieve maximum brake or not i not suggest that you should alway aim to brake a hard a you possibly can but if you want to find the limit of the machine you have to go beyond them in any case for maximum brake if a i suggest you aim to keep both wheel just on the point of slide then you be do exactly a you suggest
