from jlevine jody levine subject re please post in article karr david karr write in article mj mike sixsmith write no no no no all i be say be that you do even need to tell person the technique of countersteering co they will do it intuitively the first time they try to go round a corner some will and other will steer with their tuchuse i do know how much the teach of countersteering in the beginner course really help the tuchu steerer i wa one i gues that i alway steer a bicycle that way and i only get the hang of countersteering in normal rid after the course i could do the countersteering swerve in the course no problem but i only start use it in my normal rid when i decide that my turn at speed off-ramp and the like wa a lot more difficult that it should have be i know how it work although that currently up for debate definitely know that it work a i could do it in swerve but only figure it out later in my normal rid just a datum point i think that it not a bad idea to bring the idea up but it best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first lesson or two so they can learn to shift gear before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique countersteering in fact my experienced rider course instructor claim that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike turn to whichever side they want just by shift their weight around even when the operator wa try to turn in the opposite direction i admit i never actually see thi i have in my beginner course we have passenger train sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike and the student would take him for a ride if the student do not give the instructor the you be a sack of potato passenger speech the instructor would steer the bike and make a general nuisance of himself it wa amuse to watch i just happy that it do happen to me i bike like jody levine dod kv get a you can if you pf ride it toronto ontario canada
