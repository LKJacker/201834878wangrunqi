from thompson paul thompson subject ticket advice be worth what you pay i ca think of another subject that generate a much contradictory advice a traffic law and their enforcement everybody get an opinion and be dead certain they be right yet acurate information be extremely difficult to come by the dmv do know cop do know ymy traffic school instructor do know the vehicle code only tell part of the story judge choose to interpret the law in a wide variety of way and the public at large i seldom hear any advice that do disagree with something i experience if you do believe me i suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code study it and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really happen read fight ymy ticket too but do mi the little section at the end where it say ymy chance be lousy and you basically screw a you may have guess i pretty down on the system here in californium i carefully prepare for court bring witness and reveal seriou hole in the officer story only to be slap with the maximum allowable fine plu assessment of over the message clear that the judge do not appreciate john q public try hi own case so here my advice when you find yourself with a ticket take traffic school if you can if it a seriou matter get a lawyer a lawyer can present the exact same case a you the difference be the sentence paul thompson apple computer
