from andersen stephen andersen subject riding jacket recommendation my old jacket be about to bite the dust so i in the market for a new rid jacket i look for recommendation for a suitable replacement i would like to buy a full aerostich suit but i ca afford for it right now i consider two basic option buy the aerostich jacket only dunno how much it cost due to recent price increase but i imagine over that may be push my limit advantage include the fact that i can later add the pant and that it nearly eliminate the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit buy some kind of leather jacket i like a few of the new hein-gericke firstgear line however they may be a bite pricey unles i can work some sort of deal advantage of leather be potentially slightly better protection enhance pose value we all know how important that be possibly cheaper than upper aerostich requirement for a jacket be that it must fit over a few other layer mainly a size thing if leather i prefer a zip-out line it must have some body armor similar to aerostich elbow shoulder forearm possibly protection etc a reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice ventilation would be a plu however it must be wearable in cold weather below freeze with layer or perhap electric please fire away with suggestion comment etc steve steve andersen dod andersen andersen ducatus yamaha life be simply a consequence of the complexity of carbon chemistry
