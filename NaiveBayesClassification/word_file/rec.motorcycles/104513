from klf franklinkl subject re hell-met in article lloyd carr write in a previou article maven norman hamer say if i do end up replace it in the real near future would i do better to wear my totally nondamaged face dot-rated cheapie which do fit a well or keep out the wind a well or wear the shoei which be a lot more comfortable keep the wind out better be quieter but might have some minor damage wear the even after a few drop paint chip it be far better than no helmet or a poorly fit one i have many scratch bang which have be repair plu i still confident of the protection the helmet will continue to give me only when you actually see depression or actual crack use a magnify glas should you consider replacement thi be not good advice a couple of year i wa involve in a low-speed getoff in which i land on my back on the pavement my head helmeted hit the pavement with a clunk leave a couple of ding and chip in the paint at the point of impact but no other visible damage i call the helmet manufacturer and inquire about damage they say that the way a fiberglas shell work be to first give then delaminate then crack thi be the way fiberglas serve to spread the force of the impact over a wider area after the fiberglas ha do it thing the crushable foam liner take care of absorb hopefully the remain impact force they tell me that the second stage of fiberglas functionality delamination of the layer can occur with no visible sign either inside or outside of the helmet they suggest that i send them the helmet and they would inspect it include x-raying i do so they send back the helmet with a letter state that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection i suspect that thi letter would eliminate their be able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event i be to sue them the bottom line though be that it appear that a helmet integrity can be compromise with no visible sign the only way to know for sure be to send it back and have it inspect note that some helmet manufacturer provide inspection service and some do not another point to consider when purchase a lid ken franklin they say there a heaven for person who wait ama and some say it better but i say it ai gwrra i rather laugh with the sinner than cry with the saint dod the sinner be lot more fun only the good die young
