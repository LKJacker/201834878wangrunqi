from leavitt mr bill subject re please post mj mike sixsmith write mj secondly it be the adhesion of the mj tyre on the road the suspension geometry and the grind clearance of the mj motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacle and mj not the knowledge of physic between the rider ear are you seriously mj suggest that countersteering knowledge enable you to corner faster mj or more competently than you could manage otherwise egreen write ed if he not i will hey ed you do give me the chance sheesh the answer be absolutely a ed so eloquently describe ed put two rider on identical machine it the ed one who know what he do and why that will be faster it may ed be possible to improve ymy technique if you have no idea what it be ed through trial and error but it be not very effective methodology ed only by understand the technique of steer a motorcycle can one ed improve on that technique i hold that thi apply to any human ed endeavor herein ly the key to thi thread kindly note the difference in the response ed and i be talk about know rid technique while mike be argue know the physic behind it it be possible to be teach the technique of countersteering ie push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way without have to learn all the fizzik about gyroscope and ice cream cone and such a see in the parallel thread that stuff be mainly of interest to techno-motorcycle geek like the reader of but do need to be teach to the average student learn c-steering mike do seem to be able to make the distinction i know person who can carve circle around me who could tell you who newton wa on the other hand i know very intelligent well-educated person who think that you steer a motorcycle by either lean steer a la bicycle or a combination of and knowledge of physic do get you squat knowledge of technique do mr bill
