hyatt regency crystal city virginium edt the president thank you very much the speech that octaviu give say more than anything i will be able to say today about why it important to give all of my young person a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn to merge the nature of learn and work why it important to honor the effort of person like jerry levin and nancye comb and pat irving and all of those who be here i want to thank the secretary of labor and education and all the person who work with them for sponsor thi and my good friend governor wilder for be here and for speak and all of the busines and local community leader from the city and county and state level from around america who be here thi ha be a pretty fun day laughter i love hear the young person sing it wa music to my ear because it be their future that we be really struggle about applause a year and a half ago i begin the quest to seek the presidency because i wa concern about their future because i believe that my country which have alway be a beacon of hope for the young have too little opportunity wa too divide among ourself acros line of income and race and region and other way without a vision to take u into the future i enter with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of my person but in the proces we might recreate the best of america community know that together we could alway to more than we could individually and that we might secure my future all of you here today be commit to that the job that jerry levin ha commit time-warner to be symbolic of the commitment make by many of the private sector person who be here and those who be around the country the work that nancye comb do and the success of all the young person like those on thi stage and especially the eloquent statement octaviu jeffer all those thing show that together we know what we need to do and we on the right track last july when i wa travel acros america heartland in my luxuriou bu i visit seneca high school in louisville kentucky and there i meet young person and busines person who be participate in the louisville education and employment partnership i saw what nancye comb talk about today i saw how the young person be make an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work i saw a i have see many time in my own state the principle illustrate that octaviu ha talk about that for million of american young person it be really an impediment to both their learn and their ability to be good worker to draw a sharp divide line between what be work and what be learn in the world in which we be live the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight time in a lifetime we must learn to merge the work world and the learn world much better and we must determine that all of my young person see the opportunity that some of them have have showcased here today whether you in busines or in government or in education you know that we have a big job to do when it come to build a future that really honestly include opportunity for all of my person there be still a lot of person who say well thing be pretty good here in washington and everything fine the best thing we can do about thi whole thing be nothing they all have job laughter all the person who say that applause they all have health insurance they all have a pretty good education and they all have a pretty secure knowledge that they be okay no matter what happen i say that not to be either political or unduly critical but to point out that one of the great challenge of thi age for every advance nation everyone be to fully develop the capacity of all of it person and then find work for them to do all the european country have higher unemployment rate than we do but also stronger support system for the unemployed the japanese unemployment rate ha be go up they go to adopt a stimulu that even if you count it in it most rigorou term be three or fmy time bigger than the one that i have propose to create job in west germany alone the unemployment rate be now about a high a our thi be a big problem for advance nation it cost a lot of money to add an extra employee with a lot of pressure from low-wage producer in other country that be grow their own economy and try to provide new opportunity for their person but it be especially important for america for two reason one be we have a whole lot of folk who unles we move aggressively will not have the education and skill we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like thi the second be even if we educate them all if there be job they will be rob of the fruit of their educational labor person need to be able to work in thi country applause we have alway have some unemployment and indeed some of it be normal you alway get some person leave job and move around the country and do first one thing and another we have now at thi moment in my history the necessity for all big organization include the government to reexamine the way they be organize and who ask whether there be too many person work at some kind of job but in the whole we must still be able to create job in a country like america to provide person with the chance to work it go to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposal that i will make to congres in the next couple of month it go to be hard for me to make those work if at the end of all thi work to get off welfare there be a job applause so we have two task one be to develop the capacity of the american person to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstance of their birth the other be to make sure that there be some opportunity for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be reward with a paycheck it be a great challenge i do not pretend that all of the answer be simple but i know if you want to ask the american person all of them to be more responsible if you want to recreate a sense of community in thi country that bridge the line of race and income and region you have get to have opportunity in that mix a part of my vision for america ha to be a future for every young person in thi country who will to play by the rule and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow there ha to be something at the end of that rainbow and that be what we be basically here to talk about today what can we all do a partner recognize none of u can do it alone to develop the capacity of my person to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background and then what can we do to make sure that there something there for them to do the summer job program we discuss today be an integral part of that plan because it will promote the value of work and opportunity and fairnes community it will put the person first and it do have a partnership between the public and private sector i say when i address the united state congres in february on thi program that i would seek to create about extra summer job from government source and then challenge the american busines community to meet that target so that we can create more than a million new summer job over and above what have be create before many many person have respond to that challenge and jerry be just a shin example of that which ha be replicate in thi room and around the country person who be go to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young person a work experience and it be terribly important i want to emphasize that thi summer job program be part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the american person from retrain defense worker who lose their job and other adult who need to acquire new skill to improve the transition from school to work for young person who do go to college but do need at least two year of post-high school train either on the job or in a community college or a vocational set so that they can be competitive worker make it possible for more person to go on to college who do want to go all these thing be part and parcel of a comprehensive plan it also important a i say that we create more job the emergency job program that i ask the congres to adopt would create a half a million extra job over the next year and a half and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent it would also enable u to absorb more young person come into the work force in job that otherwise will not be create it also will help a lot of city and county to invest in thing that need to be do at the grass-root level project long delay water project sewer project park project new industry and particularly in small and medium-size community a whole range of thing that will improve the economy and improve the environment the summer job program be an important part of that because we have try for the first time through the work of the labor department and the education department and through reach out to person like you to make thi more than just a one-shot summer job program to integrate it with private sector effort to hopefully replicate it in each come summer to move these young person into further educational opportunity and to further job opportunity and to have a strong meaningful education component to these summer job something that the united state government ha never fully emphasize before a lot of these young person a you well know because they come from difficult background because they go to school in difficult and challenge circumstance need extra help in build their basic skill in math and language reason and in other area and a lot of educational study show that young person who have difficulty in school often forget a much a percent of what they learn over the summer and then that ha to be repeat the next year what we be try to do here be to give person the opportunity to learn good work habit and to reinforce their learn skill and to put them together and then hopefully over the next couple of year if my entire program pas to give every school in thi country the opportunity to have a good work and learn environment there will be more apply academic more opportunity for person to learn and work during the school year so that thi will not simply be an isolate moment for these young folk but will be a part of build a whole new educational experience a whole new work experience and move on a pathway to a better future the summer job program be not design to be make work job they design to make a future for the person hold the job and that what they will do in the proces they help to build local community to strengthen local economy to solve local problem real job renovate house repair public build do clerical work provide nurse assistance in hospital supervise and train child at child care center and learn all the way challenging young person to learn while they earn but let them earn you know it very difficult to make a case to person who have never see opportunity on their own street that they should do thi that or the other thing if there no evidence of the opportunity that at the end of the effort i have not be spar in go for the last year-and-a-half into place where it be exactly popular to say it and say i want to reform the welfare system i want to toughen child support i want to require person to work i wa sick and tire of person be irresponsible in the use of gun on the street and i want to change all that but if you go to summon person to greater responsibility you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity applause the young person we propose to put to work under my program will spend hour learn basic skill such a math read write either on the job in the classroom they will stretch their mind a well a work up a sweat they will have a sense of accomplishment it will literally be a summer challenge but a challenge that will take them into a different life so i want to ask all of you to support thi effort even a i a ymy president support ymy effort at the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young person who participate we see whether they instead of fall behind over the summer academically a too many young person do they stay even or move ahead i suspect that they will thi summer secretary reich and secretary riley and i will be visit many of ymy community we really try to learn from you which of these effort be work what we should do next summer how we can build it in to what go on during the school year how we can build in my job train effort and the work that we do with ymy company to make sense of thi whole thing so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and ymy private investment a well we want to honor the company and the community the busines leader and the young person who do the very best job thi summer and again i want to say to all of you in private busines who have match my effort i thank you and to all of you who have and those acros the country who may listen or learn about thi event today i want to implore other private employer to stretch a little bite to give other young person a chance to work thi summer i tell you we can not go through another year when we do give these child anything to say ye to if we exhort them to do right we get to be able to reward them applause when the other speaker be talk i wa sit up here on the platform listen and revel and they get talk about work and i get to think about all the different thing i do to make a live in my life when i wa i make a very foolish short-term busines investment i set up a comic book stand and sell two trunk full of comic book made more money than i have ever have in my life but if i have save those trunk they be worth today laughter that do not mean young person should not be entrepreneurial it just mean that you ca foresee a generation ahead i have mow yard and clear land and build house and work in body shop and the part department of a car dealership and i do a lot of different thing for a live some person say i get into politic to escape work laughter i learn something from every job i ever have but i grow up in a generation where i literally do not know a live soul without regard to race or income who want to work who do have a job i grow up in a generation when all you have to really say to person be get an education and you be all right you get a job and you make more money next year than you do thi year now i live in a generation full of person most of whom do make any more money in real dollar than they do year ago and they work longer hour and they pay more for the basic of life and we be now wonder whether we can create the job that these young person want now i want to close by reemphasizing these two thing it do matter what kind of economic policy thi administration pursue or how much productivity increase there be in the private sector if young american do get a good education do learn how to work and ca be productive those job will not be create in thi country machine will do the work or the work will be do off-shore by person who have the same skill level and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wage so nothing we can do economically will matter unles we build the skill and capacity of america work force and anybody that pretend otherwise be just kid on the other hand we need to be honest every wealthy country in the world include the united state be have difficulty create job if i know everything that need to be do i be glad to tell you and we could just call off the whole deliberation of congres and everything else i do have all the answer but i know thi doing nothing be not the answer applause and so the job program that i have present to congres with the summer job with the money for the city and the county through the community development program with the infrastructure money be a small part of a big budget it be an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not with the economy recover in term of corporate profit we can give a little boost to it give opportunity to young person create a half a million job and maybe get the engine go again most of the job in thi program be go to be job in the private sector not government job even though it government money and the lion share of the work in rebuild the american economy obviously will come from the private sector that the kind of system we have and it work pretty well but thi be the challenge we have so i ask all of you here today to support the summer job program to ask ymy friend and neighbor to support it to go back home and ask ymy employer to make a little extra effort to do what you can to help me pa the fund to create the job that the united state government should create thi summer so that together we can have thi partnership because more than anything else we have to give a future a future that my young person can believe in we need to send them a message that here in america if you study hard and work hard if you obey the law and contribute something to ymy community you will be reward by ymy country you can build a future from you own dream that ha alway be the promise of america together that what thi summer of challenge need to be a reaffirmation of the promise of america for so many young person to whom that promise ha be an illusion we can make it a reality thank you very much applause edt
