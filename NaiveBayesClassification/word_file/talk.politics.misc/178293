without an educate work force we ca grow thi economy or remain competitive and recognize that we all have to work together busines and government labor and educator to make thing happen thi satellite town meet be a good example of that kind of work together and if you forgive me a little home state pride i want to say a special word of thank to the wal-mart corporation headquarter in bentonville

and increase my investment and put my person first so that we can compete in the world we here to talk about that tonight about what we can do to educate and train my person better unles we do that none of the effort that all the rest of u make in government even to bring the budget into balance even to increase my investment in other thing which will grow job will last in the long run we also have to have person who can carry their load and in a world where the average young person will change job seven or eight time in a lifetime that begin with the education system and continue into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime it not just important what you know but what you can learn and if i might i like to close just by emphasize we do my best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the labor department and the education department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition and we try to get off to a good start thi summer with a program that would create more than new summer job include many thousand that have a strong education component so my young person can be learn and work at the same time dick i think i ought to stop there that a good place we can begin i think the discussion secretary riley thank you so much mr president each month we get together and talk about way that all citizen can work toward reach the national education goal and tonight we focu on goal five and how community such a your can prepare student for thi world of work thi week the education department and the labor department be host a conference here in washington call summer challenge a program of work and learn to america youth the aim be to use some special fund from president clinton propose economic stimulu package to provide educationally-enriched job and summer school program for young person in disadvantage area of the country mr president let talk a minute you allude to it somewhat about the summer youth challenge ymy program call for more educational enrichment in the summer job and why in ymy word be that so important the president i think it important for two reason first of all a lot of the young person we try to reach may have have trouble adjust to school and learn and while we want them to have a good experience with a real job we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kid that have trouble learn in school may forget a much a percent of what they learn the previou year over the summertime and that be a very unproductive thing for school to have to take up a lot of time teach what they already teach before secondly we want to help these young person progress not only in term of work but in term of learn we want to abolish the artificial divide line between what be work and what be learn because we think that the best and most productive worker will have to be lifetime learner and we think that thi experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young person to succeed in school or at work or in college a they go on secretary riley well i think the fact that these be disadvantage kid that gap that lag you mention a they go into the next year be really even greater secretary reich of course you have train program throughout the year and i wonder be you have any comment about thi educational component of train secretary reich well what we learn mr secretary be that for many young person whether it for the summer or for the year actually on-the-job work experience combine with education be one of the best way of learn many young person for example have a lot they have a difficult time learn geometry but when they actually be there build something or work on something and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry they understand what it use for and a lot of young person just that sense of connection between education and the world of work be terribly terribly important it important during the summer but it important for a lot of young person even beyond the summer secretary riley thank you mr president you call for a youth apprenticeship program school-to-work transition and i wonder if you would tell u a little bite about ymy concept of that and how you see it develop the president well first of all let talk about why it important most new job that will be create in thi decade will not require a four-year college degree but most of them will require some learn and skill that go well beyond what most person get in a high school diploma if you look at the last year the average salary of young person that have at least two year of good post-high school education wa a good salary that go up over the decade the young person who have le than that tend to have lower wage that do not go up and in many case in real term fell over the decade because they be productive they be more valuable to their employer so we think america ha a big economic interest in try to ensure that all the young person who get out of high school but do go on to college make a transition to work which include two year of further train either in a community college a vocational set or perhap on the job and what i have do in thi budget a you know be to give you and secretary reich some fund and some incentive to try to work in partnership with state and with the private sector to build these program state-by-state in a way that would be customize essentially by the busines community base on the need of the economy in any give area it could revolutionize long-term the quality of the american work force and the earn of american worker secretary reich i should add mr president i think you know thi from ymy experience in arkansa and many of the person watch thi program that the busines community and educator labor group be already in many of my community many of my state build a school-to-work transition program in fact there an awful lot of ferment a lot of excitement the person watch thi program probably be the one who be most directly involve in that and more power to them secretary riley and i be go to do everything we can to build on the success already out there secretary riley bob we go to be talk tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep the co-op learn career academy and what feature all those program that deal with thi subject what be some of the feature that every one of these school-to-work program might have that be important secretary reich well one thing that we see and you and i have be work at thi for a long time and you much longer than i we see that active involvement of the busines community be absolutely essential and i so delight that we do thi in the headquarter of the chamber of commerce the chamber of commerce of the united state be commit to do these kind of program train education retrain and we aim to work very closely with the chamber the busines community be go to be actively engage in develop almost an audit of the kind of job that be need and help the educator community college technical institution develop curriculum that be relevant for the job of the future community have get to come together i mean thi be one of the most important thing you get to have all of these player in a community come together and work together and cooperate together you know too often we have the educator over here and the busines leader over here labor group over here and everybody be talk but they not really work together in a common strategy and the third and final ingredient i would say dick would be a commitment to excellence a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skill development excellence thi be not a track program we talk about for kid who be not go to make it thi be a program that every young person ought to be eligible for if they want to go on beyond that to four-year college that fine that ought to be permissible but we talk about the foundation of learn about job the foundation skill for on-the-job learn and again those be the critical component it already be do the president i think if i might just interject one point base on my personal experience at home the busines community ha a critical role to play not simply in say here be the job skill that be need and here what ought to be teach but also in monitor that excellence if you have the right sort of partnership there the person who be pay the taxe and who be go to then be hire the worker be not go to permit the second-rate program to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them so i think that very important and when we try to if you will fill in the blank at the federal level try to set some standard and provide some fund one of the thing that we want to be sure and do be to make sure that the employer ha a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these program because that really what go to determine whether the whole thing be worthwhile secretary riley that great we be talk of course about school-to-work and also the job and economic recovery program for thi summer and fall but let talk just a moment about long-term school reform it something especially close to me mr president i wonder if you would give u some of ymy idea for the community out here on goal legislation that i think will be come forth before too long the president well a you know back when you and i be both governor we spend a lot of time work on my public school and we try to be very candid with my person in say that a lot of these thing be go to take some time to materialize i have a hand in write the national education goal that the governor draft along with representative of president bush administration back in and what we go to try to do thi year with ymy leadership be to introduce legislation in congres that will actually define the thing that the national government ought to do to try to help the local school and the child of thi country and the adult learner too meet those goal make sure that when by person show up for school ready to learn that we get a percent on-time high school graduation rate that child at the and grade be confident in the subject they suppose to know that they be second to none in math and science that be school be safe discipline and drug-free and of course the fifth goal i take them out of line to say thi the last be that we have a system of life-long learn in thi country and each one of those goal there a national role a state role a school role school district role and a private sector role and what you attempt to do in thi bill you go to introduce with me in the next few week be to define what my job be and then to give the rest of america a way of define what their job be and see whether we actually meet the standard of quality that we need to meet it very excite so far a i know nothing quite like it ha ever be do in the form of federal legislation before not mandate and tell person what they have to do with their money but actually set up a framework for excellence and partnership so that we can do my job i really excite about it secretary riley well i be too and i think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in term of it relationship with state serve a a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform effort all drive by high standard that the point bob let me ask you one question and then we get to the telephone call it about the same subject we have of course skill standard that be go to be part of goal and i wonder if you would comment on that secretary reich well you know we have percent of my young person who do graduate from college very often they do have very many alternative they do have a wonderful system of community college and technical institution but if we have national skill standard to which they could aspire and which employer would understand a a national credential many of these young person would actually find that they be much more eligible for job everybody do have to go to college other country you have smaller proportion of their population go to college but you have a whole level of person who have certain technical preprofessional skill we can do it in thi country if you do go to four-year college you not a loser and we want to develop those national skill standard we go to be work with the state with the education department with a lot of private industry in develop those standard and i think they will be the kind of thing that enable my vocational and technical and other institution to rally around a well a my busines community secretary riley well that great why do we go ahead and go to the telephone we have a call i see mayor bruce todd of austin texa q ye mr president and mr secretary reich and riley we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today we have some dedicate professional and volunteer here in austin who have hear what you have say and be very appreciative let me simply say aman to some of the comment make already we agree with much of the tone that the clinton administration ha take and be very supportive we have be successful here in austin of triple my summer employment program over the last fmy year we expect to have over employ thi year in the summertime perhap a much a with the federal assistance much of the question that we have design you have answer in ymy open comment so we must be think alike but the question essentially involve what initiative after labor day would be appropriate we know summertime be important year-round be even more important and what kind of initiative at the federal level might be propose to meet the need of the youth on a year round basi and perhap more importantly how can family and the local community be more involve use the federal initiative that something that we believe be very important to succes in thi effort secretary riley mr president the president i think i give everybody a chance to answer the question bruce but let me first thank you for call and thank you for all the great work that you do in austin i see some of it and i alway be very impress first with regard to the summer program we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable u to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young person back into school under circumstance that might allow them to do some work in the private sector too we hope that secretary reich be go to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector job to be match with the public sector job thi summer and we work on that secondly in the program that i have present to the congres over the next five year what we be attempt to do be to build in an amount of investment that quite substantial for job train program for school-to-work program all of which give heavy heavy weight to local community input just the question you ask but do provide some federal investment dollar which we hope you can put with local dollar to keep person work and be train on a year-round basi and i will say again to echo what secretary reich say a moment ago to try to break down the barrier between what be see a work and what be see a learn an awful lot of young person actually have quite high iq but actually learn so much better when they do than when they read or just listen so we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent and we hope that if the whole budget pas and we do have budget cut and more than actually in the budget and some revenue raiser and some new money for education and train that we be able to do just what you seem to want base on ymy question bob do you want to say anything secretary reich well you take most of the word out of my mouth mr president a usual but let me just add one thing and that be that one of the most important aspect of post-high school for a lot of young person who be not go on to college in addition to the school-to-work program simply be the availability of job and we get to get thi economy move again obviously it terribly important to get thi recovery program to get the economy back on track that sort of the prerequisite to everything else if we do get the economy back on track we have i think thi be the correct me if i wrong mr president i think be the month we have have seven percent unemployment or greater thi be a jobles recovery a lot of those kid be go to be get out of school in june and even if we do everything right they would have a very very hard time get job secretary riley thank you both of course goal will be a permanent long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year it will involve if pass and we certainly hope it will be action plan with every state where we can be work together to reach for the goal in a number of different way and then the state with all the variou school district a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement and i think everybody will see a great energy out there once we get that move the next call be dr harry heinemann new york doctor q good even mr secretary it be a pleasure to be on with you thi even a you may know bridge the school and work ha be central to la guardium educational program since it inception in the and that include the college the two alternative high school that operate on my campu and the linkage we have forge with the local school we have find thi to be an extremely effective learn strategy and over the year we come to believe that there be several principle that be very important in bridge the school and work and these include integrate theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace with provide all student early exposure to career a well a provide opportunity for them to reflect upon these experience while they strengthen their skill and lastly the critical role of the liberal art particularly in the development of high performance competency my question then be how can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrate with transition to work experience and what mechanism and strategy can you suggest to achieve thi integration secretary riley well thank you very much i think and we get a response from you all on that and very interest work go on there we go to have three person my next guest on the program thi even that will be some specialist in that area that you speak and i certainly pa that on to them and we can discus it later you all care to comment any comment you might have the president i just like to say if i might one thing i want to reemphasize thi and i do think i be a clear about it a i like although i think at least one of the person who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than i i think thi whole concept of apply academic be very important and i think that we have to basically abolish what i consider to be a very artificial distinction between what be vocational learn and what be academic learn i think we should keep the liberal art go i think we should have a strong component for person who be in the vocational program secretary reich it seem to me that we also need to rethink my entire track system because a lot of these school and work combination be important for mainstream student they important for all student it not just a special group of student that need them some of the experiment that i see around the united state dick i sure you see them a well be mainstream experiment they mainstreaming all the student at and grade they give them a combine work and school experience and then a transition program and again the kid can either go on to college if they want they can go on to technical community they can go on to an entirely a large variety of possibility and career direction but we have to get away from the stigmatize that often go on with young person who simply be do job-related or work relate work within the classroom within my school secretary riley thank you very much i think that go to be the last call that we have time for mr president i think you get to move on to another matter and i want to thank you and secretary reich for be here we appreciate ymy time and ymy idea and it be a tremendou help to u edt
