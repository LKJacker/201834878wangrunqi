job and their economic future the federal budget plan pass congres in record time and create a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country then the short-term job plan i present to congres which would create a half a million job in the next two year pass the house of representative two week ago it now ha the support of a majority of the united state senate all of these member of congres know it time to get the economy move again to get job growth go again to get a fast start on the investment we need to build a last prosperity unfortunately a minority of the member of the united state senate have use gridlock tactic to prevent their colleague from work the will of the majority on the job bill when congres return i ask every senator from every state and from both party to remember what be at stake the issue be not politic it person sixteen million of them be look for full-time job and ca find them these man and woman do care about who up or down in washington they care about pay the rent and meet the mortgage payment about put food on the table and buy shoe for their child about regain a sense of dignity that come from do a day work and support their family and draw a paycheck they ask those of u who have the privilege of serve to put aside politic and do something now to move my economy forward i be prepare to do that and i have be work with the senate to come up with an adjust package that meet some of the concern of those who have be block action on the job plan i will to compromise so long a we keep the focu on job keep the focu on growth and keep the focu on meet unmet national need my opponent have be ask for a smaller package today i ask them to join me in determine exactly what kind and what size package congres can approve that actually meet the need of the american person but even a we make those reduction and the package will be smaller i believe we must addres problem that be on the mind of million of american and one in particular and that be the need to toughen law enforcement in my society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime so i will ask even in thi reduce package for an additional million in federal fund to help local community to rehire polouse officer who have be lay off because of the fiscal problem cause by the national recession together with a match effort by local government thi could put a many a polouse officer back on the job and back on the beat in community all acros my nation at a time when too many of my person live in fear of violent crime when too many business have close and too many person have lose their job because person be afraid to leave their home rehiring thousand of officer be one of the best investment america can make and i ask both house of congres to make that investment in my person safety and in their piece of mind i believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy go toward recovery and to create job make no mistake about it i will fight for these priority a hard a i ever have i will never forget that the person send me here to fight for their job their future and for fundamental change i want to thank the polouse officer who be here today and tell you that not a single one of them know before they come here that i have determine to ask for more money in thi job bill to rehire polouse officer they come here because they believe in the summer job portion of the package and i want them to be free to talk about that they come here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they want the kid in thi country to have a chance to have job thi summer to have safer street and a brighter and more peaceful future i say what i say today not just because it good for law enforcement but because it good for the person who live in these community i have alway support community police not only because it help to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate but because it cement better relationship between person in law enforcement and the person that they hire to protect it reduce the chance of abusive action by polouse officer and increase the chance of harmony and safe street at the same time these be the kind of thing that we be try to do i promise in my campaign that i do everything i could to put another polouse officer on the street over the next fmy year thi make a good downpayment on that thi keep in mind the core of the job package and thi will help u to move forward so i ask the person in the senate who have block the job bill let work together i can accept a reduce package if you will increase ymy commitment to safe street i do not accept the fact that we should reduce my commitment to summer job or to build my infrastructure or to do those other thing that will create real and last prosperity for my person i have do my part now to end the gridlock i ask you to do your i want now to give the person who be here with me on the platform a chance to make some remark and to be hear by the american person begin with janet reno the distinguish attorney general q mr president can you tell u do you think that the job package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a vat tax at thi point in the congressional dialogue the president not at all i think it should have they would have any relationship one to the other first of all i make absolutely no decision on that you should know that there a lot of support in the busines community and the labor community person have ask u to consider that because of the enormou burden of the present system on many of my major employer particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate job and to carry the strength of thi economy but i have make absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax q do you personally believe that the american public be ready to pay for to have another tax to pay for health care i mean apart from what busines and labor leader have say the president i not go to speculate on that i will say thi the real issue be how quickly we can recycle the benefit of all the save to cover the cost i mean that be everyone know that if you do what we propose to do if you streamline the insurance system if you fix the system so that there no longer an enormou economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain service if you provide primary and preventive care in place where it be now every single analysi show absolutely massive save to the health care system the real question be whether you can transfer those save to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide person the security i have no idea the poll say that but i do know all i know be the poll that i see in the pres that many of you have commission they say overwhelmingly the american person want the security of an affordable health care system but i do think that ha anything to do with thi stimulu and it certainly should have person want a job first and foremost they want that more than anything else q now that you announce ymy willingnes to compromise on the stimulu package can you tell u what part of ymy package you consider vital and uncompromisable i assume summer job be one the president i want the summer job i want the highway program and i want the polouse program i still intend let me say thi i still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill which do not pa the congres last year thi be a supplement to that not a substitute for it in any way but i think we need to do that i think we need the ryan white fund because of the enormou health care burden to the community that be inordinately and disproportionately affect by the problem of care for person with aid and there be several other thing that i think should be do we have to do the agriculture department meat inspector the safety of the public depend on that there be a number of other thing that i do i do think any of it should be cut but i have give senator mitchell and senator byrd i talk to them and senator dole call me yesterday to discus thi and i tell him that i would call him back i call him back last night in new hampshire and we discuss thi and i basically ask them to talk today and say that i would not make any statement about any specific until at least they have a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord so i do want to be any more specific than i have be already and let see if they can talk it out q when you talk to senator dole and senator mitchell do you tell them about ymy increase also that million that you want that a part of the package the president i do i tell senator i leave word for senator mitchell last night about it when i talk to senator dole i do remember for sure i do not believe i mention it but i do tell him that i wa prepare to reduce the package and i want to break the gridlock and i tell him that i wa work on a reformulation of it so that in the hope that it would become even more focus on job and the kind of issue that i think the american person want u to addres and thi be certainly consistent with that thank you edt
