from stephen subject re ca have it both way news a enemy news a supporter in article walsh mark walsh write from article by stephen now which be it are you go to comdemn national medium then turn around and use it to support some position you present seem somewhat contradictory do it i believe that thi be not contradictory on the basi that the quality of medium report vary greatly base on the subject at hand the medium ha prove itself very accurate be the area of present raw undisputed datum one good example would be the weather page in which high and low temperature of the previou day for a large number of location be post there be little evidence to show that they be in error i believe thi true when we speak of physical datum in the sense of pure science but when we speak of datum that revolve around social science then we have to be careful the american medium ha fail u in it analysi of complex event however i sure that we can come up with many news story that have leave u angry because so many fact have be ommitted case that come to mind be the invasion of panama the war with iraq the disaster in waco the issue surround the acceptance of gay into the military the war on drug and many other i quite agree but these be case or event that contain politic social science information sociology etc and at best be reflection of the group that report them a you have point out it be difficult to report that the temperature wa degree when it wa degree and have person believe you the story that you bring to light wa regard the new sex survey while i sure that due to lazynes some of the datum wa ommitted from the article i would venture to gues that the datum that wa present do not deviate from the survey i do however think that it would be folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter analysi of thi datum in thi particular case there wa little analysi and the reader wa leave to draw own conviction ye and no the survey present accord to mr cramer a value call the median which one use thi make u believe that of the male have plu sex partner and of the male have or le sex partner homosexual be purport to make up only in thi case the majority of person with plu sex partner be heterosexual it be my feel that median wa not the intend word usage but if it be then we have little evidence to support mr cramer claim about gay promiscuity hetero promiscuity many netter mr cramer include often forget that the american medium be merely a number of business who purpose in life be to make money for their owner and stockholder revenue come largely from advertiser who merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar the medium be like fast food the quality of the food or of the report will improve only if the customer demand a such otherwise it be busines a usual very good thi be a point that i have try to bring out and a any network news program will show you it be true the news medium be a busines and a such become skew because of where it loyalty lie there be an old statement by a man and i can not remember him or hi statment exactly but it warn against the merger of busines and news report because of the obviou consequence what master be news go to serve in the end the advertiser and the bia of the news group
