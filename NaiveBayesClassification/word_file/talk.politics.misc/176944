from clinton-hq subject clinton pres briefing by george stephanopoulo the white house office of the pres secretary for immediate release april pres briefing by george stephanopolou the briefing room edt mr stephanopoulo a you know the president be soon to be on hi way on amtrack to camden yard he be throw out the first pitch q it marc the maryland area transit it not amtrack mr stephanopoulo oh it not amtrack well he go from union station you right excuse me q george what exactly be you prepare to do to break the logjam with senate mr stephanopoulo well a you know there be discussion between senator mitchell and senator dole thi morning and i think that the president be go to continue to make the point that he believe that my investment package my job package need to be pass a quickly a possible we need thi investment for summer job for immunization for highway construction for the important program that will put person back to work right away thi summer and the president continue to believe hi program should be pass q will he compromise that the question mr stephanopoulo well a you know the discussion be go on thi morning in the senate betwen senator mitchell and senator dole let see what they come up with but the president believe hi job program should go forward q george would the president be will to accept billion for one year which apparently appear to be the compromise be offer by mr stephanopoulo well i do know what be be offer by either side the senate discussion be go on right now let see what happen today q would he go that far no matter what the republican have offer so far would he go that far billion per year mr stephanopoulo the president believe that hi program should be pass at thi time clearly we go to be will to listen to what the senator might or might not be able to come up with but i not go to get into figure right now let see what happen q it reasonable to assume be it from what ha happen so far that a compromise be go to be necessary in order to get a vote mr stephanopoulo well the republican seem more intrested in stop progress on the president job bill than in do something to create mr stephanopoulo well the republican seem more interest in stop progress on the president job bill than in do something to create real action real job thi summer for the american person i think there no question about that there be some frustration of legislative activity over the last few day q so you need to compromise to get ymy package through mr stephanopoulo we see what happen with the conversation between senator mitchell and senator dole thi morning q prepare to compromise mr stephanopoulo the president prepare to listen to what senator mitchell ha to say thi morning after hi meet with senator dole q do he feel that he ha be defeat in hi mr stephanopoulo not in the least in fact he be very successful so far in the begin of hi term q how mr stephanopoulo he pass hi budget in record time in six week and it a budget which reduce the deficit by billion over five year and it a budget which provide for important investment in my future right now we also have strong passage of hi job program through the house simply because a minority of republican in the senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the president job program be not a sign that he be not succeed overall q he ca beat thi can he q the fact be they can do that mr stephanopoulo well the republican can stop action there no question about that q what be you go to do about it q george what do you know about these allege note take by bori yeltsin during one of the meet in which it appear that the president tell bori yeltsin not to trust the japanese that when they say ye they mean no mr stephanopoulo i think that a complete misread of what happen at the meet the context of the conversation wa that president clinton wa actually reassure president yeltsin at the time about hi conversation with prime minister miyazawa over the kuril island and the prime minister belief that japan would play a constructive role in the proces i mean thi wa a casual comment about japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it wa in the context of a conversation where he wa reassure president yeltsin that he believe the japanese be seriou about their commitment to the proces q are you say that the president say that when the japanese say ye they mean no mr stephanopoulo that not i do know the exact word and there wa a much longer discussion about he do say something along the line that he believe that on thi issue prime minister miyazawa intend to really go forward with the proces q have there be any attempt to explain thi to the japanese because apparently the japanese pres ha pick thi up and there appear to be mr stephanopoulo i see the report in the japanese pres and it actually do put the situation in context it do talk about the japanese understand the japanese point of view i do think it go to be a problem i believe that there may have be some diplomatic context just to clear thing up but i not positive q george wa the specific comment that wa make specific to the kuril island situation or wa it a general observation on japanese etiquette mr stephanopoulo the discussion wa about q the specific comment be what i ask about that ha allege to have be translate from the russian note when the japanese say ye they mean no mr stephanopoulo well it wa a combination i mean i do think that the whole sentence i think that the specific comment wa a broad general observation follow up by a specific finish to the sentence where he say in thi case he believe that prime minister miyazawa mean to keep the commitment q wa he say it facetiously first mr stephanopoulo i think it wa just a casual observation q and then you say diplomatic contact be make to clear it up ha the president send a message mr stephanopoulo no i do think the president speak i believe that secretary christopher ha make some call but i not sure exactly how many q well thi obviously be a bigger deal than you make it out to be if christopher ha have to make some call mr stephanopoulo no no it wa just that we get the report in vancouver and the secretary want to make sure that it wa understand and make sure there wa absolutely no mr stephanopoulo report in vancouver and the secretary want to make sure that it wa understand and make sure there be absolutely no misunderstand and i do believe there be on q what be my position about the japanese that they may have to say one thing but actualy mean another mr stephanopoulo no the position on the japanese be a the president state to president yeltsin throughout the two day he say that he have have a good conversation with prime minister miazawa prior to the summit he reiterate the position the long-standing support for the japanese position on the kuril island but also reiterate prime minister miazawa commitment to move forward on the proces and to play a constructive role and i think president yeltsin wa very glad to hear that q after listen to secretary christopher on iraq for the last few day i a little confuse what be the policy do you want to see saddam hussein overturn mr stephanopoulo it the same policy that secretary christopher ha reiterate and all of the official have reiterate we expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all resolution right now we do not have that compliance q throw it out further that if iraq comply saddam ca stay in office mr stephanopoulo right i think that that my judgment be that it be not possible for saddam hussein to comply with the resolution and stay in power but the important point be that we expect compliance by iraq with all resolution and we will continue to demand it q and be you concern the iran will become the dominant power in the area mr stephanopoulo secretary christopher ha also speak to iran over the last several day and he say we also expect full iranian compliance with all international norm and stop support of terrorism q that a very glib statement that he wo stay in power if he comply with resolution on what logic do you base that mr stephanopoulo right now saddam hussein be not comply with the resolution at all he be not respect the right of hi person a be require by the resolution he be not fully comply with all the resolution regard inspection he be not fully comply with all the resolution regard armament q well when do you think that if he do comply he would be out of power mr stephanopoulo well right now hi power rest on the repression of hi person if he stop do that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power q george back on the stimulu package why be it that you and the president accuse the republican of play pure politic and perpetuate gridlock why be it that what evidence do you have that they just do have a genuine idealogical difference with you that in good faith mr stephanopoulo well the fact that several time in the past the republican many of the one who be now lead the fight for the filibuster have support the very fund they now seek to stop most especially the highway fund q george in regard to that some of the moderate republican say that the white house err by not be more open to them during the while the plan wa put together that they have one sort of proforma meet between the white house and the senate republican and that wa it do the administration look back and think perhap it could have do a better job of work with some mr stephanopoulo well i not sure that it true that there wa only one meet i mean the president meet with the republican leadership on at least two occasion before the introduction of hi package he meet with the entire senate republican caucu also for lunch and go up there we be continually in contact with a many republican a we can find who have an interest in the president package we be interest in what they have to say a well but we believe that thi program be important and we go to continue to fight for it q ymy all or nothing do it with the democrat alone strategy do you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through mr stephanopoulo well i mean i think that there be no question that under the senate rule a determine minority can frustrate activity i mean there be just no question about that you only need plu one to keep go plu one to keep go and to stop any action and that what the republican be do q go to rethink the way you attempt to get other thing pass a you go through thi proces for the rest of the summer q work with republican and try to woo some republican into ymy camp mr stephanopoulo i think we go to continue to look for the support of republican whenever we can get it on the president intiative q but on thi one how be you go to do it differently than you do it on thi one because on thi one you really do stiff the republican from the begin and make it clear that it wa a democratic majority that would get thi through and could get it through and you really do need republican vote are you go to take a different tack when you have to go for particular vote when you have to go through mr stephanopoulo i ca see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road clearly the president go to continue to reach out when he can q you do have any regret then about the way you have handle it up to now and you do plan any change in ymy approach in deal with the republican in congres base on thi experience mr stephanopoulo obviously the president would like hi package pass a quickly a possible and he go to continue to pres for that we will continue to reach out to republican there not question about that and we continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenue for cooperation in thi case the republican have choose to unify around a filibuster around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward q they be deny any other legislative mean of put their proposal forward mr stephanopoulo i think they be q any idea mr stephanopoulo i think their amendment be be defeat i do know that they be deny q to present them mr stephanopoulo that not exactly true i mean they get the vote q that their can be pass though by the parliamentary rule under which they play mr stephanopoulo unles they get a majority in support all the way around no that not exactly true q george one more on iraq is the administration back any of the iraqi opposition grooming any new leadership q back any of the iraqi leadership mr stephanopoulo oh i again we press for iraqi compliance i do know if we can get into the busines of groom leadership i believe there have be some contact at some level with iraqi opposition group i do know about anything recently q jesse jackson who of course be not the president best friend ha however be tell that there be to be some kind of town meet or some kind of involvement by the president pre-empted the ball game lo angele will he consider something like that or any other kind of intervention there mr stephanopoulo well a you know the president appoint commerce secretary ron brown about day ago to be a special envoy to californium and coordiante cabinet activity around the californium economic situation include the situation in lo angele i believe there will also be visit out to lo angele by the education or have be visit by the education secretary mr riley i believe that transportation secretary pena and hud secretary cisnero be also go out and there may be other visit by cabinet official over the next several day and week i would rule out the possibility of a visit by president clinton to californium obviously he be follow the situation closely and be concern about make sure that we make the right long term policy decision that will help create the kind of economic opportunity which help prevent disturbance but we go to continue to watch it q george a a follow-up reverend jackson be also suppose to be outside the ball park today in baltimore with a group of supporter protest the lack of minority in baseball management do the president have a position on that mr stephanopoulo the president ha receive correspondence from reverend jackson i know that reverend jackson ha also speak with the white house chief of staff mack mclarty he clearly raise seriou question there ha be some progress in baseball over the last several year but still not enough but the president intend to continue to go to the ball game q is he go to say anything about it today or see reverend jackson while he out there mr stephanopoulo i do know if he be go to see them but a i say the president believe that reverend jackson ha raise some seriou question and it something that a i say even though there ha be progress it clearly not enough q did reverend jackson ask him not to go to the ball game mr stephanopoulo i not sure about that i believe the characterization the reverend jackson be talk about be an informational pickett i do know that he ask him not to go to the ball game but he send a long detail formal letter outline hi concern with the situation in major league baseball and the president read it q george the oriole be play the ranger the manage partner of the ranger be george w bush is he go to be there and be he go to meet with the president mr stephanopoulo i do know q what be the mubarak schedule mr stephanopoulo i know that president mubarak be come tomorrow morning for a work meet they will have a lunch and i believe that he be have dinner tonight with vice president gore q and joint statement tomorrow mr stephanopoulo i believe so ye at the end ye q is there evidence george that the egyptian do warn the about a potential terrorist bomb terrorist activity mr stephanopoulo a report in the new york time i mean i think that president mubarak do say that there ha be general conversation with the egyptian a there have be for a long period of time we do have general intelligence share i mean but president mubarak wa very careful to point out that there wa no specific information on thi visit that wa pass forward the president will continue to investigate the situation but he also reiterate hi belief that we can not tolerate terrorism of any kind q george he do make specific or the egyptian apparently do issue specific warn about thi individual who forgive me thi individual who forgive me the name escape me at the moment and say the egyptian be more or le rebuff in their attempt to get some kind of action mr stephanopoulo again i do know if i would agree with ymy characterization of the mubarak interview he do say that they give general warn about the possibility of a network in the united state and upon which we take appropriate action but there wa no specific information on thi specific operation at all q so the white house do feel that any of the law enforcement agency whether it be the cium or fbi who would have receive thi kind of information wa lax or derelict in it duty in not pursue some kind of mr stephanopoulo no not at all q what next with serbium it get only a pass mention in the news conference yesterday mr stephanopoulo you do get to ask ymy question q ye exactly wa there any agreement on concert action between the two country and even if there wa what do the do next mr stephanopoulo i think the be clearly go to move forward in the today continue discussion with my ally on a sanction resolution and we continue to look for way to pres the serbian to come to the negotiate table and sign an agreement q george why do you think sanction be still an option i mean the serbian make it clear that at least the leadership be survive just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration official we have in the other day say there no evidence that they go to have an effect any time soon the bosnian serb have say no to the peace plan when do no mean no and you have to do something different mr stephanopoulo well i mean we be do something different we move forward on further sanction through the and those discussion will continue we go to continue to try and tighten the noose on serbium and i think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time q are we look again at lift the arm embargo mr stephanopoulo the president ha say that thi be something that be under consideration q george do you have any more on hugh rodham condition how he do mr stephanopoulo a far a i know nothing change q george week after mr mubarak mr stephanopoulo it a little unclear i think we be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the mubarak visit q is he go somewhere for easter mr stephanopoulo not that i know of q what more can you tell u about the additional aid to russium that the president plan to ask congres about mr stephanopoulo he go to be consult with the congres and with my partner over the next couple of week i know that he speak last even with congressman gephardt and their delegation before the the congressional delegation meet with the russian thi week and those consultation will continue over the next several week q do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announce sunday mr stephanopoulo i not go to discus the magnitude q how about the list of cold war restriction where do you stand on that mr stephanopoulo a the president say yesterday he go to be look for that list from the congres thi week and review it he believe he go to try and get it thi week and he go to review the list and we go to take a hard look at it q but they make it up i mean it no white house involvement congres be compile thi list mr stephanopoulo i think he go to talk to the congressional leader about compile the list but i certain we be able to get my own researcher work a well q george be lift the arm embargo more of a probability than a possibility mr stephanopoulo it something that under discussion q secretary christopher ha say that it a matter of time and for month before that happen mr stephanopoulo again all i can say be that it something that the president be review right now we work with my ally in the on a sanction resolution and we continue to review other matter q george can you tell u anything about the schedule thi week any travel mr stephanopoulo they just ask about that i do have anything
