from hallam phill hallam-baker subject re urgent ted frank wanted for killing aj teel in article mnemonic mike godwin write in article hallam write but punish the person for post such a thing smack of authoritarianism it a deliberate act of fraud intend to cause harm you seem to be unclear about the legal mean of fraud mere misrepresentation be not fraud ymy comment here be mean a a put down it fail for several reason you have edit out the context of the action under discussion i never bring the legal definition up i use the english language and not the legal dialect the legal definition of fraud change from one country to another in any case the context of the discussion be morality of censorship how do a post from ymy site do any such thing especially if ymy site be a university do you know any person who believe that a university endorse every comment make from a university site that be why i refer specifically to a company good now do you know any person who believe that a company endorse every comment make from a university site you be extrapolate from the statement i make concern a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the teel case if you have bother to read the post instead of try to prove how stupid you think me you would have do rather better the mode of argument i wa use wa a form of rhetoric argument by example i describe a wide set of circumstance in which an action be permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply thu the action be not permisable obviously a company post from a university adres would be squash it would be contrary to the internet comercial use usenet do not distribute letterhead organization desydeutsch elektronen synchrotron experiment zeu bei hera i suggest strongly that if you mean for thi to be take a letterhead you get a better stationery designer now you be clutch at straw in the context of the discussion it wa the fact of association between the company and the post that wa important the typeface etc be inconsequential there be person on the net who be openly support the murder of member of my family sigh if you be imply that i be lie i suggest you read mark holohan and ulick stafford post into if you be suggest that advocate murder be a trivial matter i would prefer that you state it directly certainly i oppose the right of dr sidiqui and the ayatolah khomenhi to call for the murder of salman rushdie incitement to murder be not part of what i consider legitimate freedom of speech a for ymy notion that employee can argue their different political view at their own expense could you explain precisely what expense you talk about internet be not free the connection charge be quite expensive for comercial concern could you give me a cost breakdown for the expense to ymy company attributable to an employee post a political view in disagreement with your number please that be irrelevant the case be not the incremental cost but the facility cost if i decide that a company i be associate with should subscribe to usenet that usenet connection be the property of the company it be quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of it property in accordance with it policy for example if a microsoft employee be to post window nt be crap do buy it from a microsoft machine i would consider it reasonable for microsoft to sack that employee in the same way if a company decide that it ha political objective it might wish to regulate post in a political manner thi be no worse than rupert murdoch use hi paper a a political platform for hi view i wa refer to the arrogance of ymy position quote the word write by slave owner at me in the cause of freedom which word write by slave owner do i quote i do recall quote anyone ah ye you do not quote them merely refer to them ymy constitution be not consider sacrosanct in other part of the globe nor have i assume it be i do consider the first amendment to have talismanic value you might just a well have attempt to argue from the king jame bible to a muslim i wa point out that ymy reason be parochial when with little effort you could have make a substantive point i make the effort apparently you make a certain effort to misunderstand me ymy article consist of a reference to the first ammendment ymy signature and pretty well damn all else for an example of a uk publication that understand thi try index on censorship i use to subscribe i would still if i wa not move index regularly publish opinion by non-american who believe the first amendment represent appropriate free-speech principle for all open society see the opinion of the dissent law lord in the spycatcher case are you refer to the initial hear on an injunction or the judgment on the substantive case the initial hear that the government win be judge on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harm would be grind for prior restraint the second set of hear on the substance judge that the government have no case and that the official secret act could not be use to suppres information in thwe public domain already the part that they win wa over the copyright issue which be rather separate here again the issue of censorship be rather different in the case that information be divulge on the understand that it will not be communicate to third party the first ammendment certainly do not apply in thi case a the numerou prosecution of spy in the u prove the crux of the spycatcher affair wa extrateritoriality of british law the censorship aspect of it arise a a result of the government ludicrou attempt to prevent summary of the case in the book you have any reason to believe that anything i say ha be reach unquestioningly only most of what you write for someone who purport to be oppose to argument from assertion you certainly get by on assertion a lot funny i saw that a a rejection of an assertion that you have make of course in reject an assertion i have to make a contrary assertion since thi assertion be unprovable i leave it at that so far i have not see you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to ymy own you be attack my anti-censorship view because i dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship argument while reject their conclusion plu i be not an absolutist i have thi funny idea that the solution to thi problem wa not decide in by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line furthermore i do think that the issue be half a simple a you imply you may think that i be be anti-american in disallow recourse to the first ammendment it just that thi argument ha no currency in the part of the world where there be state censorship such a iran kewait and israel i do pretend to have gear my discourse for all conceivable audience i do think that you have geered ymy discourse to any audience save that of prove that you be the only person
