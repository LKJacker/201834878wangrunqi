from hallam phill hallam-baker subject re waco survivor april in article strom rob strom write in article hallam phill hallam-baker write in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it be neccessary to beleive the word of a man who ha just murder child and order the of hi other follower according to the account give the batf attempt to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and be meet by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the supporter claim that the batf start shoot simply do not stand up if the aft have go there to start shoot they would have go with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handgun for all practical purpose they be unarm the b-d follower have automatic weapon the person who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story thi be simply rationalisation it be not enough for them to simply dismis the government a incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themself instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decide to set out to murder person just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through i must object to the characterization of those oppose to the government handle of the waco situation a gun supporter ymy argument try to paint the batf critic a right-wing gun nut and just mix up two issue i be one of the critic and yet i be a liberal and just a anti-gun a you be i just happen to believe that everyone ha civil right even religiou crazy they all human be not some nest of wasp that you try to exterminate the batf create the crisi situation by the way they handle the original raid it wa well know that koresh regularly go jog outside hi property he could have be serve with a search warrant then he could have be arrest if he have refuse to comply instead officer arm with grenade invade the property thi escalate into a shoot war with tragic death on both side those be the first two mistake the bad judgment of ask for a no-knock warrant and the bad and probably illegal way the already-unwise warrant wa serve at thi point the situation escalate to where it wa describe a an arm standoff and a hostage crisi that when the government start cover their trace seal the warrant revise their report history of the incident etc thing be already build up to disaster now the government could have simply close the supply route and wait but accord to janet reno that option have never be seriously consider so supposedly because the agent be frustrate and fatigue and because there supposedly be no backup they felt they have to go in ye the govt handle it in the rambo hollywood type style with extreeme machismo perhap that not the way to handle it it be a completely different thing to start assert a many have do that the government be primarily to blame the comparison with the nazi in particular be purely gratuitou since you have provide a constructive opinion on the issue ymy post desreve to be take seriously peter nelson also make some very good point about how a low key approach might have be more effective the point be though that you learn through mistake the govt play the wrong card and lose that not a big deal they have have fmy guy murder at the begin and maybee they just be not prepare for wuite thi situation who could be if the same thing be to happen all over again we might perhap be able to castigate the govt if they use the same tactic and fail in the same way a it be i ca say that i would not have make the same mistake maybee i would because i do a a rule go in for a confrontational situation if i can avoid it maybee i would because with all those pres about it very difficult not to try the macho stuff the fbi have information from within the compound we have no acces to they may have calculate that the b-d follower resolve wa crack base on their listen device within the compound they know that koresh have chickened out of one suicide attempt thi may have be the reason why they consider that fear might have be a weapon for break hi resolve again in panama they have use the heavy rock music to great effect during bush invasion funny that few of the koresh supporter and appologist complain much about the death of several thousand pananmanian civilian while the u govt attempt to arrest their former ally and please let not turn thi into a pro-gun v anti-gun discussion anti-gun person do not believe that gun-owner deserve to get frontally assault by arm government agent and koresh civil right exist whether hi gun be legal illegal illegal-but-should-have-been-legal or whatever koresh negate hi civil right the minute hi follower fire on the polouse helicopter no matter whether the warrant wa or wa not technically valid the guy who be carry it out think that it wa thu the assault on them wa completely inexcusable no matter what rationalisation person might wish to employ of course we have to consider the gun issue that be the whole core of the question everything else be a diversion phill hallam-baker
