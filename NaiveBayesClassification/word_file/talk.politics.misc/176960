from clinton-hq subject clinton background briefing in vancouver the white house office of the pres secretary vancouver british columbium background briefing by senior administration official april canada place vancouver british columbium pst folk we about to start the background briefing on the aid package senior administration official good morning the president president clinton and president yeltsin agree yesterday on a series of american initiative to support economic and political reform in russium and it value at billion before take ymy question and run through the basic outline of thi package i want to make a few point first thi be the maximum that the clinton administration can do with available fund to support russian reform all of the fund have be allocate and appropriate by the congres there be no need for the administration to go back to the congres to fund any of these program all my fiscal year fund currently be available so in effect all of these program can begin tomorrow the second point be that thi package be design to support russian reformer all of the initiative in the package be direct at reformer and for their benefit and all have be work out with prior consultation with the russian government third the president be determine that we will deliver on these commitment thi year the package be design to maximize my ability to support reform in design it we want to avoid make commitment that we could not meet and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitment in front of you fourth i like to note the special importance of trade and investment i think it fair to say that russium capital and technology need throughout the next decade extend well into the hundred of billion of dollar no collection of government can meet those need only the private sector can do so and so the president and president yeltsin agree to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship they also agree that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space form head on the side by vice president gore on the russian side by prime minister chernomyrdin and the goal of thi effort be to break through the barrier to trade and investment on both side and to promote a vastly expand relationship if it would be helpful i be prepare to run down the first page which be a summary of assistance and just give you some general background on what these program be i do it quickly and then i be glad to take question the first group of initiative be humanitarian food and medical assistance thi be part of my effort which ha be underway for several year to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the russian government can assure there at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelve in the major city that million in grant that be from food for progress the grant portion of food for progress we also be continue my grant assistance in medicine and pharmaceutical supply and that million the second item be concessional food sale a you know the united state ha have a long-term grain relationship with russium it important to u and it important to russium that we continue that relationship the president ha choose the food for progress program which be a concessional loan program the value over the next seven month be million these be concessional term the exact term have not be work out but i think it fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven year and concessional rate thereafter for the life of the deal the third program be a collection of private sector support we think thi be one of the most important thing we go to do privatization and the creation of small business be the number one priority of the reform government in moscow and so the president ha decide to create a russian-american enterprise fund capitalize thi year at million and the goal of thi fund be to make direct loan to small business in russium to take equity position in those business the president ha also decide to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the russian government in it priority objective of try to convert state enterprise from a state-owned basi to a private basi he ha also agree the president ha also agree to establish a eurasium foundation thi would be a private foundation lead by prominent american to fund democratization project in russium the fourth group you see there in the summary page be democratization itself i think it fair to say that thi administration ha give a new impetu to the goal of pursue democratization in russium you see that we have a total of million in program variou program the detail table give an indication of some of the program that we launch the president be also call for the development of a democracy corp which will be an overarch umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public effort now underway from the united state to support reform in russium the fifth program you see be russian office of resettlement thi be a new initiative create and conceptualize by thi administration thi be a demonstration project what we like to do be work with the russian military to help resettle russian officer return from the baltic state and other part of the former soviet union we want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that whether it with russian labor and russian material or use prefab american construction and so we decide to fund on a demonstration basi the construction of house unit we be work very closely with the russian military on thi and i would say that we have a long-term commitment to thi project the sixth area be energy in the environment they be two issue that the president feel strongly about my initial effort will be feasibility study to look into the possibility of enhance their energy production both oil and ga and equally important try to cut down on the leakage in the oil and ga pipeline system which cause so much environmental damage i talk a little bite about trade and investment about the new group be create that the vice president will chair on my side secretary ron brown will also be cochairing with deputy prime minister shohkin a busines development committee which will work in all other sector of the economy to break down the many barrier that currently exist and impede trade and investment we be also go to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the american government to work on thi problem full-time and the point i like to make here be trade and investment in the be every bite a important to draw an analogy a arm reduction wa in the and and we just think that in look at thi we need to make a commitment within my own government to have person work on it senior person on a full-time basi because it be terribly important you notice that the united state be go to support russium membership in the gatt russium ha have observer statu russium ha request my support and in fact request my advice in become a member of the gatt we think that the long-term goal of draw russium into the global economy be paramount a very important goal and that be why we be support the membership in the gatt we be also support their acces to gsp the generalized system of preference you note that ex-im ha extend million in credit for a caterpillar deal in siberium that opic ha extend million in credit and loan guarantee for a conoco oil project i like to emphasize that we be very close to an agreement between russium and the united state for a framework facility through the ex-im bank that would finance russian purchase of american oil and ga equipment and service we think thi be a very important development we think we get there by april which be the open day of the tokyo conference the conference before i take any further question i like to defer to my colleague who will review the security assistance objective with you senior administration official my major unfinished agenda with the russian and with their counterpart in ukraine kazakhstan and belaru be in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenal on their territory under the term of the start i and start ius agreement recently we complete in moscow three i think very important agreement that devote a significant chunk of nunn-lugar fund to three important program the first be the program of million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program that be for submarine for icbm dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement million the second be a million tranche of fund for the construction of a facility to store nuclear material remove from the warhead a they be dismantle thi will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phase of the construction of that storage facility and finally a tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitor system for the nuclear material a they be withdraw from the weapon system so we add that total to the extant nunn-lugar assistance which ha be flow about million for some overall safety improvement for variou kind of equipment and safety measure that we have be work out with the russian over the last couple of year so thi be an area where we will be go a lot more work with not only the russian but with the ukrainian kazhak and belarussian belaru for example ha just in the last couple of week receive up to million in fund for safety security and dismantlement program on belarussian territory and thi wa in the wake of their ratification of start i an agreement to accede to npt so we be work very hard with all the party to the lisbon protocol and will continue to work very hard with them and i look upon these three recent agreement with russium a a very important step in that proces q the opic fund to be that for the field in kazhakstan and conoco already sign thi deal with kazhakstan why do you feel now it be necessary if it the same one why do you feel it necessary senior administration official it not the same deal chevron sign a deal with kazhakstan the tenge oil field thi be a new investment project it a polar light oil development and renovation project and it be announce today so it completely new q can you tell u more about what involve senior administration official ye conoco like other american oil company ha be search for way to do two thing one to prospect for new oil in siberium west siberium and two to try to get into the busines of renovate oil well and renovate pipeline both oil and ga in russium the objective here obviously be to take advantage of the natural resource in russium increase energy production which will in turn increase hard currency revenue which be what russium need so we think thi deal be very very good development for russium the russian do a well and it good for an american company and the american government ha play a lead role in pull thi together through the credit facility in opic and through the loan guarantee q so it to search and also to renovate field that be already there senior administration official that right q on that point should other american company expect to get administration support for such deal or should they now go to the ex-im and try to get the money out of the billion senior administration official well a you know ex-im be part of the government and variou part of the government have be push include the state department and the white house for thi deal to be consummate and we think it will and if we arrive at thi agreement by april there will be billion in finance available for american company to sell their equipment and sell their service q that should take up all of the rest of the deal and their wo be and their will or there wo be support for opic sort of deal such a thi conoco senior administration official there a tremendou amount of interest on the part of american oil and ga company to invest in russium we think that the ex-im oil and ga facility the facility once it be conclude will soak up a lot of that interest but i think the interest may even extend beyond that and if so the government will respond q what the current year budget cost of that agreement should it go forward and be there any current year budget cost senior administration official i have to refer you to ex-im for that i do know the detail of that q the concessional food sale be there any current year cost to that or be it delay until the year in which the payment be due senior administration official the concessional food sale be from food for progress which be a usda program usda ha the fund we do need to go back to the congres to expend those fund there will be a hit in the budget i refer you to usda and omb for the detail on that q can you talk about the democracy corps q and the private sector how many folk be go to be involve in that senior administration official why do i start with the democracy corps first i think the administration felt come into office that there be literally thousand of organization private organization in the united state that in one way or another be work at the goal of try to achieve democratization in russium help on a farmer-to-farmer basi and there be literally or government agency that have a variety of program in thi area and so the administration felt the president felt it wa important to try to draw all of these initiative together under one group to give some coherence to the effort and to give some impetu to the effort and so thi be a presidential initiative it will be head by ambassador tom simon who will soon take up hi duty a the coordinator for assistance in the former soviet union and we very hopeful that we might use thi democracy corps not only to draw upon the resource of my own government but the resource of the american private sector and school and community acros the nation q any kind of commitment yet any kind of word yet on and any new money that need to be appropriate beside the million the president talk about senior administration official the administration be request additional fund in of million what the president ha do thi weekend be to consult really intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional measure the united state could take in some of these area to support reform he be consult with the congres when he return to washington he be consult also with the other ally government and we make a decision at that time q two question about the billion agricultural money first of all i think it wa the sort of consensu that what russium do not need wa more loan for food so why do you decide to do it that way secondly could you explain agriculture ha be stop from make further loan for food because of russium inability to pay how do thi fit into that situation senior administration official a you know the united state for a long time ha be a major supplier of grain and food commodity agricultural product to russium i think between and we have extend a little bite of history here about billion in credit credit guarantee through the commodity credit corporation that wa the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of american grain product on december of last year the russian government stop it payment on that program they be now in arrear to u on that program and therefore by law the united state can not continue that program and so the president work with secretary espy and other official in the cabinet look for other way that we could promote american grain sale and i think we have two way to do that we announce today million in grant food assistance through the food for progress program but we do not have sufficient authority to spend million in grant food and so we look for a concessional loan program i think everybody agree that russium that a short-term loan program for russium would not make sense now but a long-term concessional loan program would and that be what thi program be it will provide once the final detail be work out for a six to seven-year grace period on payment of principal and then from year seven through which be the life of the deal it will provide for concessional rate of interest generally around three to fmy percent and so we believe and the russian government believe thi be a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payment and put them into the out year but it will also continue thi very important grain relationship which be important for them and it important for the american farm community q i gather from what you say that thi could make it explicit the russian failure to pay the interest on ecc loan do not in any way affect thi kind of loan go through be that right senior administration official let me be explicit about that we be prevent under the law to from continue the commodity credit corporation short-term credit program because of russium arrearage to the united state all of you know about those arrearage they total about i think around million usda can give you an exact figure so have take that into consideration and want to preserve american market share and a long-term grain relationship want to respond to a specific request from the russian government for major food assistance know that we could take it from the grant program because we do have sufficient authority there we look at food for progress which be a program we use to great effect in other part of the world and we consult with the russian government and arrive at thi solution i think the russian be please because it provide them with the food but also gife them a little bite of relief on the short-term payment q where do those fund actually come from senior administration official they come from the food for progress program which be a program under usda authority usda ha the authority to spend these fund we do not need to go back to the congres for these fund and i want to make that general point again everything in thi package the billion package comprise fund that have already be allocate and appropriate by the congres the administration can begin to spend these money tomorrow and it very important in my eye that we expend all the fund thi year that we meet these commitment and we be confident we be able to do so q how do you arrive at the figure of million do that max out that program or do you actually have a range from to senior administration official there a reason for it the reason wa that the russian government tell u that about the amount of grain that they need between now and harvest time and so the idea be that we would begin the shipment probably million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn at which time russium wo require the same level of food import from the west q i would imagine there go to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republic because of the size and the scope of thi with russium have you give any consideration to advance negotiation for the same kind of project with the ukraine with georgia with some of the other republic senior administration official ye we very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extend american support to the other country of the former soviet union we have tell ourself and we have plan that in the area of technical assistance the grant technical assistance that you see roughly percent of the fund will go to russium and roughly percent to the other country in the area of food sale we have be active with ukraine in grant food assistance with georgia and armenium we will continue that and i think it fair to say that after thi summit we will go back and look at all of my program with the other country to ensure that they be adequate and they be productive and they hard-hitting q ha anything happen at the summit to lead american energy company and other company to believe that russium be go to be more user-friendly toward them in term of tax legality bureaucracy senior administration official well one of my primary objective come into thi summit wa to highlight not only the economic agenda but also trade and investment and i like to refer to the point i make at the begin we convince in talk about thi problem the problem of how to support russium long-term we convince that no collection of western government have the financial resource over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform that only the private sector can do that we look at my own society and we see tremendou capability in resource in the oil and ga sector it be a very good match with what the russian need now which be financial investment in the exist oil and ga well and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production that what the russian government ha tell u it want to do and so that why we have make such a major emphasi on it that why trade and investment wa a prominent issue on the first day of these talk and in fact figure prominently last night in the meet between president yeltsin and president clinton and we hop that together we might send a strong signal to the american busines community that we support their effort to invest in russium that the united state through ex im and opec and the department of commerce will be there to support them q my question be be yeltsin in any position to deliver on make russium a more senior administration official we think he be i would note that president yeltsin prime minister mr chernomyrdin work for year in the russian oil and ga sector he will now chair a high-level commission with the vice president vice president gore to try to break through the barrier that currently exist to western investment in the oil and ga sector we believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee and we look forward to the work q what type of mechanism be already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program and will the be directly involve in the tail end of distribution of the actual fund or be the money simply turn over to the russian government for distribution at their will senior administration official are you talk about the variety of program list here it depend on the program itself in most case though we be either work through american pbo or american government agency to ensure that the money obviously be well spend that the money get to the intend source that an obligation we have to the congres to ensure the money be well spend and that we can account for the money we have do that in the last couple of month intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these program but they be all quite different for instance in the area of grant food and medical assistance for grant food it be carry out through usda and usda account for the delivery of the food for grant medical assistance we be work through project hope which be a private organization for the house for instance the resettlement of russian officer we be work with a group of american pbo on some of the democratization project we work directly with russian private individual and private foundation we work with journalist in russium on a medium project that you may have notice so we literally have here to different activity under all these rubric and they all go to be carry out in slightly different way some directly with the russian government some with russian citizen q the jackson-vanik restriction that remain and on the cocom restriction that remain can you tell u what the president ha to do on that senior administration official well a george note yesterday president yeltsin raise these a irritant in the relationship the president ha note that i think it fair to say we will go back now in my own government when we return to washington and look at both of these question and we get back to the russian government q you be not prepare for these question when you get here senior administration official we be prepare for these question we look at them but we not prepare to make a quick decision thi weekend they require let me just explain particularly on jackson-vanik they require consultation with the congres they require consultation with the american jewish community and we very sensitive to those concern and so we want to go back and talk to them before we take any action q is thi package design so that you will not have to go to congres for anything at thi point senior administration official a i say at the begin the advantage of thi particular package be that all the fund have be allocate and appropriate by the congres so the administration will not have to go back to the congres to seek any additional authority to fund any of these effort in effect they can all begin tomorrow and i know that many of the agency responsible for these project will begin tomorrow and that the advantage of thi particular initiative q if thi a the president say be a long-term long-haul thing and member of congres be at thi moment head for moscow why be you talk about go to congres and suggest to the president of russium that you be prepare to go to congres for variou thing senior administration official i think we be clear about that the president be discuss thi weekend with president yeltsin some additional idea that we have for american fund of additional project and idea that he ha we have a major congressional delegation that leave last night head by representative gephardt and we want to consult with that delegation and other member of congres before do anything and we also want to consult with my ally so that where it stand now q we be tell repeatedly that a number of these item represent different or new way of spend the money already appropriate could you just tick off which of these item represent reprogramming or at least spend money in way that it wa not previously set to be senior administration official i think that we say that these be all project that either congres have allocate money for through the freedom support act there be some fund that be leave over from and thi administration take office and have some new idea about how the fund might be expend we do use just the freedom support act fund or the fund we go into some of the agency allocation ex-im opic and usda and try to look for creative way to further my program and example of that be the food for progress concessional loan we have hit a brick wall with another type of fund through usda we could not go forward legally and so we look for a more creative way to ensure continue american market share and ensure continue grain sale and we think we find it q where for example be you get the money for thi russian officer resettlement senior administration official that from the freedom support act fund q in other word all of the money be be directly spend in new way so to speak senior administration official most of the grant project that you see if you look at the general chart the second chart it break down into grant and credit and if you look under grant the technical cooperation project that total million that be almost all freedom support act fund a little bite of it be leftover fund from fiscal year the nunn-lugar fund of course you know about the legislative history of those fund q cooperation senior administration official from fy i do have the exact figure it wa not a considerable figure q could you tell u please ha anything happen here thi weekend that will break the log jam between ukraine and russium over start for start i and ius a a result of what happen here senior administration official both president president yeltsin and president clinton will be discuss thi issue thi morning in fact we have yet get to security and arm control relate issue that will be thi morning session i know that president clinton will be very strongly reinforce that thi be a top priority for u we be talk to the russian and the ukrainian over the last couple of week about way that we might help to facilitate the discussion between them up to thi point thi ha be a very important negotiation that be go on essentially between moscow and kiev and we be at the point now of essentially discuss with them if there be way that we could contribute to thi discussion help to move thing forward essentially but in term of what be come out of thi weekend i do yet know in a couple hour we know q just a follow-up on the finance here is any of thi rob peter to pay bori since it all current year appropriation have you take it from anyplace that be earmark and put it into thi fund senior administration official there be smoke and mirror here and i think it an important point to note we could have give you a page of assistance number that include out-year fund we go to make a long-term commitment to many of these project for instance the enterprise fund the privatization effort the house effort and we already talk to the russian about my long-term commitment we could have put in really big number and thi could have be a bigger package but we want to make a point thi package be fy it fund that we have and we go to do what we say we go to do and the president feel very strongly about that in the past there be a legacy that the western government the combination of government put up large budget figure and for any number of reason we not able to meet them we determine and the president be determine to carry out every single program in thi package and we do it but we do have a longer-term commitment and that part of the discussion on economic thi weekend we look for russian idea on what it be we can do to most effectively support reform and we tell them that we do have a commitment on some of these program beyond thi fiscal year q take it way from any senior administration official no we have okay the question be have we reprogrammed any of these fund so have we take it from other country to pay for program in russium the answer be no we have not do so q in term of fund there be no available money leave and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else do that in fact support the theory senior administration official not at all i do think it do that a particular example and the example be grain sale the commodity credit corporation credit guarantee program wa short-term loan that russium have to pay back within to month you all know about russium debt problem and russium wa unable to meet those commitment so we look for a way to do two thing to meet russium requirement for grain they a net grain importer on a massive scale and also meet my objective of make sure that the american farmer have a chance to sell their product to russium and we simply look for another way to finance that and we have legislative authority to do it thi program ha be successful in other area we have not try it before in the former soviet union but we think we should now q is thi really the bush-clinton aid package for russium since these fund be really first derive by initiative put forward by president bush senior administration official no i do think that a fair characterization a lot of these fund be appropriate by the congres be in thi administration take office and inherit some obligation that the bush administration have make but we have a long six to seven week review of thi program we decide to meet the commitment that have be make by the previou administration but we have go well beyond them in fund the enterprise fund which wa just an idea but the idea have not be fill out with a program there wa no number attach to it in group together some project and try to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort i would say be another clinton initiative further we listen to the russian government and listen to the russian military who tell u that the resettlement of their officer wa important to them for political and economic and social reason and president clinton ha respond to that and we be make a long-term commitment that beyond thi demonstration project we go to figure out a way to do much more in try to settle those officer i would also say that the president ha give impetu to all of u in the agency to think much more broadly about what it be we can do on democratization because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lend itself to the russian experience and in call for the creation of a democracy corp which be another new initiative we hopeful that we can take the resource of the private sector a well a the american government to achieve that objective so i would not characterize it that way at all and a most of you know i be a career civil servant i wa in the last administration i very familiar with what the last administration do and i would characterize thi a a clinton assistance package for russium q there be a lot of criticism that aid in the past ha not get to the person is there anything in thi outside of the ombudsman that will guarantee that thi money will not just disappear because it be administer by the russian government senior administration official i think that i know that the president and other senior official of my government be concern that american money be spend wisely and that it get to the source that it intend for which it intend and so we go to take great care aid and the state department will take great care in make sure that the fund be expend properly and that they reach their source i would not that thi package be not simply a package of support solely to the russian government some of these project especially in democratization and exchange be go to be work out directly with russian private individual with business the private enterprise support be another example of that senior administration official if i could just add a word on thi point with regard to the ssd-related program one area that we be look at very very closely be consideration of actually use russian firm in subcontract for these kind of program they would be work very closely of course with the american firm who would be the prime contractor but thi be a fine example i think of a more of a imaginative and flexible approach toward get some of that fund down to the grassroot level down to the grind in russium but at the same time ensure that it be spend efficiently and for the purpose for which it wa intend q when would the democracy corp start exactly when do you see thi happen how would get it off the grind senior administration official well the president be today call for the creation of a democracy corp i think it fair to say that we go to work out it framework over the next couple of week ambassador simon take up hi duty on may but in effect we already start because over the last couple of week the administration ha begin to reach out to person in the private sector who have come to u ask u to help facilitate their activity in russium and we say that we will be helpful we also try to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activity of my own government we do have or agency that be active in russium in one way or another we think it make sense to draw them together and to focu their effort q excuse me how much of thi billion will actually be spend in the united state by american make good senior administration official i do have any figure for you now but perhap we could try to work something up in the next couple of day on that q thi figure be larger than the figure that ha be in the pres do thi program grow yesterday a a result of the discussion or have we just be that far off the mark senior administration official no i think unfortunately the pres ha be a little bite off the mark and i sorry to say that no thi package president clinton put u to work about seven week ago on thi package and he wa brief intensively on thi he contribute a lot of the intellectual leadership in thi package he contribute a lot of the idea in the package and i think it fair to say that we have thi rough package work out about two week ago we have be refine it ever since we spend a couple of day last week go over it with the russian government both the embassy in washington and the government in moscow through my own embassy and so it be evolve but thi particular package ha be together for about two week q where be yeltsin input into thi then there wa so much talk before about the president want to get yeltsin view about specifically what wa need and so forth is that in the out year senior administration official no it both president yeltsin ha on several occasion tell u for instance that support for the creation of private business be important to him that the resettlement of russian military officer be important and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industry be important to them and so what we do wa to try to make those the centerpiece of my technical assistance part o the package we listen to him on the privatization effort we have be work with the russian government for month on thi try to work out all the detail so the russian government on most of these program wa involve every step of the way but let me get at the other part of ymy question the president be also use thi weekend to talk about a broader set of initiative that we might undertake and we look for hi idea the president ha bring hi own idea to the table for instance on energy and the environment and in house but we look for russian idea not we need to consult with the congres and we need to consult with the other ally government that be also active q there essentially nothing that happen in the last day and a half that measurably alter the package that you come in with senior administration official thi particular package a i say wa work out and wa ready about two week ago we have since then consult with the russian government on the final stage of it development and so thi weekend we primarily talk about future about what more the united state and other western country can do to support reform in russium which be my base objective here q i notice that you that money appropriate to train banker and businessman and officer can you tell me what about job train for worker who be displace by privatization senior administration official you right we have a program to train russian young russian in bank and financial service in the united state part of the house initiative it not just to build house unit it to retrain russian officer who be retire into other profession q money for job train for worker whose job be disappear because of privatization senior administration official we have not yet allocate any money for that q why not q of the million be go to build house unit is that a lot of money per unit give what the western dollar will buy in the former soviet union senior administration official if you want to do house the right way it not just the build the framework of a house you get to think about all the utility you get to think about the purchase of land you get to think about sewage and ga and electricity and so forth and it also retrain it not enough to put retire an officer come out of riga or tallin or vilniu in a house in western russium we think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officer a well thi be respond to a request from the russian government q of the million will go to retrain senior administration official that right q are you talk about apartment build or single senior administration official we talk about single individual dwell q you say that only family will be serve by thi senior administration official what i want to i think i point out earlier thi be a demonstration project what we do want to do give the experience that the german and the turk and the italian have have in build house in western russian we do not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money what we want to do be work over the next couple of month and try to figure out with american organization in the private sector the best way to get thi job do i note that we have a long-term commitment to that and so i would expect that we would put a lot more money into thi in the future but we want to do it wisely we want to spend the money wisely q what be it about thi program that convince you that it will protect russium reform and that russium will be in a position to may back the money they suppose to pay back especially consider their other debt problem senior administration official well look i think it important to note that the united state on it own do not have the capability to fuel a continuation of russian reform it get to be a collective western effort and we look to my ally to do more a well but beyond that it really what the russian do that be go to decide the fate of reform we can simply play a role and we feel we have an obligation to do so which be consistent with my national interest q did the president say that the value of the contribution wa that it would create security and prosperity for the united state so what be it about thi program that do thi senior administration official i think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of my policy toward russium and that be we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform we be convince that if reformer stay in power then we be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear force foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction which be the three benefit to the united state from reform in russium so it not a simple question you ca just say that thi program be the answer it a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it q and then on the question of russium ability to repay what convince you they be able to pay seven to year from now senior administration official well the russian government ha make a commitment to repay and what we hop be that if reform continue and if they can continue to improve their oil and ga sector and earn additional hard currency revenue that russium will be in a position six or seven year from now to pay back those loan q substantial government-to-government loan we ever get into with the russian senior administration official i do want to answer authoritatively on that i do go back or year on thi but in the last fmy or five year ye it be because the previou way that we finance grain export wa really to just ensure private bank loan thi be a different type of effort q government loan in any other sector that you recall i know it wa do in senior administration official i think it fair to say thi be a new and unique effort pdt
