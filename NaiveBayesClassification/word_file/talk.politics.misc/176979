from wdstarr william december starr subject re debating special hate crime law in article say thi sort of separate treatment by the law ha no place in an equal society the solution to the fact that some class be more vulnerable to attack or discrimination be to do what ha alway be do in response to imbalance in criminal activity and citizen protection to allocate law enforcement resource to more efficiently and effectively deal with the problem not to rewrite the law itself wdstarr so how do you feel about increase penalty for kill a policeman a federal employee or to use both scalium and steven example increase penalty for threaten the president i assume that like all good person you oppose the marital exemption for rape so i wo bring that up in order of ymy question i oppose it i oppose it i oppose it and huh wha where do that topic come from and what it get to do with the discussion at hand when i wa discuss the concept of different criminal law for crime against different class of person and ye i do consider law which enhance penalty follow conviction base upon the convict attitude toward the clas membership of the victim to fit into that category the category of class i have in mind wa that of the standard civil right discussion class base upon race gender ethnicity religion sexual orientation etc having you ask about class base upon one profession rather than one personal characteristic catch me off guard and i have to think out the question from scratch what i finally decide wa that the law should not recognize such class because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some person to be of more worth than other and that would be anathema to the underlie american concept of equal treatment under the law last year when a federal crime bill wa under consideration which would have expand the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plu crime include the murder of variou federal officer hitherto not protect by that aura of deterrence critic point out the absurdity of have law which make the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher when the latter arguably provide a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater los to society thi wa an emotionally compel argument but even the proponent of that viewpoint appear to tacitly assume that the state should judge some life a be more valuable than other on the basi of their contribution to society i view that doctrine a be both a personally repugnant and b repugnant to the equal protection clause of the amendment accordingly i believe that there should be no law which give any profession-based clas of person special protection vium the mechanism of supply stronger statutory deterrence of crime against member of that clas not even polouse officer federal officer or high-ranking member of the executive branch of the federal government william december starr wdstarr
