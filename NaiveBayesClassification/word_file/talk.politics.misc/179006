from mitchell s todd subject re waco burn russotto matthew t russotto write mitchell s todd write russotto matthew t russotto write we hear it it sure ring true it consistent in a way that ma suicide by fire be not thi survivor be also say that they be trap inside by the damage do by the tank why be an accidental fire more plausible than a ma suicide consider that the davidian be an apocalyptic cult with a history of arm violence if the fbi ha reason to lie about the cause of the fire if it result from their own negligence then the bd survivor also have reason to lie if they start the blaze the fbi claim the fire wa set simultaneously in three place they claim the build wa fill with tear ga electricity wa cut off tank be roll all around how do the bd coordinate the set of the fire it fairly simple it wa decide to burn the place down and more than one agent wa dispatch to set the fire in separate part of the compound i doubt that simultaneously mean at the exact same time in thi case it likely mean close enough together to preclude them from be part of the same fire the fbi claim that man with torch set the fire but have release any evidence of thi though it seem inconcievable that they do have any if it wa true they might be wait until the evidence come in from the site and the investigation be at least well underway all of the bd previou action be aim toward their survival not their death the same could be say of jonestown the idea that kerosene lamp would be all over the place with electricity cut off make sense the idea that ram tank into the build would spill them and cause a fire make sense the possibility that the fbi would know thi be nil it wa simple negligence maybe then again i be suprised at what folk have miss in the past in similar situation do jump t oconclusion mitchell s todd zeu
