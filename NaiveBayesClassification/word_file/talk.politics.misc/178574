from kennej kennedy jame scot subject we win the war on drug not the dea and other organization would have the american person believe that we be win the war on drug i go to dispel the propaganda that the dea be put out by show you the drug war real statu to help prove my assertion i also post two article from usa today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age group be on the rise if wod be work a we lead to believe then drug abuse should have go down substantially by now the reality be be that it ha not go down very much if anything substance abuse be on the rise i also go to supply a possible solution to thi problem the follow text be an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitle hello again mary jane which appear in the current issue of time magazine april p law-enforcement official say pot advocate be just blow smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed perhap because of the change of administration the marijuana lobby be out in full force say robert bonner head of the drug enforcement administration the fact be they lose the battle in more than of youth age to say they smoke marijuana in that figure wa and bonner say it be still fall bonner also offer a reminder that study confirm such marijuana health risk a destruction of nerve cell in the brain and lung damage the chart that follow wa take from the wednesday april issue of usa today drug use up among eigth-grader by mike snider p adolescent choice drug use by eighth grader in the last month estimated per student pct chg alcohol cigarette marijuana amphetamine lsd cocaine crack source university of michigan institute for social research report we be not win the war on drug i think you can see that one of the tactic that the dea employ to give person the impression that the war on drug be be win be to selectively quote statistic only statistic that support their contention that drug use ha go down the excerpt from time magazine that i include in thi post be an excellent example of how organization like the dea attempt to deceive the public usage of one particular drug may have go down but at the same time usage of other drug may have go up substitution also drug usage among one particular age group may have go down but drug usage among another age group may have go up therefore if one take a look at the big picture take into consideration all the statistic then it obviou that the so-called war on drug be be lose perhap the drug war be be win a far a illegal drug go but if one factor in alcohol abuse smoke and use of inhalant then the magnitude of the drug problem in thi country can then place in it true perspective for those of you who do consider alcohol to be a drug then try drink a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it not a drug agency like the dea only go after illegal drug thi be one of the reason why the drug war be a fruitles attempt at prevent substance abuse person will merely switch to another drug if the one they be use become scarce or unpopular the solution to the drug abuse problem in thi country may be to legalize some not all drug whose toxicity ha be show to be within reasonable limit you wo drop dead after use it a few time and then couple thi with a massive drug education program the reason why i think legalization be part of the solution be because person seem to be able to easily obtain drug despite the government effort to the contrary the money spend on drug interdiction could be spend more effectively elsewhere drug education additionally legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be take out of drug traffic which often go along with other kind of crime not to mention the fact that addict would have le reason to prey on innocent person for their money and posession in order to support their expensive habit legalization would cause the street price of drug to fall substantially so drug would be much more affordable to addict imho the way to reduce substance abuse be to do to drug what ha be do to smoker make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish person by incarcerate them a you already know person in the smoke a lot le than they use to thi reduction in the number of smoker ha be bring about by public awarenes campaign law restrict where person can light up warn label on cigarette package taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption and so on i propose that similar method be use to reduce substance abuse after legalization ha be carry out they be a follow drug be sell must come with clear concise information which state the possible health hazzard involve with use thi product and recommendation on how the drug should be use thing like dosage level and how long the drug should be use ought to accompany the package the drug be contain in all drug should be tax at a rate that generate a lot of revenue but not so high a to encourage person to acquire drug through illegal channel part of the revenue collect from drug taxe should be use to fund drug education and law enforcement make it a felony to sell drug to minor person under the age of anyone can sell drug but they must not dodge pay the taxe on drug or sell drug with the warn information absent failure to pay the appropiate taxe on drug or omit warn information should also be a felony establish a government agency whose job be to insure that the purity and safety of all drug be a high a possible thi agency would try to prevent person from get a hold of bad drug something that be a fairly seriou problem now i sure that many of the thing i discuss in thi article have be hash out before in thi newsgroup nevertheles i think it wa a good idea to give my two cent actually a buck and a half all at once so you could get a good idea of where i currently stand on wod go ahead and tear into my post i sure there be something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame btw i post the article from usa today to not only help prove my assertion but also to provide information on lsd usage among youth something which i notice some poster to thi group be interest in scott kennedy brewer and patriot before david koresh be a cheap thug who interpret the bible through the barrel of a gun atf spokesman after the atf be a cheap thug who interpret the constitution through the barrel of a gun me
