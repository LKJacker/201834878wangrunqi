from mcgoy david mcgaughey subject re high speed rail be bad bmich brian keith michalk write a few week ago i find out about some of the politic that be go on with the texa bullet train and wa appal at some of the apparent underhanded tactic to push thi thing through without any public say whatsoever so i write up a short editorial thing and post it hop to get some discussion i suppose editorial do do it here so now i be ask for the general opinion of the net about the propose high speed train what do you think i personally think it be a stupid idea and that there be a few person somewhere who be go to get very rich from thi deal my opinion be thi in a society whose economy be primarily base on capitalism the role of government should be to provide those good and service that need provide for the general public good but government should supply those necessary good and service only when it be impossible for a private enterprise or individual to make money from provide them i agree with some of the other post that thi train probably can not make money and will rely heavily on state tax dollar the question i think then become do we the general public need the train i certainly do not nor will i ever need thi train in lubbock texa with the inexpensive air travel provide between dalla and houston i do think person in dalla or houston need it either david mcgaughey texa tech university
