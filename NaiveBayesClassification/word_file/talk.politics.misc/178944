from rcollin roger collin subject re limiting govt wa re employment wa re why not concentrate steveh steve hendrick write let me try to drag thi discussion back to the original issue a i note before i not necessarily dispute the benefit of eliminate anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealer barber etc one need not however swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish thi end just because one grant the benefit of allow anyone who wish to cut hair to sell service without regulation do not mean that the same unregulated barber should be free to bleed person a a medical service without government intervention a libertarian would argue on a case by case basi the ratio of government regulation be obviously worthwhile the libertarian agenda however do not call for thi assessment it assume that the cost of regulation of any kind alway outweigh it benefit thi approach avoid all sort of difficult analysi but it strike many of the rest of u a dogmatic to say the least i have no objection to an analysi of medical care education national defense or local polouse that suggest a free market can provide a more effective efficient mean of accomplish social objective than be provide through statist approach with some notable exception however i do not see such nitty-gritty worthwhile analysi be carry out by self-professed libertarian excellently put even a a libertarian i have to admit government do do some thing i like there be a beautiful perform art complex in ft lauderdale that wa partially build with tax dollar i do know how much wa private and how much wa steal i mean public but it be beautiful and i enjoy it keep in mind though most of the person in the city will never attend a single performance there so they might feel differently about have to help pay for it however i have to disagree about it be desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basi in fact we have a lot better luck maintain my freedom of speech precisely because it be not decide on a case-by-case basi a much a other issue judge decide whether political speech be allow on the sidewalk in front of the post office they do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi pro-choice pro-life or pro-tax political speech should be allow on the sidewalk in front of the post office you can imagine the result if right to free speech wa decide by the majority on a case-by-case basi not so with economic issue government do tell taxi-driver exactly what they can charge but not the bu line or the lawyer just a it be not desireable to decide right of free speech on a case-by-case basi we should not decide right to free enterprise on a case-by-case basi there be hope that a government can be restrict from interferring with free enterprise but there be no hope in my opinion of have a government that interfere with free enterprise in an efficient manner i call it political market failure thu if you value freedom and the abundance it produce you have to swallow the whole libertarian agenda roger collin
