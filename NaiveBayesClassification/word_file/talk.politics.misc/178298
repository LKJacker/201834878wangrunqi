from wdstarr william december starr subject re law and economic procedural note ted direct followup to only while i respect hi right to do so my own opinion be that followup-to field be mere suggestion not mandatory command and thi issue be of sufficient a general political relevance and b civil liberty interest to warrant keep it active in and a well at least for thi round in article say uh no that not what happen in boomer what happen in boomer wa that the judge do allow the plaintiff to blackmail the cement plant by demand a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over in damage and require the plant to pay the plaintiff the to make them whole the plant would never have be shut down the plaintiff lawyer would have just negotiate a windfall settlement because the plaintiff would prefer an amount greater than to have the plant shut down while the plant would prefer any amount le than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation everyone property right be protect the plaintiff be make whole unnecessary settlement cost be avoid okay now here my interpretation of boomer base on the fact a present in the new york court of appeal hold boomer v note the new york court of appeal be the highest court in new york state while the united state and of the fifty state call their highest court supreme court supreme judicial court or supreme court of appeal maryland and new york call their simply the court of appeal to make matter worse new york also call it second-highest court the supreme court appellate division atlantic cement co oscar h boomer et al own land near the atlantic cement company plant near albany the fact pattern gife no information a to which come first the plaintiff acquisition of the land or he defendant start of production at their cement plant in the course of it regular operation the cement plant do injury to the plaintiff property vium dirt smoke and vibration emanate from the plant the plaintiff seek injunctive relief that be they ask the court to order atlantic cement to stop damage their property commentary thi seem entirely reasonable to me boomer at al own their property and presumably a right to quiet enjoyment of it atlantic cement action be deprive boomer et al of that right instead of grant the plaintiff request for an injunction the court order them to accept the damage be do to their property provide that atlantic cement pay them in compensatory damage in other word the court grant atlantic cement co a private party the power and authority to take the plaintiff right to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain a take by eminent domain be alway problematical even when it do by the state allow a private firm to do it be in my opinion totally wrong ye i know the boomer court do call it eminent domain but if it walk like eminent domain and swim like eminent domain and quack like eminent domain let me take issue with the way you present the case you say that what happen in boomer wa that the judge do allow the plaintiff to blackmail the cement plant by demand a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over in damage blackmail pull out black law dictionary abridged edition blackmail unlawful demand of money or property under threat to do bodily harm to injure property to accuse of crime or to expose disgraceful defect thi crime be commonly include under extortion statute how do you define a blackmail one party act of demand the right to set it own sale price for a unique piece of property which it own and which another party ha express an interest in buy or of demand the right not to sell that property at any price a i see it boomer et al have find themself in the fortunate position of own something which atlantic cement have to purchase if it want to stay in busines have every right in the world to set whatever price they want there be or at least should be any law that say that you have to be a nice guy in ymy private busines deal you go on to say the plant would never have be shut down the plaintiff lawyer would have just negotiate a windfall settlement because the plaintiff would prefer an amount greater than to have the plant shut down while the plant would prefer any amount le than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation if so so what since when be the court suppose to be in the busines of prevent party from reap windfall settlement from other party when those settlement arise from wrongful act by those other party if atlantic cement do want to have to face a choice between pay a windfall settlement or go out of busines well should atlantic cement have think of that before go into busines i note that a far a the fact show boomer et al be not the party responsible for bring about thi situation that wa atlantic cement own fault for choose to build and operate the type of plant they do where and when they do and then you say everyone property right be protect the plaintiff be make whole unnecessary settlement cost be avoid a above i dispute ymy claim that the plaintiff be make whole they be in fact by court action deprive of their right a owner of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them and for that deprivation they be not make whole and again i ask since when be the court suppose to be in the busines of ensure that unnecessary settlement cost be avoid if so i be miseducated i alway think that the court be suppose to be in the busines of ensure that justice be do is boomer really be teach a infamou that really sad if it be because i fail to see how it le than completely sensible you should read the law and economic stuff first-hand instead of filter through teacher who clearly do like it for whatever inexplicable reason boomer be not be teach a infamou at least not at my school aside northeastern law usually do a very good job of hire for their first-year mandatory class such a tort where i first encounter boomer instructor who regardles of their personal opinion can and do teach the law neutrally when the student get into their second and third year in which the student a can pick and choose which course to take except for the mandatory professional responsibility of course and b be presume to be a bite more worldly and self-confident le likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidate by law school professor and able to learn from openly bias instructor rather than be indoctrinate by them the instructor tend to be more open in express their own opinion thi be especially true of part-time instructor who in real life be practice attorney or sit judge thi can be very educational sometime far more so than be teach by a somewhat cloister scholar end of aside i call it infamou because that my opinion of it for the reason i state above i believe it to be a triumph of something that i can only call economic correctnes over justice it be completely sensible only if you believe that the allege right of the owner of atlantic cement to stay in busines and avoid lose a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and the allege right of several hundred atlantic cement employee to not have their job disappear should trump the right of person who own property which wa damage by atlantic cement wrongful act and if you believe that it be correct for the court or any other branch of government to grant to private party the right to take other person property by eminent domain you like posner bill he a libertarian really i do know that what if anything ha he have to say about case like boomer of course he ha too much of a paper trail to ever be nominate by a president democrat wo like hi antitrust stance or republican wo like hi support of gay marriage and if bright law student shiver at what they do understand it easy to imagine how the pres will play it up a baby-selling i see mike godwin claim that posner assert that law and economic be applicable to everything and be the end-all and be-all when posner say precisely the opposite so it go i admit that my understand of the field generally refer to a law and economic be weak if it advocate the use of economical analysi a one of many tie-breaker factor which court may use to help them reach decision in case in which the dispute a measure by the scale of justice be evenly balance fine but a illustrate by boomer it be not fine when the court start view the economic of a case a be more important than the justice of a case william december starr wdstarr
