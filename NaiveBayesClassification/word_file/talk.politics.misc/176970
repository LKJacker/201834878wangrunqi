from decay subject re i think commercial advertising wa not allow in article matt matt freivald write in article in decay in article matt matt freivald write is an unborn child a human be at any point during pregnency in my opinion at all point during the pregnancy it be human you have to define what you mean by human be for me to answer the question a put a parallel q is a person of color a human be a you have to define what you mean by human be to answer ymy irrelevant question ye a person of color be human but i still do know what you mean by human be and you have merely beg the question without respond by try to inject the notion of race into the discussion you muddy the water without add any insight whatever the same parallel question could be is a polydactyl person a human be you still have not answer what you mean by human be please do so i would suggest that legal precedent define a human be a person whose right be protect by the constitution and the law a someone with a function brain could you cite some of those precedent for me or the basi of thi definition while the law do allow the removal of extraordinary mean of sustain life in case of brain death thi in itself do not lead to ymy conclusion of how the law define a human be however at least you define human be in a tenuou fashion that be a person whose right be protect by the constitution and the law for my answer to ymy question i refer you to roe v wade and subsequent supreme court decision which define to what extent a fetu be protect by the constitution and the law certain judge have concur that slavery be not a violation of human right therefore it be not you wo answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancy if you want a definition of human be that do not depend on the vagary of law but hold solid whatever the law may rule provide it for me i would suggest that ymy blind faith would not likely hold up if the shoe be on the other foot the brain paradigm be one that i suggest a one consistent with other legal definition it clearly do matter to you whether an unborn child ha any right or not however so the point be lose on you more irrelevancy a larry margoli point out the law ha make special exception in order to include fetuse but do not follow ymy version of human be and a he point out brain death be not a mean of determine who ha the right of the live but rather who ha die there be a significant difference what i be wonder now be ha ymy argument so fail you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancy and leave the thread you start you get answer to ymy question when you begin bait me if you recall after you have make some ridiculou remark about adrienne regard and have be correct change the subject with ymy remark about have a discussion of substance if you really want a discussion of substance why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to tos silly accussation it really do matter to you if it matter to you then why not define human be and seek some substance you not go to convince a logical person of the rightnes of ymy position unles you apply some logic and show some mean to ymy word if she be then why do the mother have the right to kill her when she be in the womb but not after she ha pass through the birth canal because a woman ha a right to have any object which threaten her health and be within the confine of her body remove the other side of the argument would give right to the fetu that would not be grant to an adult human if for example you be occupy the body of another for whatever reason or through whatever mean the reason and mean be irrelevant that other would be able to remove or have you remove if that removal require ymy demise i see no reason in law that such a removal could not be effect rather than examine a hypothetical think experiment let u examine a real though rare situation siamese twin if one siamese twin ha the other surgically remove know that it will cause death and bar some emergency where they will both die anyway it be murder is it have you any support for thi assertion furthermore ymy analogy be completely inapplicable siamese twin have an equal claim to any body part they have in common try again what establish thi equal claim beyond ymy assertion if it be merely a matter of which come first can not one kill the other since they both have equal claim what if one ha more motor control than the other do that establish a superior claim a other point out one be sacrifice for the other depend on which ha the better chance at survival again ymy analogy fail not precedence but possession make a difference here a woman womb be indisputably her own also i see you ignore my statement that you would grant right to a fetu that would not be grant a bear human be wa that due to it inconvenience you see the right to life is grant to adult human in the same sense a it should be to the foetu at some point prior to birth are siamese twin ever separate in the womb or be thi right you assert for siamese twin which i do even think be true a state or valid a an analogy one that exist after birth freivald ymy entire argument here be a failure interesting way of try to combine two essentially orthogonal concept the point be that it be murder for one siamese twin to kill the other regardles of their statu of physiological dependence or interdependence is it please cite a precedent and the basi of the rule it would be difficult for one siamese twin to kill the other inside the womb and even if it be possible i doubt that a case could be make for premeditation or neglegence note the use of the phrase it should be in my post you simply assert thing without any support ymy analogy be not accurate and ymy assertion be unsupported try thi on for size it be not murder for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb there we now have equal argument but the idea be illogical for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself a well the system be dependent on each other for life i still struggle to see anything analagou here and fail to do so of course the situation be not a perfect comparison it may well be that one siamese twin deliberately initiate oppression or coersion against the other thi be clearly not the case with an unborn child and thi last statement from you be a total non sequitur the comparison be far worse than you give it credit for are you go to let thi assertion stand on it own also or do you plan on follow up with a reason argument ymy argument be from fantasy island ymy comparison be a total failure a i have demonstrate already and ha no basi in reality neither legally nor medically and for you to assert that it be not a perfect comparison because of the impossible that of coercion or oppression be ridiculou a i say you give the analogy too little credit for failure on the one hand you start thi by say you want to take a real rather than a hypothetical situation then you fly off into siamese twin murder one another in the womb or coerce or oppress each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way match ymy version a i say before decision be make regard which twin life and dy in situation where they can not both survive and furthermore a i have already say there be a difference between an equal claim to organ and a claim that be unequal you seem to be assert that a fetu ha a claim on a woman womb when the fetu be bear what happen to it claim and by what reason do you assert it claim if a parent ha the right to choose to not take responsibility for their own child why be there law and penalty against child abandonment thi last question be irrelevant and something of a non sequitur can you establish some relevance or even some sense for it if at some point an unborn child be a human be the parent clearly have the same responsibility toward her a any other parent have toward their child again what be the relevance you have establish no sense of when that point be you ignore the significant difference between a fetu and a bear child the dependence of a bear child can be transfer to another party while that of a fetu can not a bear child do not live within the body of another human be while a fetu do thereby represent potential and often actual harm to that body a in the case of one of my participant who suffer from epilepsy and to whom pregnancy represent a significant health risk or a in the case of a woman i know who choose to continue her pregnancy but spend her entire pregnancy confine to a wheelchair and suffer great pain from constriction of some nerve and ymy argument be not an argument against abortion generally but at best an argument against abortion at some time during the course of pregnancy again a quest for common grind most of the pro-choice person i have speak to in person none of them pro-abortion activist concede that the child ha a right to life at some point that supersede all of the mother right except that of her own life a be often the case in emotionally charge issue the activist have a very different outlook from the mainstream you have answer the question the situation be not analagou the dependence of a bear child be not transfer instantaneously it take time and effort incidentally it be the pro-choice side not me argue that the government should make it easy for parent to abandon their child to the state again you avoid the question dependence can be transfer and it be not a slow a you seem to think a to the anecdotal evidence of real human tragedy there be ample on both side i would hate to be in the position of the mother in nyc who ha to tell her daughter that she lose her arm in a botch abortion attempt ye and i hate to have be the one to tell dr gunn child that he wa murder by a religiou pro-life fanatic please do try to stay relevant the kindest thing i can say about these response of your be that i can see you be try to say something but the result be a mish-mash of negligible value sez you clever comeback i congratulate you on the readines of ymy wit in article in decay write ground cover in another post delete if at some point an unborn child be a human be the parent clearly have the same responsibility toward her a any other parent have toward their child and no parent can be force to supply bodily resource toward their child even if necessary to save the child life a wa thi to make it painfully clear you be not obligate to donate a kidney to save ymy child life under law again the confusion between action deliberately take away the life of a child and inaction refuse to run out in front of a bu to save a child what happen to that claim to bodily organ where life be at stake why do thi parent now have an indisputable right to hi or her kidney when previously the parent do not by ymy standard what be different about the two situation i see i have to spell thi out for you since the mean wa too subtle for you in the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetu and a bear child you ask why a bear child can not be abandon but a fetu can and in thi case you recognize a significant difference between the fetu and bear child where the life of the two be at stake you ca have it both way action and inaction be irrelevant to the principle but you be wrong about the inaction anyway ask any of the numerou woman who post here and have bear child how inactive their pregnancy wa to have a healthy live child a woman do more than hang out eat a she choose play volleyball like she alway do drink at party with her friend etc she behave very differently and the provision of her resource to a fetu may be no more voluntary than the beat of her heart but it be far from inactive dean
