just be inform of what i feel be one of the most important thing that we could ever discus the out-and-out censorship of one of my fellow poster because some person do like what he say or think we have all see the post here by aj teel although many of u have not agree with their content i sure most of u have be at least somewhat interest in them i for one be greatful to live i think in a country where person like mr teel be allow to say what they please if i do wa to read it i can just skip on by or unsuscribe but unfortunately some person can not let other live and let live they feel an overwhelm need to snuff out the little bastard now it seem that mr teel will be with u no more due mainly to my brother and cheif net polouse ted frank please help aj teel regain net post acces and correct thi injustice are you on ted hit list are ymy thought correct is ymy account safe ha ymy sysadmin been contacted by the thought polouse i think the nlg and the aclu support person with diverse opinion not please read the follow forward message from aj teel so that you may understand thi vial act for what it be forward newsgroup subject officer ted frank thought polouse badge number summary ted win the argument by kill hi opponent expire sender a j teel sui juri ajteel followup-to distribution organization university of colorado boulder keyword nwo ted frank well well well thank to eck mark eckenwiler and ted frank my account be to be ax i gues that the information i be present be just toooo difficult for them to deal with they only ted and mark have complain to my sysadmin some unknown number of time to get me off the net in hi defense mark send only one message and it wa not that bad it ha be post in one of the newsgroup however it wa not direct at me a would be common practice and i be very good at respond vium netmail while i disagree with ted i would not send mail to hi sysadmin to get him ax name-calling wa not enough jump on every post i make wa not enough ignore specific point when they be not what the desire picture wa not enough simply ignoring me if i am such a kook wa not enough even now i do not wish to have him ax but i do wish to expres my disgust about thi argumentum ad silence-your-opponent-um i would have think he would have want me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and seem sooo wise to himself i think the issue that seem to be is the follow an advertisement apparently ted and mark think so i posted an article from around one year ago a it wa take off the net from last year if reposting an article constitute post an ad then i be guilty thi post do have a name and addres and ye a price if one have post the addres and subscription price of newsweek would that be an ad i get nothing from show thi stuff i posted a list of document show example of the kind of proof that wa requested by ted frank he then complain to my sysadmin say that i be advertise and lo and behold poof there go my account thi one have an addres in it oh no i gues that mean it be an ad if you value the alternative view i have be discuss or value it discussion even if you do not agree with it i ask that you send a note say a much to me to show to the sysadmin they rarely get ya know that user on ymy net wa real helpful or whatever they only get i do like what that user be do because please do not send the note to the sysadmin i need to take it to them in a manner that ha at least a chance of get through in my file here be hundred of response from person say thank for the info or could you send me such and such or ymy post be very interest keep it up and only a handfull of go away but i gues the fact that i have decide not to waste my time try to convince ted be a net offense tm of such magnitude a to warrant a message complain about me knock knock my name be ted and and thi be mark we from the think polouse seem you have some pretty dangerou idea here and we here to confiscate them nwo indeed gues i will have to go back to the draw board and come up with a new plan thank ted and mike hope you be happy i will be on for a few more day and then that all folk ymy comment and support be request i can no longer post to news i ask what thi ha accomplish is there some benefit from make alternative view simply vanish not in my book seem the easiest way to win an argument be to make the oppose side shut up image of waco ah but ala and all thi when i be in the proces of type in a letter to me from the tax collector say that a lien wa remove due to a letter that i write challenge jurisdiction oh well it take time to come up with the info request and i wa just get start it should be note that ted frank ha be accuse publicly over time of be an nwo supporter and ha never make an statement to the contrary further what are ted frank motivation for get me ax we all know that some person be get pay to collect info on person on the net that be of interest to the government and ted sure seem to have a personal interest in

j teel sui juri ajteel editor note the reason for post the header line from the bounce message wa to show what the problem wa and hopefully correct it ted frank it inexcusable to post line of bounce mail header to fmy newsgroup a simple four-line post would have be sufficient resolution lazlo ye i agree but my policy be to not watch everypost someone here make we generally let the net itself take care of inappropriate post by flame the user into shape which i assume thi be ment to be we cs operation do like to get involve in thi stuff unles it illegal repetitive post of gif harassment or something else that offend the community in general my suggestion be that you take it to email and explain what a post for bounce should look like or tell him to rtfm laz editor note obviously ted have no such intention of do so ted frank however teel should have mention that though hi advice be legally sound if you follow it the u of c law school you will probably wind up in jail standard disclaimer jame donald in editor note from thi sig it seem obviou that ted frank ha an axe to grind why that particular quote hmmm sure make me wonder lance w bledsoe lwb ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
