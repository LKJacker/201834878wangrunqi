from matt matt freivald subject re nln fascism with a friendly face who want to look through the bar at some reactionary liberal conspiracy theory idiot and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist support thi be very typical of the elitist liberal attitude that the person be incapable of think for themself thi elitist attitude will be the eventual undo of the arrogant liberal tide sweep america a the person begin to realize more and more that they be be treat like errant child and rob of their freedom by a bunch of utopian arrogent socialist jerk in article in new liberation news service nln write subject nln fascism with a friendly face line from new liberation news service nln subject nln fascism with a friendly face written pm apr by nln in igc nln packet fascism with a friendly face do rush limbaugh remind you of anyone daevid bornhuetter-machen the madison edge the main difference between adolf hitler and rush limbaugh be that hitler wa original and show initiative mort sahl on the tom snyder radio show abc radio network october although i find myself often disagree with the populist rationale of mr limbaugh i find him entertain and i often agree with hi conclusion the fact that he send liberal reactionary like these idiot through the roof make him all the more entertain nln believe it or not i wa plan thi comparative review of mein kampf and limbaugh transcribe rant the way thing ought to be before sahl issue hi comparative review a usual sahl wa independent and sharp a a scalpel my effort can only dream of compare favorably to mort at least it ha a fairly popular orginating premise everyone i mention the idea to think it wa either divinely inspire or at least past due for delivery those reaction be base on parallel that should be obviou to the most peripheral observer of the act of those false prophet both be note for their galvanize oratorical skill which they both use with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportion in fact limbaugh claim to have an audience of just over million almost identical to the number of vote cast for hitler in the april german election both use a myopic social perspective to build the cult and enthusiastically amputate fact from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt actually i find limbaugh oratory le than sizzle and hi debate skill sometime lack even though hi conclusion be often correct i would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hope to use concentrate political power and a load gun to force everyone to do the right thing where right be define by the elitist academic who lead the movement be show an acute case of myopic social perspective not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity limbaugh be certainly far from perfect but hi opponent in the establish body politic and the medium be the one argue for federal control of virtually all aspect of the life of the citizenry and for the elimination of local control over affair public perhap limbaugh ha a follow because the person be tire of be treat like errant child by a self-important group of arrogant control myopic person who have no understand of how life operate outside of the oughta-be inside their own hopelessly close mind the last point be glaringly document by passage in the open page of both book hitler example be when on page he claim the german nationalist terrorist leo schlageter he bomb part of a railway line between dusseldorf and duisburg be catch in the act in wa betray to france by a representative of hi government when there ha never be any factual foundation for such a statement in fact the government of both the reich and prussium a well a the vatican actively intervene to save him from execution and almost succeed ok let u take ymy word for that and work with it a nice specific incident limbaugh follow suit by make the hysterically sarcastic claim in hi introduction that in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public place god be unconstitutional of course it not god but the official imposition of particular concept of god against an individual will that unconstitutional but limbaugh be too gleeful in hi talent for distortion to want you to know that hmmm congres shall pa no law regard an establishment of religion nor prohibit the free exercise thereof liberal translation the federal government a long a it be run by liberal may force local school district to include certain iconic content in christma display while prohibit other i think limbaugh ha you on thi one it seem to me that he be argue for les imposition of the federal government into religion nice job on the specificity of that one too analysi of communication medium delete but a mort sahl also observe on the radio the other night some cloutmeister of the radical right want limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda and remember sahl be an al haig conservative these day mort might not know exactly who rush equivalent of rodolf hes be the book itself suggest ed mclaughlin the former president of abc radio and now limbaugh partner in efm medium the radio program production company but mort himself be a veteran of the talk show have host them in new york washington and lo angele he know what evil lurk in the heart of major market medium man he know that limbaugh could not have collect hi audience have not the opportunity be place on a silver platter and hand to him limbaugh earn hi money just a honestly a al capone do it almost worthy of a rico indictment ah ye it be a conspiracy of profound proportion methink that you may be a bite resentful of mr limbaugh succes because you attribute it primarily to luck how after all could anyone with profound difference of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck do you feel thi same level of knee-jerk resentment against lottery winner or do you congratulate them on their good fortune on question of social issue there be an overabundance of material in the limbaugh book that seem to echo hitler venom for example thi should be great fun since it be the liberal movement in america that be push the hardest for centralize fascist control of the person and busines indeed and mr limbaugh be the populist nemesi of that movement i have read mr limbaugh book and although it wa not the most literary piece i have read in recent memory it certainly do not contain venom at all let alone venom comparable to an individual who callously murder million out of racism on their own qualification to control society hitler out of the host of sometime million of person who individually more or le clearly and distinctly gues the truth partly perhap understand it one man author emphasi must step forward in order to form with apodeictic force out of the waver world of imagination of the great mass granite principle and to take up the fight for their sole correctnes until out of the play wave of a free world of think a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arise page a very seriou tone in that oratory limbaugh who need the medium when they get me the show be devote exclusively to what i think the phrase with half my brain tie behind my back to make it even denote the egres of mental aptitude i require to engage and demolish liberal and other who disagree with me it might take fmy or five year but i convince the medium will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of think kick and scream all the way page and respectively you neglect to mention that mr limbaugh have you ever listen to hi show btw continuously encourage hi audience to think for themself rather than blindly follow any medium icon himself include you yourself mention that he make no bone about hi show be strictly about hi own opinion he also adopt a rather satirical approach and presume hi audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousnes and he say a much thi be in contrast to the average mass-medium show in which the audience be treat a society intellectual lowest common denominator i be sure that adolf hitler wa a master of satire i be sure he wa just kid when he say that the jew be the cause of germany problem and need to be exterminate on religion a the basi of a nation hitler in thi world human culture and civilization be inseperably bind up with the existence of the aryan hi dying-off or hi decline would again lower upon thi earth the dark veil of a time without culture he who dare to lay hand upon the highest image of the lord sin against the benevolent creator of thi miracle and help in the expulsion from paradise page thi be not religion it be clearly a perverse worship of race since christ wa a jew it seem quite unlikely that hitler characterization of the aryan a the highest image of the lord fit with christian doctrine limbaugh america wa found a a judeo-christian country but my intellectual and political elite be often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion person for whom belief in god be at best a charm superstition have manage to ban prayer from the public school for the last thirty year is it only a coincidence that the quality of american education ha decline ever since page private religiou school have a vastly better record of succes than publicly fund school american history be indeed primarily judeo christian i suppose that mr limbaugh point out fact be equivalent to adolf hitler worship the aryan race i think you might be reach just a wee bite here on popular culture a a reason for social collapse hitler the fight against the poison of the soul ha to set in one ha only to look at the menu of my movie house vaudeville and theatre and one can hardly deny that thi be not the right kind of food theatre art literature movie the pres billposter and window display must be clean of the symptom of a rot world and put into the service of a moral idea of state and culture page and definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here limbaugh today hollywood be in trouble the reason be that hollywood ha forget who it audience be they make fun of person who believe in god they ridicule the traditional family heterosexuality and monagamy they disparage american hero page just a gues here but i do think that mr limbaugh would advocate government control of hollywood you should perhap call hi radio show to confirm thi i believe thi be more a criticism of hollywood and the deprave moral value it espouse not an advocation of government control of hollywood liberal on the other hand want to have complete government control of my school system so that the government can teach the person at an early age the right way to view religion and morality i believe mr limbaugh be against thi a hi satirical use of the young head full of mush hyperbole indicate on the news meida hitler the activity of the so-called liberal pres wa the work of gravedigger for the german person and the german reich one can pa by in silence the marxist paper of ly it task be only to break the person folkish and national spine in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and it master the jew page pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuate here with an implicit plea for government power to be use to break up the conspiracy limbaugh element of the medium have jump on the bandwagon of leftist cause the cynical journalist of the past ha be replace in many case by an enthusiastic cheerleader for cause during the gulf war cnn correspondent bernard shaw say cnn be a global network we ca take side cant take side if they do realize that their freedom ly in the united state of america and that therefore they should defend thi nation they be hopelessly misguide and may i suggest flirt with megalomanium page and indication here that element of the medium since career be a self-selected categorization perhap an infer percentage than represent in the populace at large ha a leftist bia do sound too unreasonable no insinuation that cnn should not report in an objective fashion only that for reporter to say that they do not have any personal bia in the situation be disingenuou to megalomaniacal you may disagree and it may well be exagerrated but it be not an unreasonable opinion and mr limbaugh go well out of hi way to make sure that hi audience know that these be hi opinion unlike most other report that purport to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree or other in a statistical sense reflect the bias of the reporter who be be disingenuou here mr shaw or mr limbaugh again you should ask mr limbaugh himself but i expect that he would oppose government control of the medium to continue these comparative excerpt be certainly possible but ultimately too depress to take in one read it be indeed depress to see such myopium and tiresome liberal arrogance liberal love to play game with paradigm a a way of discredit person who disagree with them why do you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engage in ludicrou comparison perhap the underpin of ymy ideology be intellectual only in that they exist in ymy mind not the real world after put these book down there be one undeniable fact that haunt me in the adolf hitler feed depress and frighten german the opiate of hatred of those around them in turn it allow german to hand their collective national power to the nazi in the rush limbaugh be do the very same thing distribute hatred to depress and frighten american in turn it be help the american radical right to maintain it power base a the nightmare of the reagan-bush era come to an end hop to rebuild it into their hope for the fascist state of america perhap there be a few among the intellectually challenge who percieve rush limbaugh a a hate-monger but in my experience he ha be spread laughter at the ludicrou self-importance of the left not hatred a to mr bush you may be correct about hi fascist economic lean mr reagan on the other hand do hi best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in busines mr clinton be increase fascism in america through partnership and increase level of taxation perhap you should not have skip ymy vocabulary class in grade school and if limbaugh be not a repellant a hitler it be only because the radical right utilize limbaugh a it own gateway opiate one can only wonder what the ultimate drug be they plan to hook america on hmmm seem to me that limbaugh be not in any way comparable to hitler because he ha not murder six million jew and many many other out of racism i come from a mixed-race family so i be quite well attune to racism i do hear any come from rush limbaugh the only place i hear racism come from these day and be take seriously be from the liberal left the liberal left be the movement i see try to get america hook on the opiate of socialized medicine socialized transportation socialized education etc the left already ha america hopelessly addict to that liberal drug the social security chain letter it be quite clear to me that while the hitler analogy do not really apply to either rush limbaugh or william jefferson clinton if one of the two be closer than the other it be clearly the fascist clinton the madison edge can be reach at po box madison wi thi be the same addres a idiot anonymou be it matt freivald liborgalism thinking is irrelevant integrity is irrelevant free speech is irrelevant private property is irrelevant personal responsibility is irrelevant conservativism is futile you will be assimilated these are my opinion only and not those of my employer
