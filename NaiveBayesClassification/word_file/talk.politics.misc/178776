from matt matt freivald subject re good neighbor political hypocrisy test in article mike michael a thoma write in article matt matt freivald write in article mike michael a thoma write a far a set the moral tone be concern if a community do not collectively want to put up with prostitution go on in front of their kid why should they have to if a community do not want to see proliferation of drug among their kid why should they have to by what right and do tell from the standpoint of the drug dealer or prostitute what be the difference if the gun be point by the local hick city council or the feed if something be wrong it be wrong period if it be not sustainable at a federal level why should it be ok just because the geographical unit be smaller peter nelson post a very eloquent response to thi point in so i need not consume more bandwidth here the problem with the egalitarian view be that it try to deny the fundamental dilemma of democratic government the person have a right to exercise a voice in their community yet individual have the right to be leave to themself thi be a seriou dilemma precisely because there be not much that take place in a vacuum you be seriously misuse the word egalitarian you should look the word up before you use it there be a vast difference between equal justice under the law and egalitarianism what i mean if it wa not clear wa the intersection set of liberal and libertarian philosophy of natural right and how the government and constitutional interpretation in particular fit into that philosophy thi philosophy engage in the very seriou practical error of endow the nine lawyer on the supreme court with an almost totalitarian authority completely outside of the consent or consensu of the person thi be why supreme court nomination be such amaze political fist-fight these day because he who control the court rule the country the person on the court may well be try to do the best job they can but they be at best a benevolent oligarch even if you approve of every supreme court decision ever eventually an oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear try supreme court case by jury and the problem would be mitigate a great deal those who would create broad non-enumerated government power at any level a in european parlamentary democracy and the current de-facto standard in the have essentially engage in the same fundamental mistake except that it be some different body that ha the totalitarian virtually unchecked except by plurality election death or retirement government power and why should ymy community be allow to stop my activity when i not pick ymy pocket or defraud you just because you do like it because you find it morally repugnant thi be like ask why the wind blow unles you can prove that the fact of ymy engage in certain activity ha absolutely no effect whatsoever on any other human be who ha not consent to ymy engagement in those activity very few human activity indeed fit into thi category even for those few that do who would you empower to make the judgement of what be and be not a fully autonomou activity who define pick my pocket and defraud are economic asset a person only asset or be peace of mind stability confidence in a child emotional environment security and many other thing not also a part of a person asset what gife you the right to create a moral environment that a parent strongly object to what gife you the right to create an environment of social unrest and instability if you say that what you do do not have those effect by what authority do you say that who be empower to make these value judgement how would you feel if i get a gang together and find xtianity or insert ymy favorite cause here morally repugnant and pass law to outlaw it free exercise all at a local level since that seem to be a-ok with you if the federal constitution explicitly prohibit you from do so the federal government would prevent you from do so if it do not and you could muster enough local support to pa an amendment to the local constitution by say a majority empower the local government to do so then i would have to vote with my foot and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of value thi be not an ideal situation but it be far better than the me we be mire in right now a to the gang of pitchfork and torch wield friend there be very few restrictive local law that i personally would advocate or vote for since i be of the view that exercise government power over ymy neighbor should be do with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary but i do believe in protect child from victimization by person who have callou disregard for the effect they have on other i would certainly leave a well-behaved massage parlor alone so long a it have no detrimental effect on the neighborhood you just do get it the debate be not whether you or a communitity would or would not vote away my right it be the propriety of whether that should even be an option when you define right very broadly there be no practical choice about whether person will or will not infringe upon ymy right since these right overlap even when right be define very narrowly the government ha be empower to prevent other from infringe on ymy right the fundamental question be by whose authority be that power create if you support the current situation with a natural right supreme court rather than an original understand supreme court or even better supreme court by jury you be consent to have nine lawyer in washington create those power out of the air in my fractal federalism scenario it be a broad consensu of the person the amendment proces that create those power certainly not the only cause mike but person in a local neighborhood should have a voice in what go on in that neighborhood to deny thi be to create another concentrate centralize power to keep the locality from abuse it power you mean that horrific centralize power the individual no i mean the federal government that come truck in with gun to tell the local how to run their neighborhood waco tx be a nice example in essence use a pit bull to keep a toy poodle from bite ymy leg chance be the pit bull be go to turn on you some day and you have much le defense against it than you do against the toy poodle ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary thi will never work because person be different and by their nature they will alway want to force their view on other if thi be not the case nobody would try to force their view that murder be wrong on anyone else fine when they force their view on other prosecute them until then leave them alone thi be such a simple concept how do you feel about speech code hate speech certainly could be consider an indication that the pit bull be go to turn some day should the community be allow to limit it too if not why not if you create a community where public masturbation be permit in the cause of personal autonomy have you do anything different what precisely be these autonomou activity you be refer to if you list them perhap we can get enough person to agree that they be truly autonomou and pa a constitutional amendment protect them and how do you feel about david koresh did he deserve it should the batf or a local version of same be allow to tos him in jail just because they think he off hi rocker the koresh incident appear to be a horrendou abuse of government power power possibly illegitimately obtain through a mean i would abolish the constitutionality of no-knock warrant seem very dubiou to me not to mention the mere existence of batf and the government propensity to ignore the word infringe in the second amendment thi power be uphold by the same body with it incredible concentration of power in the hand of nine person that ha uphold much so-called civil right read affirmative action legislation despite the fourteenth amendment who say anything about the public till get rid of it and get out of my face i agree about get rid of the public till are you still sure you do want to come over for coffee you might not especially like my neighborhood and i might not especially like your but at least we can agree to let each other live the kind of life we want to at the point you get rid of the public till you lose all credibility a to why you should have a say about my private affair are you sure you be ready for that money be certainly not the only asset i have in thi world if it be thi would be a bleak existence indeed michael thoma mike matt freivald liborgalism thinking is irrelevant integrity is irrelevant free speech is irrelevant private property is irrelevant personal responsibility is irrelevant conservativism is futile you will be assimilated these are my opinion only and not those of my employer
