from ddn subject waco i do want to attack anyone personal opinion and thu have not include any article but it seem to me incredibly ridiculou and pompou for someone to sit back with the benefit of hindsight and point finger at clinton reno the fbi or whomever first of all it be a knee-jerk judgement the fact be quite muddle at thi point and will likely be for quite a while secondly thing do not improve by point blame and accusatory finger pointing finger be a destructive action if everyone sit around point finger all the time nothing would get do and nothing would ever get any better and despite the tragedy we can learn something from thi if it be approach in a constructive manner do it seem that work together be more productive than work against one another thirdly it seem incredibly hypocritical to place blame give the benefit of hindsight something that those who make the decision do not have the benefit of why not give them the courtesy of acknowledge that they do the best they could with the datum they have in a very very difficult situation some response have go so far to suggest that the action be do without regard for the life of the person in the compound give me a break be part of the solution not the problem and that my opinion david
