from clinton-hq subject clinton am pres briefing by dee dee myer the white house office of the pres secretary for immediate release april pres briefing by dee dee myer the briefing room edt q why wa the postpone m myer just due to schedule conflict so a we put out the president will meet with the leader of the national polouse organization at in the rose garden a oppose to the only other thing on hi schedule today be at he meet with general vessey who a you know be on hi way to vietnam to continue work on the mia-pow issue at he have lunch with the vice president in the oval office and at he meet with the polouse organization then from to he do hi weekly photo with the variou group q a photo op with vessey m myer there no coverage on the vessey meet q why m myer why it a close meet q what about the lunch m myer the lunch no there no coverage q is he meet with any congres person today m myer nothing schedule q there be no meet m myer there be no congressional meet today no q ha the president be give any information by the pentagon or reach any conclusion about the validity of thi report from hanous any instruction to vessey on how to deal with the vietnamese on that subject m myer well clearly the report be the first order of busines it high on the agenda on something that they discus i think the president and general vessey will discus the parameter of hi visit to vietnam today but the president ha draw any conclusion about the report yet certainly it something that he want general vessey to talk with the vietnamese about first q did the president talk with any republican senator yesterday about the stimulu package m myer he speak with senator dole q how many time m myer i believe once during the day and once last night q what wa the outcome of that m myer they continue to work toward some kind of an agreement on a job package q is it ymy impression that senator dole be in any way flexible on thi m myer well i think we hopeful that we go to get some kind of job package through the senate and we continue to work with senator dole and other until we reach some kind of an agreement q did they discus the vat tax m myer i do know if that come up q can you check that m myer sure q so what be they be the president offer to scale down hi program be that what he try to do buy it down to where dole will sign on m myer well he try to protect a much of it a he can but it important to him to get some kind of a job package through the senate and through congres now and a soon a we reach some conclusion on that we let you know but at the moment he continue to consult with member of congres include obviously senator dole q is he talk to anybody else m myer i do believe he talk to any other republican yesterday q is he talk to anybody today m myer i do think anything be schedule but i would rule it out q we be lead to believe that the president call mr dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole bring the conversation around to stimulu package is that correct m myer i think the president ha contact several person on russian aid i think that it wa alway expect that the stimulu package or the job package will be part of any conversation he would have with senator dole the primary objective of the conversation wa russian aid that wa the first order of busines but it wa both q in the president mind be they link politically in that if the republican continue to reject the stimulu package he think it will be harder to sell russian aid to the american person ha he make that argument m myer i ca talk about specifically what argument he might have make the president be obviously commit to both he like to see a job package to the american person first but a you know we outline the detail of additional russian aid last night in tokyo q but do the president believe that the stimulu package will make it more difficult to persuade american to vote for russian to accept a vote for russian aid m myer i think that the president be go to continue to work to pa the stimulu package to pa a job package and we still hopeful that we get some kind of job package through the congres q is it fair to say that the president be negotiate now with dole m myer he discuss option with him q on the stimulu be it ymy understand that over the break some democrat themself have leave the support that they have earlier for the package the stimulu package m myer i think we still have wide support in the senate for the job package q but specifically that you lose democrat other than shelby m myer i do believe so there ha be a vote q what about kohl q kohl and feingold m myer there ha be a vote yet and we continue to work with senator to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote because we believe that a majority of the member of the united state senate support the package q if you be worry about kohl and feingold why do george mention milwaukee project the other day m myer i think george point out a number of project in a number of state that stand to be fund or to lose fund if thi job package do pa q no democrat laughter m myer i let you draw ymy own conclusion q do he plan to talk to dole again today or any other republican again today m myer there nothing specifically schedule but again i would rule it out q do he plan to put out any more pres release to any other state today m myer what we do be we in the proces of break down the benefit of the job package state by state i think it entirely feasible that a we sort of be able to sum those up we send out pres release to the variou state that suggest how their state would benefit from thi package q will you share those with u m myer sure a we do yesterday q do you have copy of the one you send m myer ye we make those available yesterday and we certainly can continue to provide them today q dee dee since yesterday question and subsequent story about the vat what further consideration of thi issue ha be give m myer nothing change since yesterday i think the president comment on it thi morning to say only that it wa something he know wa be consider by the task force and that he ha not make a decision on and i do think we have anything to add to that q but he also say that busines and labor group be tell him they support it can you tell u m myer i think that there ha be i not go to speculate on who support it i think the president say that there ha be some support among busines and labor group i do think he say he wa directly contact by them q are we to take that to mean that the administration ha sound out busines and labor group on thi m myer i think there be plenty of public discourse on thi over the year and even recently but i do think i want to add to that q in february though the president say that thi wa something to be consider or year down the road what ha happen between then and now to cause thi administration to change it mind m myer i think a we say yesterday it be something that the work group be look at they consider a wide variety of option on everything from fund to specific option that will be cover by the president health care plan the president ha not take it up yet ha not make a decision on it and beyond that i do have anything to add q you have answer the question it wa be consider by anyone in the white house after the president comment in february and george reaffirm that in a brief q and then suddenly q what happen m myer the work group a we have say throughout we instruct to consider a wide variety of option across-the-board and one of the thing that ha be talk about and that they be clearly consider be some kind of a value-added tax q but the president himself take thi off the table dee dee and suddenly it reappear and thi go to the credibility of thi administration in a way what ha happen in the meantime m myer the president ha not look at thi it ha be present to him again yet the work group be look at it a they look at a wide variety of option and no decision have be make q and it raise the question of how independently the task force be work m myer the task force wa instruct to consider all option and they take that mandate seriously and they consider all option q but that not the impression that the president leave in february the impression he leave wa that thi wa something that wa long-range to be look at year down the road the clear implication of hi remark wa that thi wa something that wa not on the table not an option q if it change i tell you q bring him on q and you repeatedly refer to the president remark tell u that those be still in operation m myer it change and we tell you laughter q but that what alouse rivlin comment and donna shalala comment be about i mean that seem like an orchestrate effort because you have two independent cabinet officer m myer i would no alouse rivlin not a cabinet member first of all second of all it wa not orchestrate but clearly they both say yesterday and in the last couple of day that it something that be look at we confirm that yesterday and i do have anything to add to that q is it because he ha very few option q is thi something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the president about in other word ha the president himself personally rule it out and it now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table or be it in fact back on the table have be place there by discussion with the president m myer it be not the work group mission at thi point to convince the president of anything it be their mission to put before him hi option and to explain the benefit and the cost and the basic pro and con of each of those option i think that they will certainly present the vat to him in that context and at thi point he not that presentation ha not be make but it something that he will hear and he ha not make a decision on q they will present it to him a one of hi option though he specifically rule it out m myer correct q dee dee be thi more than a trial balloon is thi a seriou consideration that the work group be give to thi form of taxation m myer it simply a statement of fact the work group be consider a wide variety of option on a number of issue relate to health care reform one of the option that they look at be the vat q dee dee when the work group be examine thi possibility wa thi on the table during the same time period that you be tell u that it wa not m myer i do know what the specific time of their draft of option be i do know q who wa tell you that it wa not under consideration m myer i wa refer back to the president comment q have they discover that the sin taxe wo raise enough money to fund the core benefit package m myer no there no decision that have be make on how to pay for the health care plan q i ask whether the projection m myer there a number of option depend on how the plan be structure you ca decide how much the plan be go to cost until you decide what the plan be go to look like and so you ca discus what finance option have be rule in my out until you know q dee dee we be tell that they have a computer model on a number of possible package m myer correct q the question be whether they have now determine whether sin taxe would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package that be not a very difficult computation m myer it be a question that you know that we not go to answer until there a number of option be consider it depend on how the package be structure the exact detail of the package and the finance mechanism use to pay for them be all among the decision that have yet to be make q and when the president ha be meet with health care hi health care advisor which we be tell he ha be do m myer correct q they have never once say to him these be ymy fund option include the vat he ha never hear the word vat in hi m myer i be not go to comment on the specific nature of the daily they not daily but the quasi-regular brief q well you have m myer i have not other than to say that he not consider the vat and i think that be a true statement q no but you say that it ha not be present to him a an option m myer correct q that do mean he ha hear about it m myer i not go to get into the detail of what discuss i think that statement stand for itself q specific dee dee when you say he ha look at it do you mean that he ha look at it in term of pay for medical coverage or ha look at it in general because back in chilicothe he wa very specific in define how it work what the advantage be the whole thing it sound like m myer but that wa i think in chilicothe if you go back to hi remark there it wa a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure and i think the comment be generally in reference to the overall economic plan but clearly it something that he think about in the broad context i mean that wa clear in chilicothe what i say be that in the proces of the work group it something that he ha consider yet it something that the work group will present to him among the number of option and that no decision have be make and i not go to comment any further on the detail of the meet where health care issue be be discuss q it ymy statement from thi podium that no discussion of thi ha take place you say that no option that the option ha not be present to him m myer that be correct q do you stand by do the white house still stand by george statement in march that thi will not be in the proposal m myer no decision have be make we have nothing to add to what already be say q let me follow up here do you stand by what rivlin say yesterday that if any kind of vat be to be use or consider that other change to the tax code would have to be make so that it would be le regressive m myer i not go to comment any further on what might happen if q but do you stand by the previou conversation in february that if there be to be a vat i think the president say you exclude food and energy m myer i not go to comment on the specific structure of a decision that ha be make q wa the president aware prior to donna shalala comment yesterday that thi wa under consideration by the work group m myer i do know specifically what q could you check for u because that a real important credibility question m myer sure q since the task force wa bring together thi issue ha be discuss at the begin and throughout a one fairly painles way to raise a lot of money were you all keep in the dark wa the pres office keep in the dark over the past month and a half when you be deny that a vat tax would be consider that it wa actually on the table over there a an option m myer i think we say all that we have to say it be something the work group be look at the president ha not make a decision about it yet and beyond that i have nothing to add q well sorry dee dee there be still a couple of question that we be go to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here your primarily what we ask be if you all be not tell at all that thi thing wa be consider while you be come out here and tell u that it wa not or if it a case that you be come out here and deliberately mislead u m myer i do believe that anyone ha ever come out here and deliberately mislead you from thi podium ever ever q ha anyone try to shade it a little bite to indicate something ha anybody tell anybody to come out m myer we not try to shade answer or deliberately mislead anybody i say what i have to say about thi issue q all we be try to find out m myer i understand what you try to find out and i give you the answer helen q we try to find out what change what make it an option again that the m myer the work group be give a broad mandate to investigate all option and they be do that q ye but it wa an option before how can you investigate it if the president ha take it off the table m myer it be something that they obviously consider and the president ha not make a decision on q ye but he take it off the table in february m myer working group be consider it they present it to the president at some point and he make a decision q why would they consider it if he ha take it off the table m myer it clearly on the table q ye but he take it off the table did he change hi mind m myer it back on the table bill q did he change hi mind m myer he say thi morning that he ha make a decision about it he obviously know that it on the table it something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on thi we let you know q so he must have change hi mind right m myer at some point it will be look at i mean q dee dee there like two option either he change hi mind or the work group think they authority exceed the president m myer the work group be give a broad mandate to look at all option they do that q are you go to put out hi income tax m myer ye there will be something available on hi income tax probably later thi afternoon hi return will be available q will there be any kind of brief to go through it m myer no nothing plan i think someone will be available probably not in a brief set but to walk you through the question q we use to be walk line-by-line through the presidential tax form m myer i see those brief laughter q could we have one m myer no i do think there will be any kind of a formal brief but there will be somebody available to answer ymy question about it q did they file a joint form m myer ye q when do he file it m myer i believe it be file today q dee dee be there go to be a backgrounder for miyazawa m myer no there will be a readout after the meet q no backgrounder today m myer no backgrounder today q thi be complicate stuff we need help laughter m myer we ca give you taxe and miyazawa all in one day it too confuse laughter q vance and owen have open the door on the use of force in bosnium they both say that a they never rule it out and b it might be necessary now do that influence ymy think on whether or not to change ymy approach m myer there be no change in my policy toward bosnium we have alway say that we consider q but do that impact upon ymy decision are they person whose opinion would carry weight with you m myer they person whose opinion carry weight certainly i mean the president support the proces that they initiate but there be no change in my policy for bosnium although we consider a number of option right now if the serb do come back to the negotiate table if they do sign on to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional option which we be say regularly q one follow-up question then we can not get a straight answer from anyone in the administration why do you not set a deadline for the serb can you tell u the strategic or tactical reason for not give them a deadline to come to the table m myer we continue to put pressure on them every day q which do work so m myer well we think it be have some effect we go to continue to tighten sanction a you know we support the omnibu resolution we expect that to come to a vote on the q you say it have an effect can you give u any documentation m myer i be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanction and thing like that q there be no you have not be able to provide anybody who can tell u that the sanction have have any effect in bosnium serbium ye in bosnium no m myer i think that they have effect in serbium and we think they have some effect in bosnium and again i be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the detail of that if you like q we would like to hear from someone who can show u what the effect ha be in bosnium we have the brief on all of the terrible thing that be happen in belgrade but we have see anything that indicate an impact on the fight can you provide something along those line m myer i will see what i can get you q on the extra russian aid that christopher announce thi morning where be that money come from m myer we have to work with congres on the detail of that package q so that would be new money that you would hope to get m myer ye that new money in addition to the billion announce in vancouver so i assume that you all have see the package that wa announce thi morning in tokyo by secretary christopher q is there a concern though about offer something which you have to get in congres i mean that wa the concern with vancouver you do want to do that m myer the concern with vancouver wa to do something immediately which require money that wa already approve in the fiscal budget what we look at now be a little bite longer-term plan to build on top of the billion that we announce in vancouver thi clearly will require congressional approval or some of it will anyway and we go to continue to work with congres to make that happen q to what extent ha that be vet or agree to by congres m myer the president ha have a number of conversation with member and will continue to work with them a thi proces move forward q wa christopher able to put thi package out with a fair degree of understand that you will be able to get it through congres m myer it wa create in consultation with congres q in meet with the law enforcement official be that do that have a set speech and a goal a direction m myer ye the president will talk about and the law enforcement organization be endorse the president job package they believe particularly the summer job package will help give kid something to do q who be they m myer it member or leadership from three organization napo which be the national association of polouse organization ibpo which be the international brotherhood of polouse organization i believe and iupa which be the international union of polouse association q will the fbi chief be there m myer the fbi chief no q or any other federal law enforcement official m myer no it will be the president and these national law enforcement organization leader q do the billion announce today include the million that in the fy budget for disarmament m myer no the nunn-lugar money be separate q so thi would be the million that in the budget already plu another billion m myer i believe all of thi be on top of the million already in the budget q is thi go to be part of the supplemental or fiscal m myer we work with congres on the exact fund mechanism on exactly how thi will be pay for q thi billion on top of m myer on top of million on top of the million nunn-lugar money we announce earlier q and thi be what prompt the president to call bob dole it wa on thi tranche not on the previou money he wa call bob dole m myer correct q is there a brief on miyazawa m myer there will be a readout after the meet with miyazawa tomorrow q dee dee on a totally unrelated matter some republican who be active in the chamber of commerce be complain about thi new cozy relationship between the white house and the chamber of commerce there be the town hall meet the other night the satellite and all of thi relationship do the white house feel that you get too close to these chamber of commerce m myer that an interest charge laughter after how many year of democrat be accuse of not pay any attention to the chamber now there be those who would accuse u of be too close i think that interest but no we thrill by the support we receive from the national chamber and local chamber acros the country and we continue to work with them on thi and other initiative q what the statu of the president think about go to thi democratic retreat m myer it on hi calendar i think he almost certainly go q all three day m myer we have figure out exactly when he be there yet
