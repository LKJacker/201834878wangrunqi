from gld gary l dare subject re eight myth about national health insurance pt ius daniel b case write gld gary l dare write daniel b case write gld gary l dare write okay but do doctor willingly testify against each other in malpractice case when they do go to court obviously absolutely essential to prove malpractice it use to be impossible to get doctor here to do that a possible advantage of the u system you wo hear about from the ama my doctor monopoly be exactly the same a in the if not more powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rate but i do know an answer to thi one anecdotally my friend who be md include my main bud from high school talk about how hard it be to turn state witnes against someone else no direct experience there though also in some circumstance you may have to sue the insurance plan person here after all sue health insurance company all the time i hear about a guy in albertum who come down with some rare eye disease that he have to take repeat trip to seattle to get treat it cost him and hi family something like and the province year later still ha only reimburse them for or so well what american private insurance plan cover travel expense since my public insurance plan be publicly accountable one can raise a stink in the medium to try and extort benefit beyond which one be entitle hey not albertum fault that he life there if he live in cheyenne wy hi private insurance would tell him to go to hell for the travel expense and that that an hmo would have just keep quiet and let him go blind well yeah tell u about the national defense medical centre outside ottawa it serve the same purpose a the bethesda naval hospital since not all hospital can provide everything maybe they have some stuff that other do ottawa population be only a quarter million if you include the surround county my point wa that something that should necessarily remain unpoliticized ha become very politicize to the detriment of it mission i do think that thi ha be show with the dmc the problem be in a system where hospital annual budget be approve by the government how do you keep political consideration out of medical decision i bet that if you an mp or mpp or good friend with one you put on any hospital urgent care list no matter how minor ymy problem which be ok unles you someone who get bump off the list for some bigshot person of influence will get their way in any system american or european it the golden rule he who ha the gold make the rule but to what extent do it affect the system and why be an urgent care list necessary in the first place it worth think about it regular practice in a hospital to figure out who need to get at what facility do american have to arrange in advance for operation too i think that there be two standard be apply here and that canada ca give beverly hills-style treatment to everybody it not a big brother list it more like call around town for a table for dinner yeah but private nonprofit foundation have to make money somehow especially in the hospital busines ye and the tory in ottawa be try to make them do that rather than hope for a bigger grant from the feed and their province the next time around whether it use mop a couple of week longer or even sell service to american remember my system be cash base and since my health care infrastructure be overbuilt except in specialty that require larger population to generate busines why not the alternative be close unused ward busines whether canadian would be thrill at the prospect of their own health service cater toward american who would be will to pay more than they do be another issue entirely it must be note that they say they be do it partly because their grant from the province be get smaller if those grant be so insubstantial why the need to attract foreigner to make up the difference you answer the question yourself private nonprofit foundation have to make money somehow and i think that it about time that they act like the private hospital that they be personally i feed up with canadian socialist try to tell everyone that their health care be free when we be actually buy insurance that one at you bob ra the gdp figure be combine public and private expenditure for total outlay and be compile use the same method by the oecd that yield the figure for the but do the u figure include dentistry and optometry where the canadian one until recently anyway do since we have alway be evaluate in an oecd style i do see how remember oecd count both private and public fund and in canada like france and germany of health care spend be private fund not the basic health insurance money so what happen if the health care system financially collapse how they be collect premium and i an advocate of have copayment like the french do in their system well if you spend more than you take in you go bankrupt it that simple if the provincial insurance system find themself pay out more than they get in revenue they wo be able to pay for everybody primary care ye the infrastructure will be there but will everybody be able to continue use it at the same rate minor copayment can flush out abuser remember that my system be only an insurance policy but my cost be rise fast enough to ensure adequate last year quebec user-fee proposal come out with the number of a the necessary hike that could be do through a copayment rather than give the qma a raise and it not contract time yet a far a i can tell from upus clarinet even the new reform party a breakoff of traditionalist from the conservative with a mildly libertarian faction hold my public health insurance a an untouchable but that just a few person have to be remind that it not free the average be more fiscally naive than their american counterpart on issue like these but no mention of copayment anywhere to be see but cut public spend all over the place and bring back the death penalty with little haste if elect i know that for pete sake i live right on the border i know the canadian system be socialize medicine unlike britain nh sorry it just that i even run into person from buffalo and from michigan who do know the point be that mean that if the money run low in the plan you out of luck unles you can afford it yourself yeah but there be a lot of lead-time and a health-care crisi that would preclude it if provincial government a bad a some of them be heck we have the ndp clean up a spend me make by the conservative in saskatchewan embarassing can be so irresponsible there be still reallocation health insurance be so important that it about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent insurrection outside of the hockey rink right now attempt to get the system and it user to learn good habit be be treat like cod-liver oil would the private insurer take up the slack they be under no obligation to of course they could eventually make money again but if what you say be true they be loathe to do so and out of practice in handle such basic service too some of the company provide extra insurance be subsidiary of american company and their parent provide full insurance down here regardles all firm up north can easily turn on cable tv to see how well the american firm be do by be involve in basic coverage the private firm be make too much money after have get rid of basic coverage they run around pat them self on the back for their own cooperation in provide extra for those person who deserve it yeah but eventually it go to create a kind of two-tiered effect that will be noticeable after a while like in britain most american be fearful of a single-tier system seriously there be few area that have sufficient population for a system like what the french have a health policy prof shea ha cite study in the nejm that indicate have a population of be necessary for adequate competition and in canada there be only fmy city west of the great lake with that population or larger anyway the number show that cost have hold steadier than those in the and bar any future chernobyl-like crisi sudden transient in spend be unlikely in fact the health allocation be one of the most well-behaved sector of spend up north so any talk of bankruptcy be talk-radio fodder far away from the border if the province hit fiscal rough spot and have to cut back the thing private insurer have to offer will seem le and le like luxury and the gap will be more and more noticeable thi wo be overnight and something like thi would force canada to have a system more like the french one but that not a bad thing and the change will be minimal add copayment and frustrate the socialist chant hey it free gld je me souvien gary l dare gld go winnipeg jet go gld selanne domi stanley
