from gld gary l dare subject re eight myth about national health insurance pt ius daniel b case write gld gary l dare write i hear about a guy in albertum who come down with some rare eye disease that he have to take repeat trip to seattle to get treat well what american private insurance plan cover travel expense well it wa just the travel expense it wa the whole treatment when you buy insurance where you live it be base on the local rate tourist come from say utah will find that there be a difference in what their insurance will cover fob provo and what they get stick with at lenox hill or mount sinai if they fall ill in the big apple but to what extent do it affect the system and why be an urgent care list necessary in the first place it worth think about it regular practice in a hospital to figure out who need to get at what facility do american have to arrange in advance for operation too i think that there be two standard be apply here and that canada ca give beverly hills-style treatment to everybody it not a big brother list it more like call around town for a table for dinner but american need far le advance time to book operation it would depend on where you live downtown toronto or mile british columbium just like cheyenne wy v boston ma again geography rear it ugly head since my health care provider be private they depend on an adequate market size in order to sustain enough busines since my health care professional have equivalent take-home pay to their american cousin it not that they be pay too little to provide service whether canadian would be thrill at the prospect of their own health service cater toward american who would be will to pay more than they do be another issue entirely it must be note that they say they be do it partly because their grant from the province be get smaller if those grant be so insubstantial why the need to attract foreigner to make up the difference you answer the question yourself private nonprofit foundation have to make money somehow and i think that it about time that they act like the private hospital that they be personally i feed up with canadian socialist try to tell everyone that their health care be free when we be actually buy insurance that one at you bob ra true but i wa think anybody compete with the province to offer basic health coverage i remember read that that sort of private health insurance be actually illegal in canada i have only hear american say that it illegal but i could be wrong just have never hear it from a canadian source my private insurance ha recently balk in quebec when the liberal propose privatize some aspect of routine care also my insurance wa put in place when no ndp labmy government be in power in any province to derail the effort they want real socialize medicine you not buy insurance so much a be coerce into one insurance plan no it be optional a it be optional for doctor to accept it there be isolate religeou community in particular that ask for exemption and one e-mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verify for me that it be indeed negative option i gues that you can argue that there be a right to have a particular insurance but so far i not come acros that up north and i take pain to keep tab with news from home and that turn the private insurer offer the frill into an effective cartel-they do really need to compete because a you put it they in a win-win situation and they guarantee to turn a profit believe me they probably have orgasm when they figure that out and accord to my sister the yuppie they pat themself on the back to the point of ungraciousnes at chamber of commerce luncheon interesting side note-have any new insurance company start up-from scratch-since medicare become standard in canada i actually have doubt that any new one have emerge since ww i no scratch that there be a few in western canada and quite a few in quebec a part of the quebec miracle out with the nationalism in with the french capitalism la groupe de cooper ante build a new tower by the eaton store at les terrace and if you be able to catch urban angel on cb crimetime you see it a the well-lit one with double-turret at the top a for ontario which still dominate and anchor busines up north canada be a very old-money kind of place and the free trade agreement saw a lot of odd alliance labmy union and establishment old money who want to preserve their traditional monopoly on one side and entrepreneur and internationally orient business and professional on the other the final trudeau administration and the first mulroney government have a high percentage of nouveau rich who know what it wa like to make ymy own money and that motivate the mcdonald commission under trudeau which set up brian initiative macaroni wa against free trade he do a head count of hi caucu after the election it not really insurance if you do have alternative well you have to realize that in my society that like say that it not really national defence because you ca hire ymy own rambo squad instead or even opt out a a pacifist btw there be alway pacifist in the news argue about their portion of taxe but never person argue over health insurance alternative and we talk about a pres that be hostile to whomever be in government regardles of party one of their few redeem characteristic it seem also in the april globe and mail there wa a letter from the director of trauma service at st michael hospital in toronto respond to an article on a study compare heart surgery in californium and canada in which some canadian doctor worry that american analyst would seize on the result a proof that canada ration vital service the doctor i ca recall hi name say that canada be ration vital service a any physician can plainly see he say that a system in which person be refuse treatment because they ca afford it be no different from a system in which person be refuse treatment because the government ca afford it a a result of deliberate underfunding of the health insurance plan in fairnes he do say that both the u and canadian system be in the same situation the only way to hit at the canadian system be transient period of high demand which be more a function of the doctor monopoly tight fist on the licence an obviou difference be that in such a transient period the ration be of the nature of a mob battle over cabbage patch a we see recently a oppose by ration by ability to pay but the former be a transient situation and if a large body of insure patient be to deluge the californium health infrastructure the same would result ration among the insure population with smaller market there be much le flexibility when deal with my insure population than californium which by the way ha more person than canada in a much more dense area so he be correct in that the resource be fix for a particular time window or a a function of the doctor monopoly licence accord to the market steady state in either case a for be refuse treatment the government of the day would be shred to tatter if something like that be to happen canadian can be geographically bad too not realize that their health care be private while only their insurance be too many person have buy into socialist trype that we have socialize medicine i know i know the monopoly power of canadian doctor often lead them to overstate the problem with the system in order to get more money from the government another case of businessman once scratch become socialist right a i point out above but ha that just shift the locu of the problem from one place to the other it ha really solve it either way the transient situation be hard to deal with since the change in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of person to fall sick esp in the light of disaster chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease a doctor need year of train plu internship and specialty train person too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their insurance when they really do need to that why i argue for deductible and copayment rather than education which be what most canadian fiscal conservative be argue for the leftist ah just let spend yeah right also note that only a few province cover prescription under some high dollar threshold in most it ymy private insurance that cover it just like in the still it all add up in the oecd measure in fact buffalo may be the only place in the u where person get don cherry joke we get the sabre fee a a replacement game on espn tonight the devil local metro ny coverage supplant the main espn game the ndp clean up a tory spend me and just when i think i understand canadian politic yeah it a sad story and saskatchewan tory leader grant devine ha be on a nonstop pr campaign to save hi sorry butt the sask ndp have take a neo-conservative turn like hawke gonzalez and mitterand do ha anybody consider follow singapore example and go to a system where the company and the state buy basic and catastrophic coverage for everybody and then you also have an ira sort of thing to which you and ymy employer can can contribute for medical expense only it would tend to discourage you from overuse it the medical ira would have limit use a you need a lower catastrophic threshold else there still be a drain on the public purse if someone exhaust their ira also singapore ha a much more autocratic mentality which ha seaped down into it mass if singaporean that i meet be any indication i do mean any disprespect here where they let you just die one of the good thing about be the last country to create a national health care system should we decide to be that we have everybody else mistake to learn from that true the question be how much leeway be there between the approach and the second-most capitalist approach of canada france and germany seriously there be few area that have sufficient population for a system like what the french have a health policy prof shea ha cite study in the nejm that indicate have a population of be necessary for adequate competition and in canada there be only fmy city west of the great lake with that population or larger but there be many city in the u with that kind of population ye many and pretty close to a lot of smaller town or not too far from a bigger town just take a look at a detail atla or better take a flight from pittsburgh or rochester to toronto my first time acros lake ontario to nyc i wa amaze by the increase in density and the toronto region be the densest in all of canada there wa one about a group of doctor in calgary who have open canada first us-style mrus clinic a an alternative to the provincially own one it about time i rag on my own doctor friend a to why they do invest in their own private practice in the end it their money but they choose to spend it on america cup pipedream and that none of my busines a for provincially own for sure it against the law in canada for government to be directly involve in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser vation what that term actually mean be that the facility get by on public grant to meet shortfall from lack of use no kid medical practice itself be much more conservative up north my own best friend do two clerkship at the mayo clinic in rochester mn and be no stranger to high tech medicine but hi boat come first there be some person express concern that it wa the first wedge of two-tiered health care and that it might violate the canada health act no it probably socialist whiner who be offend that we have private practice and alway have they can all take cash anyway so why not have a particular facility the canadian big government mentality often imagine government where it do not even exist since the french and german have become more entrepreneurial and le laidback without sacrifice their culture and value then canadian can do the same a i point out above the law state that it be illegal for the government to provide any health service except for the military and native look nobody stop the clinic when they plan on the mrus nobody stop them when they buy it nobody seem to be stop them from use it either much ado about nothing thank goodnes that hockey playoff have start while it seem currently unjustified there wa one anecdote tell by the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mrus he show an image of an injure knee which happen to belong to the manager of the bank who approve the loan he say that without it the guy might have have to wait a month or more at the provincial mrus then another length of time for treatment after which the muscle would have atrophy and rehabilitation would have be that much harder if that be the first whiff of two tier i do know what be i certain there be exaggeration somewhere because the gao study of canada cite often on usenet do not find acces to mrus to be a problem i bet the doctor be rely on person have listen to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff hi chest a bite there be already a few treatment regimen for knee injury without rely on mrus unfortunately i have a few and i not a banker gld je me souvien gary l dare gld go winnipeg jet go gld selanne domi stanley
