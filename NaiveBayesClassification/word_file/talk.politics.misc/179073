from clinton-hq the white house subject clinton pres briefing by george stephanopoulo the white house office of the pres secretary for immediate release april pres briefing by george stephanopoulo the briefing room edt mr stephanopoulo a you know the president be go to come out at with ymy indulgence i think what we like to do be have the president award the national teacher award first and then have the teacher leave or whatever and then he make a statement on waco and take a couple question so if we can just hold off go live and all that until that do it probably will work out a lot better q if you give u the time that the problem q we get a two-minute warn problem mr stephanopoulo ye it be a problem it about q the teacher would walk off and then mr stephanopoulo i think that i just try to work thi out here i think that the best way to handle it q can i ask you a series of question about the way the president handle the notification yesterday mr stephanopoulo sure q did you for instance talk to the justice department about who would come out and discus what have happen in waco and whether it should be the attorney general or the president mr stephanopoulo why do we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of event on the contact between the justice department and the white house a you know and a we say the president speak with the attorney general on sunday sunday afternoon they have a good discussion about minute the attorney general inform the president of what she want to do he raise no objection obviously she have the implicit authority from the president to go forward he raise no objection she go forward they have a discussion of a general nature about the incident again yesterday morning around the president speak with the attorney general again they have a brief discussion over what wa happen in waco a you know thi wa before the fire break out at the compound and i think that wa why there wa some just some confusion i think that she wa confuse in her mind before and after the fire not the actual day when they speak then there wa a number of contact at a number of different level in the white house yesterday afternoon between the justice department and the white house they be inform u of their decision what they would like to do there wa an fbi brief in waco the attorney general have her pres conference the president then issue a statement after that frankly yesterday afternoon you know there wa a fair amount of confusion over exactly what wa happen on the grind in waco and i think that we want to be very careful not to have the president say anything until we have a much better sense of what wa actually happen on the grind once we be fairly clear on what wa happen on the grind in waco the president issue a statement he speak with the attorney general again yesterday even q at what hmy wa that mr stephanopoulo it wa quite late i believe it wa after he return from the holocaust museum he take a tmy of the holocaust museum last night q and he go out to dinner mr stephanopoulo i believe briefly ye he go to dinner and then he speak with the attorney general last night i do know the exact time i think it wa relatively late and he just say i think a dee dee ha report that he just want to tell her that he think she handle a difficult situation very well that she do a good job in a tough situation and that she should try and get some sleep he then again speak with her thi morning about the follow-up in waco and about what they go to do thi afternoon a you know the president will have an announcement to make at q did he ever talk with webb hubbell yesterday last night or thi morning mr stephanopoulo not to my knowledge no q wa webb hubbell the point man for the white house mr stephanopoulo webb hubbell be the general white house liaison and several person talk to webb the attorney general wa run the operation q did he tell her that she should sleep well that she have do a good job or he just tell her that she should get some sleep mr stephanopoulo i think sleep well do a good job i do know the exact word i think that sound right q i mean sleep well ha implication a to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not mr stephanopoulo well i mean i think everybody feel badly when you have a situation when q i understand that but whether the issue of blame be bring up in that phraseology mr stephanopoulo i think that the spirit no it ha nothing to do with that the spirit with which it wa offer wa that the entire administration and certainly the attorney general have to face a very difficult decision a very difficult situation yesterday and that he think that she have handle it well a best a she could and q well do he think it wa mishandle mr stephanopoulo it wa just speak of warm word to a friend q do he think the situation wa mishandle mr stephanopoulo the president q in retrospect mr stephanopoulo the president stand by the decision of the law enforcement agency the decision of the attorney general he accept full responsibility at the same time i think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happen do a full review and make sure we do what we can to make sure thi do happen thi kind of thing do happen again or at least we know how to handle it q how much do he know about what she wa go to go ahead with i know that she make the case to him explain outline the case for action did she say to him on sunday precisely what action mr stephanopoulo i do think it wa specific operational detail a to what wa go to happen i think that they have a general discussion about the action about the advisability of action i think a she note he ask a few general question just try to get a sense of how thing be consider but it wa minute-by-minute detail of how the operation q well wa it we be go in is it we go to use tear ga i mean what mr stephanopoulo i believe it wa that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound and hopefully spur them toward some sort of movement out q george wa there ever a consciou political decision make or even a discussion about distance the president from mr stephanopoulo not at all i mean we be in close contact with the justice department the president accept responsibility for thi at the same time i mean we just want to be very very clear about how thi happen and be a factual a we could be on how the decision be make it be the responsibility of those on the grind to make recommendation the attorney general ha operational control over thi the president obviously accept responsibility for all of thi and he stand by the attorney general q george there wa a report on the television today and i do know more than that one of the member of the cult have say go into a courthouse that the fbi have start the fire and not themself there wa also a picture yesterday on the tv of a smash into the build where the fire break out and my question be be the white house absolutely certain that thi fire wa mr stephanopoulo all the evidence we have be that thi fire wa start by david koresh and those inside the compound every bite of evidence we have q did the president ask the attorney general why do thi now why thi particular date and do he ask about possible consequence of either death or injury mr stephanopoulo i do know the specific question he have general question about how the decision wa go about be make q those be general question and do he ask generally why now mr stephanopoulo i think he ask have you consider all of the consequence have you consider the recommendation i do know if he ask the question why now i do know if he ask that specific question q did she tell him why now in term of the stuff that come out since then about the information provide by the listen device about koresh get increasingly more violent mr stephanopoulo again i not certain how much specific detail they get into i know that she generally say that thi be the recommendation she prepare to make i mean the decision she prepare to make it base on the recommendation she wa receive from the field and after intensive question of those involve again i do not know how precisely detail it wa beyond that q what be the president understand why yesterday one of the person who go into the compound a couple week ago come out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have tell law enforcement person something that precipitate thi action why yesterday mr stephanopoulo thi be the first i hear i think what we can go to be what the fbi and the attorney general ha say there be indication that those inside the compound be at some danger it wa clear that the negotiation have break down and it wa the judgment of the expert involve in the negotiation that the situation wa not go to get any better at all there wa also some concern over the vulnerability of the agent themself who have be work long beyond the time that these team normally have to work and a the attorney general ha say there wa some concern over the fact that they do not have replacement in place who could stand in for them and there wa a concern over the safety all of these factor come into play they also consider the advice of a number of psychologist and other expert on david koresh and those in the compound i would just go back to what the attorney general ha say you have to make the best judgment you can give the information you have at the time they do obviously we all regret the los of life it a terribly unfortunate situation we all wish it could have turn out differently but that do take away from the judgment that be make at the time q george when do the president know that they be go to use tear ga wa it before the assault on the compound mr stephanopoulo i just do know i do believe he wa give a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go i just do know q along that point george can you say whether the plan wa present to the president by the attorney general a a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday mr stephanopoulo i think it wa present a a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and we all hop a a way to move some of those out and bring it in it wa present a tomorrow be d-day thi be it q is the president satisfy that a he have all thi relevant information necessary to make a decision and b that janet reno have all the relevant information necessary to make a decision mr stephanopoulo oh i think he satisfy that they be act on the best advice and the best information they have and he not second-guess it in any way whatsoever q george wa there a gap between conversation between the president and the attorney general in other word they speak at and they do speak again until clinton get back from dinner at mr stephanopoulo i think that likely ye q did he call her what time do she call wa there a gap between when she call him i mean wa he at dinner when she call and mr stephanopoulo no no no i think he call her last night i could swear to it but i believe he call her last night he just want to talk to her q what wa go on mr stephanopoulo not that i know of no q what do you know about the situation now everyone ha perish who except eight or nine and do you know any of the other detail mr stephanopoulo i do know any more detail than the fbi report in waco q watch cnn or how wa he keep track of what be go on if he wa talk to hi attorney general how wa he keep track of what wa go on here i mean with all due respect to cnn be that how he wa do it mr stephanopoulo no there wa also a i say several person in the white house be in constant contact with their counterpart at justice to have the full and complete information q who be those contact i mean wa it mack mclarty webb hubbell how wa the president be keep inform that not a mr stephanopoulo i believe mack wa in contact with webb i speak with several person at the justice department i believe bruce lindsey speak with person at the justice department either bernie or vince wa also in contact at different time during the day with person at the justice department we be fully brief and fully inform q we be tell thi morning that the president may have speak a chance that he may have speak with webb do you know if that true or not mr stephanopoulo i think there a chance he may have i do believe he do but i think there certainly a chance that he may have at some point i do believe he do i think that the last contact he have during the day yesterday directly with the justice department wa the phone call with the attorney general but the white house wa fully inform on a minute-to-minute basi of what wa happen in waco and what wa happen at the justice department q george who decide that the brief would be do by the attorney general mr stephanopoulo the attorney general q did you or do the white house communication staff be you ever involve with that decision mr stephanopoulo no we be tell about it q did you ask her to go on nightline and macneil lehrer and all that stuff wa that part of mr stephanopoulo no q there wa no advice from the white house at all about her she wa on all night all day laughter mr stephanopoulo ye and she do a very good job q why do you decide to have the president reaction to the situation be only a write statement which be traditionally the white house way of distance the president from the issue not have him appear a personally say anything mr stephanopoulo well that wa the intent at all a i say we have to we want to wait until we have all of the information at hand the president be also make a statement today the president make a statement yesterday morning the president ha be fully involve q after thi turn into le than a successful operation the only statement from the president wa what wa on paper after the attorney general have already give what amount to the major fact in thi mr stephanopoulo well it wa the first statement from the president not the only statement from the president number one q after the mr stephanopoulo number two well the first number two the attorney general q he give a statement early in the morning when the thing wa start to move mr stephanopoulo right and he give one yesterday and he give one today now the second point q it just happen thi wa a write statement with no sort of communication policy or think proces involve it wa the president want to put out a write statement mr stephanopoulo knowing what we know at the time we think it wa appropriate for the president and he think it wa appropriate to put out a write statement express hi regret and express hi support for the attorney general q why wa it not appropriate for him to personally do something mr stephanopoulo well he do personally do so that be hi statement it a statement under hi name q george yesterday during the brief you do say the president take full responsibility for what happen mr stephanopoulo i certainly do q no what you say wa mr stephanopoulo that just not right susan q well i think you can go back to the transcript i mean unles i mi something mr stephanopoulo i love to q janet reno say that she take full responsibility and you say that she make the decision that the fbi mr stephanopoulo and the president take responsibility absolutely q took responsibility all right mr stephanopoulo check the transcript q considering how little wa know about what wa go on inside the compound and even now how little be know why be washington call thi a ma suicide mr stephanopoulo well i think that know what we know now and give all of the action of david koresh before and during it be painfully clear that those there be under hi control q it stretch it a little bite where the kid be concern though be it george mr stephanopoulo i think that that be an entirely different matter i mean i think that david koresh must bear responsibility for the death of those child absolutely but he clearly wa intent on create some kind of an apocalyptic incident and that what he do q you still operate completely on assumption right i mean you have no evidence or you know of no evidence that thi wa ma suicide mr stephanopoulo we have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound which lead to the death of those inside q i do quite hear it thi might be ann question i do quite hear it but at what time do clinton himself put out a statement on thi i know dee dee say some stuff on thi at but the president put out mr stephanopoulo at q right after the even news go on the air mr stephanopoulo no right when we have all the information we be work on it q dee dee confirm thi morning that the investigation the president be go to announce be go to be an administration-run investigation why not have someone from the outside to make sure that it not color by those who would have a political stake particularly those at the atf whose action have already be mr stephanopoulo i think that clearly the atf and the justice department will bear responsibility for the investigation that not to rule out a be often in investigation like thi have some sort of independent involvement a well but it will be run by the treasury and justice q are you confident that you will not have any problem get mr stephanopoulo absolutely q george do the president reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meet with janet reno and who else in the white house sit in on that meet anyone else from justice mr stephanopoulo i do believe anybody else wa there at the time it wa a phone call on monday it wa a meet q sunday mr stephanopoulo sunday it wa a phone call it wa a meet i believe he might have be there with bruce but beyond that i think he just talk to the attorney general q george you say that in that phone call she say that we want to go in and take action a you say that will force him out what do he think she wa talk about if he do know about tear ga what exactly wa hi idea of what he wa approve mr stephanopoulo i think he wa approve an action to increase the pressure on it do matter how she do that mr stephanopoulo no no i mean q what information do he have in term of how thi would proceed presumably he would have want to know not minute by-minute but in a general sense mr stephanopoulo i think he know that thi wa the recommendation of those on the grind and the recommendation of the law enforcement agency i just do know q what be thi when you say that thi wa the recommendation mr stephanopoulo the action to increase pressure i do know exactly what he wa tell whether he wa go to be tell that the tank wa go to go up to the leave wall and punch a hole in the window or whether he wa just tell generally that they be move forward in a way that would increase the pressure i just do know q it hard to imagine him not ask though q that janet reno present him with a her best advice about what they should go forward with he would have agree mr stephanopoulo he wa he do ask some general question about the advice and recommendation he give at the same time and i would repeat that thi wa base on the unanimou recommendation of the law enforcement agency involve q george it would seem that thi question about just exactly in what detail the president wa inform about the nature of the operation be go to come up again here and elsewhere can you take that question and mr stephanopoulo absolutely ye q get the answer and come back to u with all of it mr stephanopoulo ye q can you tell u that there wa never a meet a strategy session where you and other decide we will put out a write statement from the president and we will have janet reno be on all of these television broadcast mr stephanopoulo never never q and you never call the justice department and say to anyone or janet reno you the one who need to be out front explain thi mr stephanopoulo not once q it just happen that way that she wa the spokesman that no one ever saw bill session until mr stephanopoulo she make a decision a attorney general that it wa important for her a the operational officer in charge a the person who make the decision to go out and take the question on thi tragic incident q she have no guidance from the white house at all mr stephanopoulo we certainly do object q but do you laughter no i sure you do object but do you suggest it wa thi a plan mr stephanopoulo no absolutely not q a strategy mr stephanopoulo no q did she clear it mr stephanopoulo no q did she notify you mr stephanopoulo we certainly know about it q what happen to thi great detail proces you have for clear and talk to every public information officer and every under every rock and every place in government that something a major a thi could have occur without a discussion between you and the public information person at least at the justice department mr stephanopoulo the attorney general make the decision and the attorney general want to go forward it seem like a good decision it wa a good decision she do a good job q let me ask it thi way george if in hindsight how you would handle it mr stephanopoulo i think it wa handle very well q you would change a thing if mr stephanopoulo change what q the way the white house handle any part of it from start to finish mr stephanopoulo well i think that an awful broad question and we certainly go to have a review one of the reason for the investigation be to look for way in the future that something like thi see what we can learn from an incident like thi and see what we can learn about how to handle them if you talk specifically about the issue of the pres conference no there would make any change at all q two question first of all on her go on tv no white house person or outside medium consultant come up with thi idea it just very reminiscent of what you guy do during the campaign mr stephanopoulo how so q i think of like watch clinton on nightline after the draft story watch clinton on mr stephanopoulo there absolutely no comparison yesterday there wa a law enforcement incident the incident end in tragic death of many many person the attorney general wa involve in that decision the attorney general make the decision to do that she felt it wa her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the question of the pres in order to make sure that all of the question be answer and she do a fantastic job q the second question be do a someone who know clinton a well a you do can you understand why it sort of hard to believe that he might not have ask some detail question about what she intend to do in other word she come and she say i go to put pressure on them it hard not to see clinton who fairly intelligent and inquisitive ask how q what kind mr stephanopoulo both the attorney general say that he do ask question he do ask general question i do have a minute-by-minute account of the conversation q how long a conversation mr stephanopoulo i think it wa about minute q telephone conversation mr stephanopoulo ye q george wa the federal cost of thi standoff ever a consideration in term of step up the pressure mr stephanopoulo i do believe so no q george you keep say that the president take full responsibility but then you refer to it a her decision do the president not accept the fact that a commander-in-chief it be ultimately hi decision mr stephanopoulo i do know what thi ha to do with commander-in-chief thi wa a law enforcement action not a military action and he clearly take responsibility for the decision of the law enforcement agency involve take in hi government i mean i think there just no ambiguity about that q but be he accept it a hi decision a well a her or be he say it her decision there a difference mr stephanopoulo a a matter of fact it wa her decision he do not object to that decision he clearly take full responsibility q george thi brief ha go on just a little over minute and a you can see a lot of thing can be exchange what exactly do they spend minute talk about if it wa just very general that a long period of time in a phone conversation mr stephanopoulo it be an awful long phone conversation it wa a very important phone conversation i think brit ha ask that we take the question and i say that i would q one of the thing reno say last night be that the buck stop here i think that wa her direct quotation do the president agree with that in thi case mr stephanopoulo the president say he accept full responsibility i think what the attorney general wa say be that she make a decision that she go to accept all the responsibility that come to her and she not shrink from that at all but neither be the president q at any point in the conversation last night between the president and the attorney general or thi morning do she ever offer her a resignation mr stephanopoulo not to my knowledge q even before the fire wa out yesterday there be some republican on capitol hill call for an investigation is the white house at all concern about the time of those request try to make political hay out of thi situation mr stephanopoulo no and i do want to cast any question about the motive of those who be request investigation we want an investigation and we have a full and complete investigation q in what forum will you answer brit question will you put out a write statement will you the wire how will you answer the question that you take mr stephanopoulo i just not sure q george can you remind u what the president wa do all yesterday afternoon where he wa and what meet he wa involve in mr stephanopoulo i have to try and remember he have a series of meet with different member of the staff during the afternoon he wa certainly monitor the situation in waco and get periodic report on that a well he do see some on cnn a well i believe he saw a fair amount of the fbi pres brief a well q and those report would have come to him from mack mclarty would they do you think mr stephanopoulo mack talk to him bruce talk to him i talk to him q george to follow helen question in their conversation thi morning do they discus at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign did he say i do know why you felt the need to say that i here to reassure you that you do have to do thi did that come up at all mr stephanopoulo i do know if it even come up that specifically i know that the bulk of the conversation wa discuss where do we go from here and what form the investigation q the do talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about mr stephanopoulo well i believe she wa ask a question q and her response wa if the president want me to i will mr stephanopoulo which would be i think the standard response that most cabinet member would give i mean it a conditional statement q have a need to talk about whether personally about whether the president want her mr stephanopoulo i do know if they talk about it i mean what i learn about the conversation wa that it wa largely about the investigation itself and thi just do come up i do not ask the question if they talk about q will you take that with the brit package mr stephanopoulo certainly laughter q george for the record do the president want her to resign i know dee dee answer thi morning mr stephanopoulo absolutely not he support janet reno she a good attorney general she do a good job she handle a difficult situation extremely well q george do the president feel that he and janet reno be let down by the unanimou professional advice from the law enforcement expert on the grind mr stephanopoulo no and the president be not second-guess that decision and those recommendation in any way that be not to say that he do regret the los of life everybody regret the los of life in thi situation but the best judgment be make in a difficult situation base on the best information we have q george the conversation wa the one on sunday be that correct mr stephanopoulo ye q how long wa the one at yesterday morning mr stephanopoulo i do know i take that question too q were these outside expert that they be consult with or expert within the atf and the fbi mr stephanopoulo you have to ask them i just not sure i know that there be several expert q and also why be there replacement for these person is the unit that small mr stephanopoulo again i think it be a very small highly-specialized unit but i think it one of the kind of thing that the investigation will examine q george be there a factor here involve the fbi director normally a president when he want to get information do only ask the attorney general i know the chain of command but president talk to their fbi director in thi case throughout thi entire siege he ha not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to bill session who be from waco and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do mr stephanopoulo i think he talk to the fbi director well in the begin of the situation when it first break out in waco at the same time the attorney general bear the ultimate responsibility and he wa get fully brief from the attorney general q do you think the ambiguou situation that director session be in ha some impact on the way the president be brief and on the way that all of thi evolve mr stephanopoulo not at all i mean it perfectly appropriate that he be brief by the attorney general and that the attorney general ha supervisory authority over the fbi director and that follow the chain of command the pres thank you end edt
