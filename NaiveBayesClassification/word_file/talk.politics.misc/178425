from daniel b case subject re eight myth about national health insurance pt ius in article gld gary l dare write the difference in the litigation environment be reflect in the fee lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice be really why we spend le use the most expensive approach of pure insurance then why do we really need national health insurance then would it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance and maybe that not such a good thing i also read somewhere that it be next to impossible in canada to litigate against the health system-clas action suit be nearly impossible and you ca sue the provincial health official at all part of the deal for use the all-insurance approach like the french and german do hey why do they criticize france and germany is it because too many person take french and german in college to make the accusation stick wa to preserve the doctor independance since the provincial wing of the cma be the one that go to bat when the fee schedule hike be present the politically-bent doctor be just cackle when they realize the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialize medicine approach like britain national health service oh no do let the ama know about thi they have enough power a it be ask most american whether they like the doctor lobby to get more powerful for non-life threaten thing market argument adequately cover why certain procedure be in scarcer demand i have md friend who ca make a live a specialist back in manitoba not due to the insurance rate but because they wo get enough customer the cma medical monopoly grip on doctor licence a in the u aside so they must move to larger place however thi do not refute debunk of wait line for urgent and routine care a ha be do in the by consumer report health policy study cite by prof denni e shea on usenet cnn nyt etc well yeah tell u about the national defense medical centre outside ottawa theoretically it limit to service personnel but some study i hear about have suggest that about half the patient there be civilian who not only have connection but be urgent at all the problem be in a system where hospital annual budget be approve by the government how do you keep political consideration out of medical decision i bet that if you an mp or mpp or good friend with one you put on any hospital urgent care list no matter how minor ymy problem which be ok unles you someone who get bump off the list for some bigshot would national health insurance mean that american who are now fully insured might have to settle for les in canada provincial insurance cover all health cost except dental care eyeglass prescription drug ambulance service and private hospital room so many canadian do end up buy some private insurance a policy to cover all of these thing run about to a month hmm how much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of gnp spend on health care if dentistry and optometry be include in the account maybe canada spend proportionately just a much on health care a we do of course the one thing to note be that in the case private insurance offload the basic coverage to the public sector they realize they be keep extra insurance for thing like room v ward accomodation dental glass etc for corporate or personal benefit they have nothing to do with you if you want to be cover for basic care at that point they would even consider a voucher approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policy to make up the difference in the federal guideline and market stuff so what happen if the health care system financially collapse bob ra the second least popular man in ontario warn ontarian a few year ago that if they do stop cross-border shop in such huge number the service they expect from the province just wo be there in a few year fortunately for them and le fortunately for the retailer here in western new york the canadian dollar go back to a more realistic value he do say so but i know he mean the ohip what would happen if hi warn turn out to be the truth would the private insurer take up the slack they be under no obligation to of course they could eventually make money again but if what you say be true they be loathe to do so and out of practice in handle such basic service too would free care encourage person to run to the doctor for every ache and pain person who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical bill still canadian who pay nothing at the doctor have a lower per-person health bill than we do it be free in that there be no deductible nor copayment two thing which i advocate to make the canadian insurance look more like real health insurance which actually it be i know that when work in albertum ontario and quebec i wa aware that i wa pay for health insurance in toronto ohip fee be list on my pay stub manitoba do not collect at paycheque time but only annually at income tax time build into the tax rate only fiscal naif will proclaim that it free along with the canadian left for that be part of their brainwash agenda would that it be free american would start another revolution if they have to pay taxe at canadian rate is the private health insurance industry just too big and powerful to kill dismantling the health segment of my insurance industry would be politically thorny in the quiet word of one advocate for a national plan some firm now sell more than billion in health insurance they put up a hard fight not only ha the industry grow eightfold since canada shut down it own health insurer but my government leaf politician more open to lobbyist than do canada parliamentary system health insurance do exist in canada and in western europe it just that it do cover basic care you can opt out in canada and germany but you have to go uninsured a a result because there be too few other person that do so no market when private insurance realize how much money they make without the risk involve in basic insurance neurosurgery versu deluxe amenity have to call granada tv to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone private hospital room they start to pat themself on the back for their social responsibility in quebec last spring a consortium of private insurer publicly warn against any think of privatize routine low cost part of that province public health insurance plan again i doubt american would like give the insurance company that much power i half wonder if the canadian health insurer do go along with the province and the federal government year ago because they know that there wa a good chance of the public system go bust in the long run and then afterward they could clean up okay thi sort of contradict what i say higher up but it another possibility they have an add bonu when argue against government involvement in their industry-a they could then point to it failure instead of just cite theoretical principle
