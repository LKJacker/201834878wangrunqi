from veal david veal subject re re fillibuster in article hallam phill hallam-baker write in article david veal write in article hallam phill hallam-baker write in article david veal write well ye and no the federalist paper be propaganda and it be therefore difficult to determine precisely what maddison etc be up to from them there be a couple of way to look at them one be we want you to support thi constitution so we say anything that we think will appeal to you or the more straightforward thi be why we think what we suggest in thi constitution be a good idea you clearly consider the former to be the primary situation the point be that they do not make pain to point out where the consitution may have be aginst the new yorker interest also they do not want to raise opposition by base their advocacy on unpopular principle horror appeal to popular principle can we perhap a the question of whether the constitution might have be write to appeal to the principle rather than a you appear to believe it wa write with something else in mind and propoganda put out by it supporter but let be honest about something here when wa the last time you bring up all the valid point against ymy own argument or be they simply propogranda we ca know what phill really mean because he obviously use argument design to convince well i know hamilton wa a dye in the wool monarchist and probably the authoritarian extreme to jefferson democratic impule but what would you suggest a a mean of determine their opinion on the government if we do consider what they write about the government i do propose that any mean exist for determine their true opinion thu their true opinion die with them and be of little help today their opinion have not the slightest bear on the matter though only their argument these be true or false regardles of who say them or why if they true or false regardle of why they be say why on earth do you make a point of call them propogranda that would seem to be irrelevent the difficulty that most u poster seem to have be in consider that their argument may have be flaw or no longer apply to modern society oh i have no argument with question them i do believe they no longer apply but that because i think most of them be good argument i not entirely happy about the situation because they be obviously only apply to a minority of the time but i do think that alone be sufficient to invalidate them if they be alive today the one opinion we could count upon these man to expres be that a careful study of the mechanism of government be necessary and that an ongoing improvement of the same be require they give their opinion in certain area and have be prove right in other area they get it wrong they ensure that there wa a mechanism to adapt and improve the consititution thi can only happen if there be a willingnes to accept that the structural problem within the u political system may require constitutional change a a solution since the constitution be the basi for the political system most change in it would require constitutional change in thi particular case however the fillibuster be a matter of procedure and tradition it only should have be make part of the constitution if the senate wa le powerful than the house of lord than we almost have to state that the house of representative wa also in fact they both be because the british government have much greater power than do the american system in principle no in practice ye in principle no that they have le power of that they should have have le power the british government today be theoreticaly dependent on the will of the monarch by convention any monarch seek to exercise that power be depose the subtly be that the prime minister be not able to identify their politic with the national interest in the same manner that u president regularly do phill we discusing the power of legislative house while the prime minister be member of parliament he be more analgou although badly to the president now please explain to me how the house of representative be in principle more powerful than the house of lord or the senate but in practice be le are you suggest that the writer of the constitution really intend for them to be more powerful but gosh darn the thing wa ratify before they realize they forget to put those extra restriction on the senate in i disagree the system be not too slow it wa simply design to handle le than it ha demand that it handle a somebody in washington put it whose name i forget congres ha become everybody city council one reason for that be that at every level the government be render unable to come to decision these decision be push up to the next higher level instead not at all a any entry level political science course will tell you person who want law implement will alway choose the level of government to attack which present them with the best chance of get what they want with national interest group it be simply a very rational thing to do to want the federal government to enact a law rather than the state les person to persuade and le contribution to make why do those concern about abortion primarily concentrate at the federal level simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefield be win by extension the same extend to insurance medicine and most other question local government ha not fail in that it ha do what it should but that it be dominate by local interest thu non-local interest who want locality to abide by their rule ca get their rule past the local government thu since they get more clout only in the wrong place they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose it will on the lower i mean let get real here do we really need the congre of the united state decide that x traffice light should be on thu and such pattern or that carjack need to be a federal a oppose to a local crime the more person want the more congres will take power to sell it to them for their vote i do think the rise of special interest be coincidence with the increase power of congres congres be more than capable of quick action and ha more than enough power and time on it hand if it confine itself to what it original jurisidiction wa and allow more local autonomy if they be to start from a social welfare model instead of the current no state subsidy motto they would be better place a it be there be plenty of state money be hand out the problem be that it be distribute on the basi of power in congres and not on the basi of actual need bingo the higher up the governmental ladder the le actual need matter because political power can be concentrate at higher level while person with le cloud only find themself reduce to in effectivenes in order to set up a school project in new york state you have to pay off the other state with pork defense contract agricultural subsidy etc or to be precise of the state since you need to beat the filibuster then why not simply leave new york education to new york i remain unconcinved that there be any state in the union which be not capable of educate it own child if that what they want to do and if you leave it to them you only have to worry about the pork in that state and since industry ca concentrate their political power and wealth rather they must divide it among the state to try and get what they want individual voice have more relative impact the problem with the fillibuster be not that you must buy off state but that the congres ha acquire too much power to sell pork it be not a case of the system of government they create fail but that it be operate under a set of condition they specifically want to avoid namely a concentration of power it would seem then that the proper thing to do be not to reduce the power of either house in some attempt to grease the wheel all you get then be a system which move quicker to do stupid thing it would make more sense to make more decision at a local level no you have to break the machine free of seizure before you can redirect it but why on earth should we want to redirect it you say yourself that you have to sell pork to get thing through congres if congre ha le authority to sell pork and retain it authority to enact national legislation within it grant jurisdiction the pork problem be significantly reduce the current block on power simply absolve congres of any responsibility to come to a decision the current block essentially state that inaction be preferable to action thu it the system be weight against action considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce it decision by force i consider bia against make those decision a good thing pushing the decision lower in the pyramid wo work unles the lower level be le corrupt in most case they be worse not better the difference with the lower pyramid be that a they have more legal legitimate authority in most matter under my constitution than the federal government and b at those lower level power be harder to concentrate and c you get the benefit of not impose new deicison on everybody at once you get to see them try out without a national decision congressional action usually treat the entire country a a whole yet even with similar problem in different area different solution may be call for and while i often do agree with the decision my local and state rep make at least i have a better option of go to the city council and shoot my mouth off i much rather the majority of law be make by accessible person who hang around and end up have to put up with them rather than somebody far off in washington with half a million or more constituent i curiou what you base ymy assumption that lower level be more corrupt i fail to see where any restriction imply or otherwise be place on the veto it could just a easily have be read a a mean to put a check on democratically popular but unwise in the executive opinion policy since we be argue from the federalist paper i would point to them phill you bring up the federalist paper we be argue the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of senator should be allow to hold up a bill you claim the senate wa suppose to be a far le powerful house and i contend there wa nothing in the constitution or other write which indicate thi which wa when you bring up that we ca decide what the founder want base on the federalist paper you argue against them i never argue from them i have primarily refer to the constitution which place only very small restriction on the senate than for the house the u constitution gife almost no reason a to how it should work the only part where a reason be give be the right to bear arm ammendment where the well regulate militium justification be ambiguou the constitution be a nuts-and-bolt document the delcaration of independence wa the high-brow reason there be a couple of other example though such a the reason for the power to tax and the reason for the power to grant permit both in article i section that the veto wa mean to be an exceptional measure follow from the fact of the senate if the president wa mean to revise legislation then there would be three chamber of the legislature not two furthermore the separation of power would have be much le distinct to a certain extend i do believe the veto ha become something it wa intend however i also believe it be inevitable consider the congres own abuse of their power to make bill say whatever they want them to say unlike most person i think we should be worry about the veto which be fine but of the problem in congres which almost necessitate it abuse there be no limit in the constitution to the president veto power regard what a bill be for previou president have use the veto for any number of reason most usually have something to do with their agenda i be really curiou how you single bush out a the president who abuse veto he ha the record for veto bush phill that absurd bush have veto one of which wa over-ridden go read up on fdr if you think that anything resemble a record why be it not a reasonable restriction because senator be the magic holy number upon which law must be base if senator feel safe enough with their state constituency to stand up and fillibuster be that enough to indicate there a sufficient question a to whether a law be a good idea or not to re-evaluate it up to a point the fact be though that when the majority be oppose by a minority the minority should not be allow to win by default why not what be inherently wrong with bias the system against action historically governemnt action in the when deal with issue with a bare minority and a large minority have not be successful when you in a position of impose federal power on diverse person why should the federal government not have to get through something more than a bare majority why one earth should be sufficient to enact a law which cover million person in very very diverse place and live in radically different condition why a super-majority be require because the bill at issue be a money bill relate to a short term proposal now we switch from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill i do see how it make a difference it be not a change in the law where a presupposition in favmy of the statu quo be arguable sure it arguable argue it however require to bring it to a vote ensure that they have to have a good argument something that be base solely on party line any system in which the simple majority be give absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignore i do not see thi a a positive thing and for all that i sure the republican be look for pork a much a the democrat they get some legitimate objection to the legislation in question so instead you consider a system under which the minority automatically win to be superior no i be completely happy with a system which require a minority for action since history be a history of carve up population group and implement piece-meal on minority i feel minority should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about and be hardly a tiny minority i do advocate the minority be capable of initiate actionm but i see no problem with bias the federal system against action david veal univ of tenn div of cont education info service group i still remember the way you laugh the day ymy push me down the elevator shaft i begin to think you do love me anymore weird al
