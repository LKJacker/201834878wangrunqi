from rigg bill rigg subject loser wa re stop put down white het male in article tree of schnopium write in michael michael rivero write i do know what you a a white male do i do know what white male a a clas have do they invent the light bulb the automobile the airplane print with movable type photography computer the electric guitar anasthesium rocket power space flight the computer electricity the telephone tv motion picture penecillin sp telescope nylon and the x-ray machine two glare error here first white male do do anything a a clas individual white male invent those thing which mean nothing to white male a a whole second you neglect to mention charle manson hitler mccarthy jack the ripper ted bundy and a whole slew of individual who have do horrible evil thing if white male can take the credit for my fellow white male boon we must also take the blame for my fellow blight i claim we deserve neither credit nor blame for these thing we be tell by congresswoman barbara jordan that we be biologically incapable of compassion she full of shit we be tell by susan brownmiller that we all rapist and that all we be she full of shit we tell by catherine comin that a false rape charge be actually good for u she full of shit we be tell by the feminist lawyer that we be not to be trust with child they full of shit we be tell by newsweek magazine that we be poor sport if we complain newsweek be full of shit the point lady and gent michael be not entirely correct in hi theory that because member of my race and gender make great advance the race and gender a a whole deserve more respect than they receive white male do deserve to be treat better than they be be treat but not for that reason and the male-basher he quote be repugnant hate-monger no better than the chauvinist they despise so no one right a usual white male need to wake up and realize that they be unfair ye but everyone else need to wake up and realize that be unfair right back be disgust racist and sexist why ca we learn to treat everyone fairly without generalize what stupidity gene make thi so difficult i like to buy the world a clue the word that be miss in thi whole discourse be not the b word or the h word or even the n or w word it be the l word loser that right when we boil all the crap out of thi argument it be all about winning and losing and nothing else let me explain remember the eighty no excuse nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they be too young to remember ronald reagan yet the eighty be about how america learned to win once again then would you know we win so well that there wa nothing leave to win no cold war to endure no nuclear holocaust no more world to conquer we forget about outer space long ago the kind of overwhelm no hold bar succes that kill alexander the great ye there be a few little problem along the way stock market meltdown here an s l bailout there a few revolt and crazy middle eastern dictator to contend with but a tacitu would tell ya the god augustu never have it so good in the meantime there be guilt for win maybe a fear that one do deserve one bounty or succes so there be a kinder and gentler type of politician these day bill clinton affirmative action and lot of discourse about person who do get it for those of u in the win busines thi kind of talk be mildly irritate but there be still no suggestion of lose but what do we find now to put it mildy the stereotype of my white male non-winner be woody haye in the rose bowl punch out photojournalist when those californium fruit and nut steal another one with a hail mary pa in the fourth quarter the whole idea behind yard and a cloud of dust be to wear ymy opponent down until he collapse in the final period but woody just use hi fist uzzy seem to be the weapon of choice these day who be d-fen anyway the answer be a plain a the horn rim on ymy face the guy be michael dougla pose a a loser thi be know a controversial cast but that baggy short-sleeved white shirt sure do look natural on mike do it gordon gekko will never look the same though woody alway dress that way did we really expect gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe without put up a fus what we be start to lose sight of be that bash d-fen be the same game a bash that poor african american slug that clint eastwood use to blow away all the time a that arch-wasp male gender george c scott declaim american traditionally love to win they love a winner and will not tolerate a loser and so on the political implication be simple if a many socialist and democrat do you consider society a finite pie to a apportion in some equitable way then you have to worry about who be a winner and who be a loser to tell whose side you be on that could be black woman today asian homosexual tommorrow and ye indeed white man some yet to be determine day when the balance of the pie ha finally swing against that minority or you can just blow the whole thing off and say a do most conservative and all the libertarian and act be if you do care who win and who lose in some case you might say something about make sure the game be fair equality of opportunity not of condition in the latter case you might be able to identify yourself a a neoconservative or a neoliberal depend on how much you want to limit the pot either way you go the way of the winner be no longer the way to be popular at least after you graduate from high school but you still be popular at high school reunion but it beat be a nerd a i would imagine michael dougla would now agree and in the long run it be the only way to go even in hollywood which treat loser worse than any other place in america except for new york and washington and even in columbu ohio which produce alex keaton but no champion football team in the eighty and the first quarter of the ninety i like to see more winner in thi society regardles of race gender religiou preference and sexual orientation maybe we should even let a few more of them be white man we should definitely let the buckeye win the rose bowl someday bill r the only proposal in the senate that i my opinion do not represent have see fit to mention be particularly those of my employer or praiseworthy or particularly scandalou one any government agency it seem to me that the historian foremost bill rigg duty be to ensure that virtue be remember and to deter evil word and deed with the fear of posterity damnation tacitu annal iius
