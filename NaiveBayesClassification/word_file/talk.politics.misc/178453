from steveh steve hendrick subject re limiting govt wa re employment wa re why not concentrate in article mr grinch write in article steveh steve hendrick write okay let me try to explain thi when one vote for such a creature a a senator or worse yet a president one vote not for specific policy but for a general package which must cover all issue for or year a such one influence be highly dilute i might add that even if one be free to vote on individual regulation the vast amount of time require for consider a particular regulation combine with the very small chance of one vote make a difference would make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision with respect to specific regulation i afraid that i lose the thread here i do suggest that all government regulation be subject to referendum so i do follow the comment above sorry but it strike me that it be the only feasible approach what be not feasible be a wholesale attack on all government regulation and license that treat cut hair and practice medicine a equivalent task i not sure what you mean by feasible in thi case do you mean that be impossible in priciple or merely that it would be undesirable in fact i mean that an ideology that treat all government regulation a equally undesirable and seek to abolish all regulation be unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate furthermore i be suggest that such a plan be not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort actually the only area of public spend above that strike me a generate substantial support among libertarian be polouse and defense it be an interest aside that a commit a libertarian claim to be to a principle of non-coercion the only area of public spend that they frequently support involve hire person with gun hmmm you say thi a if it be surprise yet in fact a necessary consequence of libertarian philosophy all non-coersive function should be deal with privately therefore it follow that the only function remain to the state be the coersive one no i not surprise i just think it interest that on one hand libertarian assume a limit government can be decree yet on the other posit an entire government make up of person who carry gun i realize that many libertarian assume that such a government will be counterbalance by a fully arm citizenry but it be worth note that widespread civilian ownership of gun do not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government iraq perhap you have may i suggest that you consider that revolutionary frequently generate support by act a protector of geezer mother and child government that ignore such person on the grind that we do have much to fear from them do so at their own peril much more likely it drunken teenager the group in questionare more likely to be worse off during and after a revolution than before in the unlikely event that you miss my earlier sarcasm let me say thi directly the idea that such program a social security or afdc should be consider defense an idea which ha be advance in th and other newsgroup be so absurd a lie a to be unworthy of consideration do you seriously dispute thi yup sure do but since i also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare article i section i will to justify such program on that basi i do want to seem patronize but you still seem to be labor under the delusion that under a socialize economic system it be reasonably intelligent and honest person like yourself who make the decision i feel any third party add to a transaction be every bite a likely to be ignorant or corrupt a the buyer or seller i do expect you to agree with me but you explain why you feel i wrong well in the first place i do support a socialize economic system i think within limit that capitalism be a fine idea but it be not the case that any third party be a likely to be ignorant or corrupt a the buyer or seller there be multitude of example where such a statement be demonstrably false regulation of stock market transaction that provide a reasonable basi for buyer to avoid fraud be only one example jsh mr grinch steve hendrick domain steveh one thing about datum it sure do cut uucp uunet isc-br thor steveh the r hofferbert ma bell
