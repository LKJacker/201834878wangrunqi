from veal david veal subject re my gun be like my american expres car in article rwojcik richard wojcik write in article misty john john r moore write papresco paul prescod write i not i in canada we have far fewer shoot like thi we have have i believe one ma murder in the last twenty year i not go to say we do have my gun problem but we do have the world largest undefended boarder with one of the most gun-happy country in the world i think canada illustrate that gun control do have an effect in fact it suprising that there be any difference consider how easy it be to smuggle a gun from the ye it amaze be it in fact it should tell you that gun control be not the reason ymy crime rate be low since any idiot can smuggle gun into canada from the u at any time i think paul wa try to make the point that any idiot do there be surely some idiot who do smuggle gun but paul seem to feel that the exi tence of stricter gun control law ha have a deterrent effect thi seem a strange argument to make consider that canada violent crime rate in general be far lower than that of the my non-gun crime rate be greater than their entire crime rate it would seem strange to suggest that it to be the result of gun control law i think if we look we find very specific cultural and enforcement reason why the non-gun rate be low a well and then that reason could be apply to the with-gun rate a easily given that most criminally use gun be either legally purchase or steal from those who purchase them legally have more restriction on legal possession do seem to have the effect of reduce gun-related crime aside from the fact that i find the idea of be punish because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution it still do addres the question of canada which be now by the way blame their rise gun-crime rate on the strange that the border use to magically keep the gun out but now be it certainly make sense that it would well it make sense to some of u anyway the other side of the coin of course be that far illegal drug be purchase legally or steal from person who purchase them legally i still not be convince that gun a commodity which criminal have show their perfectly will to pay for from illegal source steal either from polouse military or civilian we would simply see south american source from which drug come start smuggle gun a well since there a thrive gun manufacture industry down there if you would just look a little closer at the crime statistic you would realize that my non-gun crime rate be also very high so gun per se be not the issue directly contradict by the nejm study that compare crime in seattle and vancouver the non-gun rate be roughly the same for both city the difference in violent crime rate wa almost totally gun-related and a wa not point out in the study but in critique of it two seperate article by jame wright and david kopel come to mind it wa point out that the difference wa also almost entirely minority relate that be the gun crime rate skyrocket for poor minority black and hispanic primarily while when you compare the white majority they be virutally identical the problem with the nejm study wa they compare minority v non-minority percentage but fail to take into account the relative condition of those minority that there wa an eqaul percentage of nomn-white wa about a far a they go they fail to take into account that the non-white in either city be not live in the same condition if the situation wa entirely base on availability of gun then we expect that the white rate the two group which be arguably fairly comparative in the two city would have a far higher rate in seattle yet the majority in seattle be not only not significantly higher when the minority be exclude but slightly lower violent crime be highly concentrate in the inner city surprise pick the area with the highest incidence of poverty drug use disease etc since rate be lower in suburbium u middle clas folk can ignore the problem the point be of course that many of the inner-city problem be not mirror in canada a such if there be a condition which be significantly different in canada from the and violent crime be highly correlate to that area suggest that gun control be the source of canada low rate be highly questionable a one canadian point out on canada major gun control in do not result in either a reduction or a slow of an increase in violent crime rate which have be rise steadily since apparently they do even mirror the very large drop of violent crime in the early eighty most violent crime occur in area with strict gun control already post hoc ergo propter hoc those area implement gun control because of the high rate true only to a certain extent take washington where gun control wa institute while it have crime problem true but that crime proceed to explode afterward similarly for new york the question be not simply a point in time where crime wa high or low did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime since it go up in those area often faster than it wa go up before you ca simply dismis the high crime rate by say gun control wa cause by it ye gun control may be institute to deal with high crime but if the crime be not positively impact you ca continually say that that crime rate wa entirely a cause of that gun control since much of that crime rate increase after gun control wa implement just a happen in canada similar or worse rate exist in city with poor gun control a would be expect if violent crime wa generally independent of gun control and the jury be still out on the question of whether recent tough law in washington may have alleviate violence and suicide rate there would thi be the law which make manufacturer liable for what other do with their gun and suddenly the polouse find nobody would sell to them david veal univ of tenn div of cont education info service group i still remember the way you laugh the
