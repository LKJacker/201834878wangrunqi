stephanopoulo absolutely not q can you tell u more about the dole talk you say it wa a good visit but no compromise mr stephanopoulo ye the president have a good talk with senator dole last night i think that a we say before there be no specific compromise on either side although it wa a very good discussion about the job package and about other issue a well a you know the president first call senator dole i believe tuesday night to talk about the russian aid package they do not speak senator dole call him back wednesday morning when the president wa out instead he speak with tony lake and at the close of that conversation indicate that he want to speak to the president about the job and stimulu package they finally talk about that yesterday afternoon at the close of that discussion they say that they would have another talk last night which they do when the senator wa up in new hampshire and although there be no specific compromise make on either side they do say that they would continue to have some discussion and that where we be q well who be give in where be it stand be both make concession mr stephanopoulo i do know that it at that phase no compromise ha be make a the president ha say consistently he intend to come forward with an adjust package he believe in the package but he believe that if it go to take adjustment to get the minority to release it he will to make those adjustment q on the subject of a vat mr stephanopoulo oh boy q can we stay on thi for one more minute mr stephanopoulo sure q we have a problem with the five minute q i know no decision have be make but what would lead the health group to believe that a vat might be necessary mr stephanopoulo sorry andrea i not go to go down that road no decision have be make a the president say thi morning a number of group a number of member of congres a number of other organization have recommend that thi be look at the work group be look at it but no decision have be make q to follow have they do that directly through him have labor and busines group be in touch with the president about it mr stephanopoulo not to my knowledge although there a lot of person who have public decision in support of the vat but the president ha not make a decision q at the meet that he have with hi own task force adviser have they discuss the fund issue and what the possible option would be mr stephanopoulo i do think that that ha be present for a decision no q not for a decision but ha it be discuss a an option mr stephanopoulo again there be a lot of level of brief i do not believe that the vat ha be present to the president a okay thi be something for you to decide on q you not say he do know it wa be consider though be you mr stephanopoulo no he say it be consider q he know that q but ha he discuss that with hi adviser that what i ask mr stephanopoulo the president ha say it be consider i do not know what level of discussion there ha be over the vat it be something the work group be look at i do even know that it q but he do say he wa consider do he at thi stage mr stephanopoulo no he be not i think we get into something of a metaphysical debate right here what be consider q well he be the one who say i have review it mr stephanopoulo that be true that be what i just repeat q george be there any concern here that a a result of the definite statement he make in february and the promise that if it be to be consider he let u know and have it trickle out the way it do that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on thi issue and other mr stephanopoulo i do think so i mean it be now public knowledge that thi be be consider q is he or you at all embarrass about the absolute statement that be make from thi platform to the effect that it wa off the table and wa not be consider and then to have it come out not from you person but mr stephanopoulo well wait a second it come out from the administration what be you talk about q what i say be though that the president say he would let u know mr stephanopoulo right q you person then say you say i believe that it not go to be on the program mr stephanopoulo on march q on march mr stephanopoulo circumstance change q well i understand but we have to find that out by root around in the fine print of an interview mr stephanopoulo rooting around i know you do do a very good job there to read the usa today article but thi be laughter the deputy director of the omb and the secretary of health and human service i mean that be common anytime you guy write a story that ha an unattributed quote from somebody in the clinton administration the headline be i look at it right here and ap story clinton want more money for spy q what about hi remark that if it be be consider he tell u about it mr stephanopoulo and the administration concern and he let you know q and do he mr stephanopoulo ye absolutely what do he say thi morning q it have to be drag out of you here yesterday mr stephanopoulo it do have to be drag out of me we have the deputy director of the omb we have the secretary of health of human service say it wa be consider that be hi administration that be hi administration policy q were these authorize trial balloon or be they orchestrate leak i mean what wa the mr stephanopoulo they be ask question they answer the question q you say here that it do have to be drag out that you more or le make it clear yesterday you be consider it mr stephanopoulo absolutely i wa very clear painfully clear q wa there a particular political strategy in make it clear the administration be consider a new tax increase on tax day mr stephanopoulo no it wa just thi issue be be consider they be ask if it wa be consider they answer that it wa be consider q george the new york time q why do it yesterday mr stephanopoulo they be ask q the new york time report today that secretary reich and the chief economist at the labor department use apple and orange number in order to portray last month unemployment figure in a way that wa supportive of the president job stimulu bill but which turn out to be totally false mr stephanopoulo i do know if it wa totally false but i think laughter the chief economist at the labor department do grant that it wa an inappropriate mix and they say that q the question be be the president concern about behavior that amount to corrupt government datum and what he do about it if so mr stephanopoulo the chief economist ha say that a mistake wa make it wo happen again and that the end of the matter q is that the same information that go to the president q if i could go back to the stimulu package mr stephanopoulo there two separate piece of information i think that where the confusion wa q when do you all first learn about thi mistake that wa make mr stephanopoulo i read the article thi morning q and a far a you know be the president aware of it mr stephanopoulo i think so q and wa he aware of it before he read about it in the new york time mr stephanopoulo i do know not to my knowledge q did you ever hear about it before thi morning anything mr stephanopoulo i do q wa the president give an erroneou spin on thi for hi own purpose for hi speech for hi argument mr stephanopoulo well again i not sure both statement be true what the labor department ha grant be that mix them in one sentence essentially wa mislead they say it wa a mistake they say they would do it again q did they drop it be thi something that you choose to spin or make an issue of mr stephanopoulo whenever fewer person be out of work we gratify but that do take away from the need to get thi job package go q if i could go back to the stimulu package for a minute you say that the president plan to come forward with an amendment is the timetable still what it wa that the amendment would be lay down on monday and vote on on tuesday or do he in the conversation with dole talk about the possibility of put that off for a few more day to give more time for the discussion mr stephanopoulo i think at thi point there no change in the schedule at all i do know that they discuss the time like that q do you believe that you closer or get closer thi week than you be last week mr stephanopoulo again i believe that we go to pa a job package the president be prepare to make adjustment in order to get that to happen i do know where the vote be on cloture at thi particular time i do know what go to happen until we have a vote but the president believe deeply in thi job package and want to get it do q ha there be any indication that thi situation ha change mr stephanopoulo we go to continue to work on it we know when the vote be take q george last week you say that there be or variou person in the administration be say that you could go through dole you be go to have to try and go around him because he wa immovable on thi subject of a compromise or at least the compromise he want wa not anything like the one that you could accept thi week you talk to him is that because you realize that the peel off effort wa go to work mr stephanopoulo that because senator dole want to talk to the president about the stimulu package q he initiate the conversation mr stephanopoulo ye q secretary reich thi morning say that in fact the president be not will to compromise on thi bill at all you say he make mr stephanopoulo i do know that that exactly what he say i think he say he do have any indication that there wa any compromise yet or that there would be a compromise and the president do want to compromise and the president do want to compromise but if he ha to make adjustment to get it through he will q official here yesterday say that panettum wa work on a series of adjustment that might be make public before the actual vote mr stephanopoulo it possible q today mr stephanopoulo i not sure exactly when that will happen but i think that it very possible that we come forward with some sort of a different package or senate democrat will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it pass q a we understand hi conversation with dole the first one wa some discussion of thi and i get back to you tonight with some detail or some adjustment or whatever the phrase be did he offer him some detail or some adjustment mr stephanopoulo i think it a question of how detail i mean i think they have a general discussion about the package last night subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon i believe that there will be follow-up discussion today in the senate not necessarily between the president and senator dole and let me just reiterate neither side ha make specific compromise at thi date when we have something we let you know and i not suggest that senator dole ha accept anything that we talk about or that we offer anything in a hard way q what be the follow-up discussion if not the president and dole mr stephanopoulo i think senator mitchell be go to talk to senator dole q is that a threat laughter q did the president say to senator dole all right how about thi number a an overall size or do dole say to the president i can go a high a thi did they talk number mr stephanopoulo i do think it wa a negotiation in that respect it wa more of a discussion about their position q did they discus actual number mr stephanopoulo i just not sure i know they talk about the basic outline of the package i think they talk about the program they care about i do know if they get to the level of thi many x-billion dollar q do dole have to sign off before there be a package mr stephanopoulo no of course not q did the white house have anything to do with the protester who show up in new hampshire today where senator dole wa speak wa that in any way organize by mr stephanopoulo not to my knowledge no q and ha the president be in touch with senator kohl or feingold mr stephanopoulo i do think he talk to them no q george be the president consider the more palatable fact of have a national sale tax instead of have the have have to continuously pay for the have-not and be he go to scrap hi propose tax on the privilege few with the have have to pay for the have-not mr stephanopoulo the president believe deeply that the tax rate on upper income american a he present in hi budget should go up and i think for the second half of ymy question i refer you to my brief from yesterday q george on the subject of accuracy in information you suggest the other day that the stimulu package include money that would solve the water problem in milwaukee apparently that be not true it actually waste water money mr stephanopoulo it waste water money for wisconsin and some could go to milwaukee q but it would not affect the drink water problem because it waste water money right mr stephanopoulo it would affect the water treatment overall q but the implication from ymy statement the other day wa that it would help fix thi disease problem in milwaukee now would you agree that not the case mr stephanopoulo i not sure of the specific i know that it go to the overall water treatment in wisconsin q a leftover question from thi morning which wa when do the president find out that the task force wa deliberate on a vat mr stephanopoulo i not sure exactly when i just do know i assume it come up over the last certainly between the time that we have comment on in the past and two day ago q so sometime since march mr stephanopoulo i think that right i do know the exact date q george the president thi morning mention that some labor and busines group be for the vat tax apparently the national association of manufacturer talk about perhap the vat tax be okay if it replace the btu tax so do the president feel that perhap thi might be in place of some other tax he propose or be thi totally in addition to the other taxe he already propose mr stephanopoulo i think we say all we have to say about the vat at thi point i mean there just no thi be be consider by the health care work group and that be all the president ha make any further decision beyond that q but it would be to finance health care it would be to replace some other tax that finance it would replace the income tax for instance mr stephanopoulo there have be no discussion on that q in term of get a vat tax through congres senator dole pres release today say vat on tax day do you think do it have a chance of get through congres would it have a chance mr stephanopoulo i have no idea q is that a consideration whether you all put it forward mr stephanopoulo that would become a consideration if the president be to decide to do it it not in consideration now q you say at the begin of the brief that circumstance have change and that have cause the vat to now be under consideration mr stephanopoulo ye what the president refer to thi morning these group come forward and say thi be something that ha to be consider q those be the circumstance that have change that the only difference between now and when he emphatically rule it out that group have ask it to be consider mr stephanopoulo that what he say q is that true mr stephanopoulo ye q wa there in fact some understand that sin taxe would not produce enough money for the health care benefit mr stephanopoulo i not go to get into the deliberation q but george mr stephanopoulo no what the consideration be a the president say group come forward and say thi be something you ought to consider the work group be look at it q is that the only thing that change since hi prior statement and ymy prior statement on the vat mr stephanopoulo ye q can you explain how those group how that information get to him that group want it wa it just read the newspaper or do group make presentation mr stephanopoulo i think the group a you know the health care task force ha meet with dozen of group q but thi be the president knowledge that these group have come forward mr stephanopoulo i think he wa refer to what wa come to the work group obviously there have also be publish position in the newspaper q have certain group brief him on the group presentation to them mr stephanopoulo i do know if they brief him i mean how detail the brief have be i know that the work group decide to look into thi after be press by these group q what kind of argument do the group make that be persuasive enough that the president would change the position that he have enunciate previously mr stephanopoulo i do know it just they have longstanding position that thi would be a good way to finance health care q the president wa aware of those longstanding position mr stephanopoulo he may have be at some level obviously he be a governor for a long time and he know the basic argument for and against a vat tax q what we try to figure out here you tell u that the only change the only thing that affect thi change in the president attitude toward the vat between february and now mr stephanopoulo the president attitude ha necessarily change i mean he ha not make a decision q i know but the president say that it wa off the table so do you and you say that the only thing that change be the position of these group except you also describe them a longstanding position i do see the change if these group have have any change in their position that be make to the president mr stephanopoulo well they make the presentation to the health care task force q there no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxe that he have say suggest in february that he favor will not produce enough revenue to finance mr stephanopoulo i do think he ever suggest that they would produce all the revenue q well he suggest that he think that those be appropriate way to finance health care mr stephanopoulo he do say that i do know that he say anything to refute that q but in fact ha the task force discover that there would be enough revenue from those taxe to finance the kind of core benefit mr stephanopoulo again i do think that the task force ever suggest that there would q george if he advocate a vat tax would that break hi promise not to raise taxe on the middle clas to pay for hi program mr stephanopoulo i ca comment on a hypothetical situation q but do that promise would that promise not to raise taxe on the middle clas to pay for the program prevent him from seek a vat tax mr stephanopoulo the president ha make no decision on the vat tax when he do we tell you and we explain the implication then q which specific group can you cite busines labor or otherwise whose recommendation to the health care task force ha prompt thi consideration mr stephanopoulo i do have the specific i just do have that q george can you tell u to what extend these other alternative for instance the employer tax or the sin taxe or other finance option be also still on the table and what these option be mr stephanopoulo no a member of the task force and representative of the work group have say they be look at a wide variety of option i think that ira magaziner say that there be different option under consideration but i not go to comment q what the scope mr stephanopoulo i just not go to comment on them no q what the scope of the need how much be you talk about that ha to be produce by one or a combination of the mr stephanopoulo that what the health care task force be look at q since there not go to be any brief on the miyazawa visit two question one generally what do the president hope to use that meet for but more specifically be hi task complicate by the japanese anger over the vancouver note and the remark about market acces at the pres conference mr stephanopoulo the vancouver note q do no mean ye q ye and no mr stephanopoulo well i do know i saw the prime minister pres conference where he wa ask the question about that note and he give a very graciou and complete answer when he wa ask the question the question of trade be something that certainly will be discuss between the prime minister and the president there be obviously a trade imbalance between japan and the that we want to do something about q also in those comment the prime minister make he suggest that the united state should come down heavy on him in term of trade are you go to oblige mr stephanopoulo i think the president will state my view on trade very clearly and my view on the trade deficit very clearly i do necessarily want to agree with ymy characterization of the prime minister comment q that we need specific export target specific numerical target be that what he go to discus with miyazawa mr stephanopoulo they go to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issue i do want to get into those specific until after the meet q why q that the crux of the issue right whether or not do the president believe that without specific numerical target it be really a he say in hi pres conference sort of hopeles that thi be go to change very much mr stephanopoulo the president believe that we must have pressure on japan to turn the trade imbalance around i do not want to get into the specific of how that would be do q but do the president believe that their stimulu package announce yesterday will rectify the imbalance mr stephanopoulo i think first the president want to get a full brief on the stimulu package from prime minister miyazawa himself and then he make the comment on it q how about the russian aid package there seem to be some confusion about how the view that secretary christopher say or bentsen say the japanese may need to do more the japanese say that that not what they hear mr stephanopoulo again we go to continue to work with all my ally in the and we go to continue to pres for help for russian reform russian democratic reform and i think that so far we have a very good announcement out of tokyo and we go to continue to work with my ally for bilateral package q do you think the japanese need to do more mr stephanopoulo we go to continue to work with all my ally to do a much a we can q secretary christopher wa ask today on the today show thi morning what he think of margaret thatcher comment on the bosnium policy and he say it a rather emotional response mr stephanopoulo over an emotional issue q right to an emotional problem do the white house condone that kind of remark mr stephanopoulo i think that secretary christopher remark speak for itself the president believe also that thi be a deeply trouble situation that we try to find answer for q but that specific rather emotional response specific term mr stephanopoulo no it speak for itself q in connection with that do it seem that with the number of person who be be kill at thi very moment be it good american policy to put off some decision that might be make now to help bori yeltsin win a referendum mr stephanopoulo for example q to take stronger action to take military action air strike anything that can be do mr stephanopoulo the president believe that what must be do now be to push harder for sanction he be also a you know the administration ha be discuss lift the arm embargo he believe those be the appropriate way to increase pressure at thi time q what be ymy response to the critic who would say that the be now stymie by try to help bori yeltsin retain the presidency mr stephanopoulo they wrong we press hard for the serb to come to the negotiate table we press hard for increase sanction and we talk to my ally about the arm embargo q you be put great store in vance and owen get person to agree to that now vance and owen have both say that military force to some extent would be acceptable do that change ymy think mr stephanopoulo clearly we go to listen to whatever person who have put so much time into a situation have to say but at thi point the president be move forward on sanction and talk about the arm embargo q a follow-up on a dee dee comment thi morning she say she would be able to provide some administration official who could document the effect the sanction be have in bosnium are you go to be able to do that or do you have anything mr stephanopoulo i do think that what she say q that exactly what she say mr stephanopoulo i do think that true but what she say we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provide in bosnium obviously if there be connection between the bosnian serb and the serb in belgrade and we be tighten the screw on the serb in belgrade that will have an effect over time i do not know day by day minute by minute what kind of help be be give between the two and what the exact effect ha be but clearly we be slow the shipment of good into belgrade we be have an effect on the serb there what kind of effect that will eventually have on the bosnian serb i do know but one thing i would say be if it be have no effect at all i do know why they be fight it so much q are the first lady tax return go to be release mr stephanopoulo i think there a joint tax return and it will be probably later today q is the president consider sign an executive order ban discrimination against homosexual in the federal work force a part of the gay right march here next week mr stephanopoulo i do think there any proposal for that at thi time not that i know of q it something that the president promise during the campaign that he would do mr stephanopoulo i have not see any i do think it anything that on hi plate right now q is he meet with gay right leader at any point on thi issue mr stephanopoulo i do know about on thi issue i assume that he meet with representative of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon a he meet with representative of lot of different group and community q do you know if that schedule mr stephanopoulo it probably go to be tomorrow q probably go to be tomorrow laughter q it a good thing you ask q who probably go to be there laughter mr stephanopoulo i do know q how long mr stephanopoulo i do know that all i know q do you know if it at tomorrow laughter mr stephanopoulo i do know what time it be i do even know for sure if it go to be tomorrow q environmental group have ask him to make a major speech next week of some kind is that go to happen do you know mr stephanopoulo i do know if they ask but i think the president ha alway plan a he do last year to give a speech on earth day and i expect that he will if it not exactly on earth day it might be a day before or something like that q is he plan to sign or announce the sign of the biodiversity treaty in connection with earth day mr stephanopoulo again i do know the specific time of something like that but it certainly something under discussion and something we be work on q campaign finance reform mr stephanopoulo we work on it q do you think it will be next week mr stephanopoulo i just not sure q the biodiversity treaty be something you work on i miss the question mr stephanopoulo ye something we work on he ask if it wa ready to be sign and i say i do know anything about that but it something we certainly be work on q do you know what organization might be represent in thi meet with the gay and lesbian group mr stephanopoulo i do q do you know if he be go to reconsider be out of town on the day of the march mr stephanopoulo he get to be at the senate meet in jamestown and i believe he also go to be give a speech to the american association of newspaper publisher in boston on sunday a he do last year q would you have tell u if she have not press you on the question mr stephanopoulo on what q on the gay mr stephanopoulo when we go through the president schedule for the day certainly q george what day be the publisher speech is that sunday mr stephanopoulo i think it a sunday q and saturday he be in jamestown mr stephanopoulo ye q so you just go to be in jamestown for one day mr stephanopoulo no i not sure i do know how long the senate thing go it might go overnight i just do know q you would have make the gay meet public right mr stephanopoulo i certain if we have the meet i do know about open to the pres but we would have tell you about it q i mean because it be a far a i can tell the first time in history a president ha meet in the oval office with mr stephanopoulo i do say it wa go to be in the oval office laughter but i do i not say that it not but i do say that it wa laughter q at the white house in the bush administration gay official be invite to a bill sign ceremony and the white house have to repudiate have do that so i just want to make sure mr stephanopoulo well the president would do anything like that q certainly not q what march order do the president give to general vessey mr stephanopoulo they have a very good discussion for about half an hmy today he want the most important thing wa he have a full account for american pow and mia he will obviously look into the circumstance surround thi new document the president stress that he want the fullest possible account and say that only when we have that can we even consider any change in my policy toward vietnam he be look at vietnam response to the question raise by the document and he also look into investigation on discrepancy case increase effort on remain implement trilateral investigation and acces to military archive and ambassador toon also brief the president on the activity of the joint commission and on the document q vietnam say it a fake what be the dod analysi at thi stage mr stephanopoulo it not complete yet and it also the first thing that general vessey will bring up with the vietnamese q a number of defense official have be say that they think that the or so prisoner refer to be in fact non-american that the vietnamese have capture who they refer to a american from time to time do person mr stephanopoulo we do have any final determination we go to wait for the complete review when we have it we make a judgment q i know you do have any final determination but give all of the intense public interest in thi do you think that that a likely possibility mr stephanopoulo i just do want to characterize it in any way until the review be complete q george wa there a topic schedule for the speech in boston mr stephanopoulo no q is the president go to have a pres conference tomorrow with miyazawa mr stephanopoulo i think so but i not positive ye i expect ye q wa toon in with vessey mr stephanopoulo ye q he wa in on the meet mr stephanopoulo ye q what wa the question mr stephanopoulo wa ambassador toon in with vessey and the answer be ye q do you have any response to the wall street journal report thi morning the president distress about some of hi pres clip and that perhap he distress with you about that mr stephanopoulo no well i do have a response i think the article wa highly mislead to the extent that it imply that the president ha have restrict acces to the pres i would point out that he answer question on occasion more than any of hi predecessor i would also point out it also q how many question mr stephanopoulo three hundred fifty-eight on occasion q how many be while he wa jog mr stephanopoulo well no that actually a very good question andrea and i would point out further that the article also imply that these question be only answer at tightly control photo opportunity which be just patently false he have pres conference in either the east room the oval office or the roosevelt room or the briefing room in addition to question take at photo opportunity and that be only the q oval office pres conference when wa that mr stephanopoulo he answer question in the east room he have five in the east room he have one in the oval office he have one in the rose garden he have one or two in the roosevelt room and thi be just to the white house washington pres corps in addition to that he have interview with local television anchor he meet with the editorial board of the portland oregonian he have an hour-long interview with dan rather he have interview with local pres from californium florida and connecticut q can you addres the question of the attitude the article imply that he do q why do he like u laughter q did you really get blame for that post story q the story be that you be you hold responsible for it mr stephanopoulo i do think i go to comment about thi q are you deny that the president ha show displeasure publicly mr stephanopoulo i be not comment on the discussion between the president and myself q did the president write that letter to chri webber mr stephanopoulo what q the letter to the university of michigan basketball player mr stephanopoulo oh ye q that be an authentic letter mr stephanopoulo ye q since the president first talk about the vat in february he say at the time that he think there probably should be exception make in basic necessity such a food and clothe do he still hold that position give the impact it could have mr stephanopoulo again i just ca comment on a proposal he ha make q george do the president have some agenda for thi meet with the gay leader tomorrow mr stephanopoulo well i think it will just a general meet on the wide range of issue that they care about include aid and other issue civil right q the military issue mr stephanopoulo i certain it will come up q is he use thi event to name the aid mr stephanopoulo i do think so q george what specifically be the president do to prepare for tomorrow meet with the prime minister miyazawa mr stephanopoulo he have brief memo he have general discussion with member of the treasury department the trade representative and other q report yet mr stephanopoulo i do know if he ha the report refer to in the time but ambassador kantor wa here to brief him today q he wa mr stephanopoulo ye q do he intend to use any of these instance that mr stephanopoulo again i do know that the report be present but obviously the president will pres hard in any case where he think that a violation ha occur q in term of the wall street journal the thrust wa that there a real schism here a hostility do you think he feel that way mr stephanopoulo not at all a i say on the record in the article i think the president like reporter again i think that the thrust of the article wa still mislead the thrust of the article wa that in some way some attitude which the president may or may not have be affect acces when in fact he ha the most open accessible administration than have any in recent history q can we come up to ymy office laughter mr stephanopoulo if you invite the pres thank you end edt
