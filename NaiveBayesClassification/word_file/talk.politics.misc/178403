from gld gary l dare subject re eight myth about national health insurance pt ius harelb co-moderator write f o eight myth about national health insurance pt ius an office visit that in seattle be in vancouver canada that because among other thing they give their government power to bargain with doctor and hospital over fee the difference in the litigation environment be reflect in the fee lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice be really why we spend le use the most expensive approach of pure insurance in canada along with france and germany without hmo the nyt ha admit that malpractice insurance fee be an order of magnitude lower in canada but doctor take-home pay be almost equal to american doctor also minimal bureaucracy the system be so-o-o simple early march part of the deal for use the all-insurance approach like the french and german do hey why do they criticize france and germany is it because too many person take french and german in college to make the accusation stick wa to preserve the doctor independance since the provincial wing of the cma be the one that go to bat when the fee schedule hike be present the politically-bent doctor be just cackle when they realize the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialize medicine approach like britain national health service you get to remember you get a wait list a well but it not a obviou if you poor and you do have insurance you do go to a surgeon in the state you ration by ability to pay for non-life threaten thing market argument adequately cover why certain procedure be in scarcer demand i have md friend who ca make a live a specialist back in manitoba not due to the insurance rate but because they wo get enough customer the cma medical monopoly grip on doctor licence a in the u aside so they must move to larger place however thi do not refute debunk of wait line for urgent and routine care a ha be do in the by consumer report health policy study cite by prof denni e shea on usenet cnn nyt etc doug fierro ha post a nyt article from week ago about canada health insurance approach on there be one small error in the article not all of my hospital be private would national health insurance mean that american who are now fully insured might have to settle for les in canada provincial insurance cover all health cost except dental care eyeglass prescription drug ambulance service and private hospital room so many canadian do end up buy some private insurance a policy to cover all of these thing run about to a month of course the one thing to note be that in the case private insurance offload the basic coverage to the public sector they realize they be keep extra insurance for thing like room v ward accomodation dental glass etc for corporate or personal benefit they have nothing to do with you if you want to be cover for basic care at that point they would even consider a voucher approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policy to make up the difference in the federal guideline and market stuff would free care encourage person to run to the doctor for every ache and pain person who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical bill still canadian who pay nothing at the doctor have a lower per-person health bill than we do it be free in that there be no deductible nor copayment two thing which i advocate to make the canadian insurance look more like real health insurance which actually it be i know that when work in albertum ontario and quebec i wa aware that i wa pay for health insurance in toronto ohip fee be list on my pay stub manitoba do not collect at paycheque time but only annually at income tax time build into the tax rate only fiscal naif will proclaim that it free along with the canadian left for that be part of their brainwash agenda the french do have copayment though france magazine summer edition ha a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage include a sample chart of copayment percentage for day you cover for of the public hospital rate afterward with extra private insurance you can get into a private hospital and be cover for any difference beyond the public hospital rate the public insurance cover beyond day or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference be pay out-of-pocket or accord to ymy supplementary private insurance over of french have some form of extra private insurance so the other of health cost in europe be out of private fund not glean from other taxe the gdp figure be combine public and private expenditure for total outlay use the same method that yield the figure for the is the private health insurance industry just too big and powerful to kill dismantling the health segment of my insurance industry would be politically thorny in the quiet word of one advocate for a national plan some firm now sell more than billion in health insurance they put up a hard fight not only ha the industry grow eightfold since canada shut down it own health insurer but my government leaf politician more open to lobbyist than do canada parliamentary system health insurance do exist in canada and in western europe it just that it do cover basic care you can opt out in canada and germany but you have to go uninsured a a result because there be too few other person that do so no market when private insurance realize how much money they make without the risk involve in basic insurance neurosurgery versu deluxe amenity
