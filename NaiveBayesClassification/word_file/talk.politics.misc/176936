a register trademark of audio book inc a texa corporation which originally produce thi tape record reproduced under open license grant by audio book inc thi be the dr beter audio letter r k st nw washington dc hello my friend thi be dr beter today be april and thi be my audio letter r no it now be almost one month since war break out in the south atlantic on the surface it seem that it only a dispute between argentina and great britain over the barren wind-swept falkland island and south georgia island in reality it far more than that the so-called falkland crisi be just the visible tip of a giant military operation during thi month of april fierce naval battle have take place not only in the south atlantic but also in the south pacific up to now most of the hostility have be keep under wrap by wartime censorship on all side but a i say these word the naval war in the southern hemisphere be about to come to the surface beginning today april a total naval and air blockade of the falkland by the royal navy ha begin at the same time a counterblockade ha be declare by argentina in the same area to be effective a blockade must be impose over a period of time but the royal navy do not have that much time winter be come on in the south atlantic and the british supply line be overextend having come thi far her majesty navy can not simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few week time without draw blood from argentina a a result the british will be force to undertake military operation very soon no matter how risky they may be there be also another reason why the royal navy now ha no choice but to engage the argentine force in combat that reason my friend be that the royal navy ha already suffer loss in secret combat thi month up to thi moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which ha be sustain by the british fleet only when publicly admit fight erupt will the british dare to admit that they have suffer battle loss to obtain that cover story the british have no choice but to sail into combat but in do so they will be risk even heavier loss on top of those already sustain in short my friend her majesty navy ha sail into a trap the event now unfold in the south atlantic carry strange ironic echo of the past for week now we be hear countles commentator refer to the british task force a an armada quote the british of all person ought to be very uneasy with that description the original spanish armada year ago wa renowned a a seemingly invincible fight force but it come to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it change the course of history and it wa none other than the english navy that destroy the spanish armada the original spanish armada put to sea in during the reign of england queen elizabeth i the armada wa an invasion fleet carry thousand of crack fight man to invade england they be meet by the dare sea dog of sir franci drake drake and hi small fast ship turn the table on the spanish armada by change the rule of battle the english fleet wa equip with new longer-range gun and it stay upwind and out of reach from there the english pound smash and shatter the big ship of the mighty armada when it wa all over barely half the spanish fleet wa leave to limp back to port drake defeat of the spanish armada wa a shock to the world it open the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start it expansion into a truly global empire today year later history seem to have come full circle queen elizabeth ius be witness the dismantle of the world empire whose heyday begin under queen elizabeth i and now the culture of england and of spain be once again in confrontation once again a so-called armada be prepare for invasion but thi time the armada be british not spanish fmy hundred year ago sir franci drake wa the hero of the day today the ghost of franci drake be once again on the scene the south atlantic war zone be at the eastern end of the drake passage around the southern tip of south america the defeat of the spanish armada fmy century ago break the back of spain naval supremacy and now the defeat of the new british armada may well break the back of what remain of the once gloriou royal navy my three special topic for thi audio letter be topic the military secret of south georgia island topic the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic the rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war topic when the falkland island crisi begin early thi month it look at first like a tempest in a teapot for a century and a half since the island have be control by great britain during that entire time british sovereignty over the falkland ha be dispute by argentina there have be countles threat by argentina to seize the island which it call the malvina but the threat have alway come to nothing in the past and britain ha never even get very worry about them the island be fmy time a distant from argentina a cuba be from the united state and they be not much of a prize after year of occupancy the falkland be home to fewer than british settler and a lot of sheep in short the remote falkland island hardly look like something to fight over and yet here we be watch another crisi take place we be watch a war erupt between great britain and argentina the thatcher government be act a if it ha forget all about it usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at nato doorstep instead britain be throw almost everything it get at argentina aircraft carrier cruiser destroyer submarine assault ship you name it luxury cruise ship have even be commission and turn into troop carrier overnight wave after wave of additional assault troop have be activate and send to join the fleet even after it sail ship and submarine have be pull off station from normal nato duty and send to reinforce the task force the initial force ha grow steadily over the past several week into an armada number over over two-third of the entire royal navy ha already be deploy to the south atlantic off argentina watching all thi a lot of person be ask what thi fight really all about the most popular answer suggest in the major medium be oil vast deposit of oil be know to exist under the continental shelf between argentina and the falkland but that ha be know for nearly year in no way do it explain the time of the sudden military offensive by argentina thi month and oil explain even le about the argentine seizure of south georgia island south georgia island be mile east of the falkland with no know oil deposit anywhere near it and compare to south georgia the falkland be an island paradise south georgia island be cover with rugged mountain treacherou valley glacier and semi-permanent snow most of it be uninhabitable on top of all that argentina ha absolutely no legal or historical claim to south georgia island in that respect it stand in sharp contrast to the falkland in the early the falkland be occupy for a while by argentine colonist in the british expel them and take over the island for that and other historical reason argentina argue that the falkland really belong to argentina not britain but no such argument be possible for south georgia island it ha alway be control by britain never by argentina or spain the argentine seizure of south georgia island look even more unreasonable from a military point of view argentina leader be military man and they think in military term they be well aware ahead of time that far-off south georgia island could not possibly be hold for long by seize it they be set themself up to absorb a military defeat a the island wa retake by britain so the question be why do argentina military juntum bother with the seemingly worthles south georgia island at all my friend the answer to all these question be military not political or economic south georgia island posse an enormou military secret it a giant underground installation bury under the mountain at the northwest end of the island the real reason for the so-called falkland crisi be thi secret installation together with two other similar installation which i will describe shortly the secret military complex have be in existence for many year they be not new what be new be the accelerate nuclear war timetable of the american bolshevik war planner here in washington for the past two month i be report the detail of thi new war plan to you a quickly a i can obtain and verify them the plan call for nuclear war one to erupt by september of thi year it be thi fast-approaching nuclear war threat that cause the so-called falkland crisi to erupt now what be go on now be a coordinate effort to spoil part of the bolshevik grand strategy for the come nuclear war the mutual enemy of the american bolshevik here namely the rockefeller cartel and russium new ruler in the kremlin be behind the present crisi they be try to ruin phase of the project z war plan which i reveal last month that phase be to be world domination by the american bolshevik after both russium and the united state have be destroy in nuclear war one a i mention last month the key to thi plan be the existence of secret weapon stockpile in variou place around the world the american bolshevik military planner here in america be work with other bolshevik agent in key military position of other country to set off war having do that they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have cause safe and cozy in government war bunker when the war nation finally lie smolder and exhaust the bolshevik will leave the shatter remain of their host country they will rendezvou at the secret weapon installation and bring their weapon into the open they will confront the world with the only remain fresh up-to-date powerful military force on earth and use that military power they will become the undisputed ruler of the world that be they plan to do all thi and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by set off nuclear war one in a matter of month the rockefeller cartel and russium new anti-bolshevik ruler be work together in a race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan last month i mention that the bolshevik here be benefit from war preparation which be start by the rockefeller long ago it ha only be about three year since the rockefeller be dislodge a the prime mover of the united state government by the bolshevik since that time the united state government ha be a house divide tear by internal power struggle between rival bolshevik and rockefeller faction but before that the united state have be dominate for decade both economically and politically by the fmy rockefeller brother in the brother launch a new long-range plan for world domination it wa a two-prong strategy half visible and half secret which i first describe long ago in audio letter no it wa a plan for the united state to arm to the tooth in secret while appear to disarm gradually without repeat all the detail the basic idea wa grandiose yet simple by deliberately appear weak the rockefeller-controlled united state would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russium then the secret weapon include superweapon would be unleash to smash russium and take over the world when they set the grand plan in motion in the rockefeller brother be look ahead to a nuclear war by the late their military analyst conclude very early that the war be plan would have very different effect on the northern and southern hemisphere both superpower the united state and the soviet union be locate well up in the northern hemisphere so be the other full-fledged nuclear power great britain france red china and indium by contrast the strategic target for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere be relatively few and far between in other word it wa expect that the come nuclear war would be essentially a northern hemisphere war in an all-out nuclear holocaust it be know that seriou radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even area not initially hit by war but there be limit to how far the war cloud can spread it wa discover long ago that there be very little mix between the air of the northern and southern hemisphere in the northern half of my planet cold air from the north pole work it way southward toward the equator then it work it way back to the north a warm air a mirror image of thi proces take up the southern half of the planet northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone but very little of the air change place the military conclusion my friend be thi the come nuclear war could ruin large area of the northern hemisphere for generation to come but if the calculation be right the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war thi wa music to the ear of the fmy rockefeller brother a quick look at the globe of the world show why the rockefeller cartel ha dominate latin america ever since world war ius a i discuss in my very first monthly audio letter nelson rockefeller solidify the cartel grip on latin america during the war he accomplish thi a so-called coordinator of hemispheric defense for then-president franklin d roosevelt so that take care of the south american continent and it natural resource then there be the african continent there too rockefeller control wa already in effect over wide area of black africa especially south of the equator all thi wa thank to the effort of john d rockefeller iius a i detail in audio letter no looking around the globe the most important remain land mass from the standpoint of world domination be australium and new zealand thank to world war ius both be wide open to the rockefeller the rockefeller brother decide to establish secret military installation in the southern hemisphere for use after the come war by thi mean they expect to become the master of the survive southern half of planet earth after the northern hemisphere war then a the northern hemisphere gradually recover from the nuclear holocaust the rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the piece in thi way the third generation rockefeller brother expect their family dynasty to inherit the earth in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after the war some mean would have to be available to project military power onto any land ma for example revolt against rockefeller domination would require troop not a blast from the beam weapon on the moon the most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world wa find to be a navy a minimum of two secret naval fleet would be require one base in the south atlantic the other in the south pacific since the reserve naval fleet be to be keep secret until after the northern hemisphere nuclear war they could not be build in exist shipyard new construction facility have to be build and they have to be hide to hide an entire shipyard be no small task they take up a lot of space on top of that it wa essential that the ship remain hide after they be build the best way to achieve that wa to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation finally the secret naval installation have to be invulnerable to nuclear attack otherwise if it existence be ever discover prematurely the secret navy might be wipe out the combine requirement for secrecy space and protection against attack be formidable but one day in while all these plan be still in the early stage of development the answer present itself during a so-called bank trip to sweden david rockefeller wa give a tmy of a unique hide naval port the port be hollow out from solid granite cliff which come right down to the water the entrance to the port be a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be seal off with enormou steel door inside thi big doorway on the water a huge cavity ha be hollow out to accommodate ship the rockefeller brother and their military adviser decide that a bigger more secret better protect version of the swedish hide port wa just what they want a survey of candidate site wa then initiate the site survey cover coastal area throughout the southern hemisphere many area be reject very quickly because the topography wa wrong other area be reject because they be too close to the equator still other have to be rule out because there be too many person live nearby make the desire level of secrecy impossible finally it wa essential that the site choose for the secret naval installation be totally secure politically at last the site for the secret naval installation be select in the south pacific extreme southern new zealand wa select thi be what i wa allude to in audio letter no three month ago when i call attention to new zealand extreme importance in the come war in order to obtain the necessary space the secret new zealand naval installation have to be divide up into two site locate close together one be at the extreme southwest tip of south island where the mountain range know a the southern alp come down virtually to the water edge the other part of the installation be build into the northwest tip of stewart island which be off the tip of south island the stewart island facility be hollow out within a rise know a mt anglem the new zealand location meet all the requirement ever since world war ius the government of new zealand ha be tie even closer to the united state than to great britain the location be far from the equator and the installation be bury deep under mountain protect from nuclear attack they be also too deep to be reach by particle-beam attack and the new zealand site be well situate to command the entire south pacific in the south atlantic an even more perfect site wa find that site my friend be south georgia island it be locate perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic the tall rugged mountain provide a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the long island it be control by great britain whose government like that of new zealand wa will to cooperate and south georgia island wa virtually uninhabited except for a whale station on the northeast coast the whale station wa some mile away from the secret new installation which wa be build but britain take no chance in the whale station wa close down since that time there have be no inhabitant on south georgia island except for a few dozen allege antarctic scientist construction of the secret naval facility two in new zealand one on south georgia island begin in the early the technique be adapt from those use previously to build other large underground facility such a the norad installation inside cheyenne mountain colorado however these technique be adapt in radically new way to achieve construction acces directly from the sea instead of overland in thi way the shelter mountain wa leave undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction the cut in the mountain side which be necessary to let ship in and out be keep a small a possible and be well camouflage like the swedish hide naval port arrangement the entrance to the secret installation can be seal up when seal the entrance be virtually impossible to detect unles you know exactly where it be and unlike most large construction project there be no tail or pile of leftover rock lie around to attract attention the man-made cavern which house the secret naval installation be enormou but all the rock and debris wa dispose of at sea once the secret naval facility be build they have to be outfit for ship construction and docksite storage the fake disarmament of the united state during the contribute greatly to thi task from to one man play a pivotal role in thi elaborate rockefeller scheme he wa then-secretary of defense robert mcnamara all through the mcnamara preside over the public par back of america visible military power thi include the close down and dismantle of entire shipyard what we be not tell wa where all that shipyard equipment go afterward where it go my friend wa to the new secret installation which be be outfit in new zealand and south georgia island the secret naval installation have be use a duplication facility to reproduce certain ship and submarine design and build here in the united state a defense secretary caspar weinberger tell congres recently it be cheaper to build two ship at a time that be especially true if the second ship be an exact duplicate of the first thi ha become even more true in recent year through the use of computerize manufacture technique the secret naval fleet which have be build at the secret installation be make up of duplicate exact duplicate of certain other ship and submarine they be all nuclear power nuclear sub nuclear cruiser nuclear destroyer and ye nuclear aircraft carrier three of them a secret twin wa build for the nimitz for the eisenhower and for the newly-launched carl vincent all have be finance through the gigantic cost overrun so call that we constantly hear about in the defense department and all three carrier have be provide with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture wa finance the same way the ship of the secret american bolshevik naval fleet be all duplicate of other nuclear-powered vessel even so the secret naval ship posse one key difference last month i reveal that the so-called stealth program ha succeed in develop a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield thi technique make an object invisible from a distance by distort light wave in it vicinity a whole new fleet of phantom war-plane be now go into crash production that use thi principle and my friend all of the secret american bolshevik navy ship have already be outfit with similar stealth-field equipment the stealth principle be actually easier to apply to ship than to airplane because there be more room for the powerful equipment that generate the field after nuclear war one the secret stealth navy of the american bolshevik would be light year ahead of any other navy leave on earth it would be perfect for the intend role of world domination the rockefeller set it all in motion long ago my friend but three year ago they lose control of the united state military now it the american bolshevik who be in control and they be bend on war these secret naval installation have precipitate what be be call the falkland crisi topic in audio letter r no last month i describe project z the new bolshevik three-phase strategy for nuclear war one an elite group of american bolshevik military planner here be flush out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in washington it a plan by which the united state will strike the first nuclear blow follow by all-out thermonuclear war with russium having set off the holocaust the bolshevik here and in certain other country plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunker finally after nuclear war one fizzle out in stalemate they plan to leave behind the ash of the united state and her ally activating phase of their grand strategy they plan to unveil their secret weapon especially their secret naval fleet with these they plan to conquer and rule what be leave of the world the united state a we know it will be dead and go but in the eye of the bolshevik themself thi outcome will constitute victory up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first reveal two month ago be still on track they be still shoot for nuclear war to begin by september of thi year time be fast run out the bolshevik here be sprint a fast a they can toward war but my friend the bolshevik be not the only runner in thi race they have two deadly enemy both of whom be equally determine to trip up the bolshevik one enemy of the bolshevik here be the rockefeller cartel the other enemy be the new anti-bolshevik rule clique in russium and now these two mutual enemy of the bolshevik be pool their effort in certain way in audio letter no three month ago i report that a limit new anti-bolshevik coalition wa in the work between the rockefeller cartel and the russian the january meet between haig and gromyko in geneva switzerland wa a turn point in the formation of thi coalition it be now a reality and be responsible for the so-called falkland crisi now dominate the headline it should be emphasize that thi new relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russium fall far short of a true alliance they have very major dispute to be settle between them but for the time be they have call a truce between themself to deal with their mutual deadly enemy the bolshevik here in america the first priority of the russian and the rockefeller be to slow down the bolshevik preparation for imminent nuclear war if they can do that time be on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movement which i discuss last summer in audio letter no a slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathe space for additional anti-bolshevik action to be implement the joint rockefeller-russian planner decide by mid-february that military action against the bolshevik wa essential very quickly no other type of action have any hope of take effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of thi summer the exact detail of the project z war plan be not know to either the rockefeller or the russian but the general outline be know to be a i describe last month it wa decide that military action should be devise that would undermine phase of the bolshevik war plan that be the bolshevik-controlled secret naval installation and fleet in the southern hemisphere should be attack and cripple by work together the rockefeller cartel and the russian be able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carry out alone the rockefeller group who build and originally control these basis provide detail intelligence about the best way to attack them the russian with their enormou military machine provide the muscle to actually carry out the attack it wa essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleet in the south atlantic and south pacific to be attack survival intact of either fleet would leave the bolshevik war plan still workable military analyst conclude very quickly that a direct assault on the new zealand facility wa out of the question there wa no combination of commando frogman or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world any attack on the new zealand basis would set off the very war which the rockefeller and russian want to prevent but the situation in the south atlantic wa a different matter in a way the greatest asset of south georgia island wa also it achille heel the extreme isolation which protect the secrecy of the south georgia base also make a covert military assault feasible the key lay with argentina and her long-standing claim to the falkland island a i mention in topic the rockefeller cartel ha dominate all of latin america for decade cartel operative be send to argentina to work out a deal with the government military juntum there the historic dispute over the falkland island wa to be use to provide a ruse a military cover to enable the south georgia base to be attack the argentine general be not tell everything about the situation by any mean but they be tell enough to make clear what they be to do a an inducement to cooperate the argentine leader be promise handsome reward they be guarantee that after the shoot wa over the falkland island would remain in argentine hand thi guarantee include the promise of covert military assistance a need against the royal navy and to bolster the trouble argentine economy it wa promise that the rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserve with these combine promise of military glory and financial reward the argentine military juntum agree to the plan on march argentina carry out act in the joint attack plan a group of argentine scrap-metal merchant of all thing land at the abandon old whale station on south georgia island supposedly they be there to dismantle the old build and cart them off to sell while they be at it they also raise the argentine flag over the work-site the british alway nervou about south georgia island promptly react a expect the british antarctic survey ship endurance put marine ashore they drive off the scrap merchant and tear down the argentine flag the incident provide the desire excuse for the argentine juntum to bring the simmer falkland dispute to a boil from time to time in the past argentina ha claim that south georgia be part of the falkland because it be administer that way by britain that argument be very flimsy but it now come in very handy it wa nothing new to hear thi from argentine leader so there wa no hint of what wa really afoot during late march argentine military force start assemble for an assault on the falkland nothing new think the british high command argentina ha carry out threaten maneuver in the past many time it wa believe that they be about to do it again but on april argentine force do the unexpected after many past false alarm thi time they actually invade and seize the island all argentine public statement emphasize the long-standing historical claim to the falkland themself but just for good measure the next day a small argentine force also seize far-off south georgia island the force wa so small that it give the appearance initially that it wa just a side show from argentina point of view however the small contingent of royal marine be overpower and bundle off the island along with a group of allege scientist that wa the moment of payoff in the joint rockefeller-russian attack plan thank to the elaborate distraction stag by the argentine force a special commando team get onto the island undetected based on the detail rockefeller information about the base the team move to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernou secret base special high-speed drill equipment wa set up by the rockefeller member of the team while the russian member concentrate on military defense by late that even april the military high command in london finally learn what wa really take place the secret south georgia base wa under attack by virtually the only mean possible the joint rockefeller-russian team be drill a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollow out cavern inside it wa only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hide naval base once the hole wa make the next step wa obviou the rockefeller-russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole the best gues wa that it would be a nerve ga the shock wave that go through the highest level of the british government on the even of april can hardly be describe my friend the thatcher government like the so-called reagan administration here in america be bolshevik control that why margaret thatcher alway say me too any time the reagan administration say or do anything against russium both government be party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the person of their respective country and on the even of april they suddenly discover that their preciou war plan wa in deep deep trouble immediately the thatcher government start assemble a naval armada to sail for the south atlantic haste wa the order of the day the drill on south georgia island wa proceed around the clock the best estimate be that the drill would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three week on or about april if help do not reach south georgia by then the secret installation might be doom the force station at the installation itself be unable to defend themself under the circumstance their mighty naval ship be ship in a bottle they do not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the russian commando be arm with tactical and nuclear weapon to open the blast-proof entrance door would be suicide on april just two day after south georgia island wa seize some naval ship begin move out of british port the same day lord carrington wa sack a foreign minister he wa force to resign my friend because he have assist the rockefeller attack plan by downplay the argentine attack preparation that same day april new zealand the home of the other secret naval fleet break diplomatic relation with argentina the two hide new zealand facility have be place on red alert a a precautionary measure all submarine at the twin base be order to sea several surface ship be already at sea undergo sea trial but that still leave seven major ship inside the hide twin naval base include one of the nuclear aircraft carrier i mention earlier on that busy day of april argentina foreign minister costum mendez wa at the united nation in new york he wa alarm by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy costum mendez hurry here to washington to seek reassurance from certain official he get them for the next two week or so the news wa fill with story about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while negotiation go on that my friend wa only a cover story the royal navy wa actually join up and move a rapidly a possible toward south georgia island if the task force arrive in time to save the secret base a major battle wa likely the official story about slow movement of the british armada be intend to give a cushion of time for that battle if need be the fleet would have several day to retake south georgia island then it could move on to arrive near the falkland on the announce schedule in thi way the crucial importance of south georgia island would be hide and the big secret preserve it wa initially expect that advance element of the british fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two week that would have be soon enough to attack the joint rockefeller-russian commando team and stop the drill before it wa complete but russian cosmosphere and submarine make a shamble of the plan key advance element of the south georgia attack contingent leave ascension island early april two day before it wa announce officially shortly after they do so they run into trouble russian cosmosphere and attack submarine close in on a single ship which wa critical to the plan counterassault on south georgia island the cosmosphere bombard the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation in moment the ship wa without any command it communication and radar silence then a russian sub close in and quickly finish off thi key british ship with torpedo it break apart with secondary explosion and sink rapidly so far a be know there be no survivor thi unexpected shock in the mid-atlantic produce two result both important first it cause a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic by the british armada the task force have to be regroup into a configuration better suit for an enroute defense but that cost valuable time public announcement from london about the progress of the fleet reflect thi slowdown the timetable for arrival on battle station near the falkland start stretch out longer and longer all thi buy extra time for the joint commando team on south georgia island the drill continue the other result of the sink wa equally important word wa flash to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible action it wa obviou that the russian navy wa get involve in the atlantic which mean that the royal navy could be in big trouble during the dead of night early april the seven stealth ship put to sea from their twin secret basis in southern new zealand they deploy to a secret operational headquarter area in the antipode island mile southeast of new zealand their electromagnetic shield be operate to provide protection from attack these shield make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it a i explain last month but once they arrive at the antipode the stealth ship hook up to buoy equip with shield communication cable to the island headquarter the antipode headquarter in turn wa in constant touch with the south georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of south america the deployment of the available ship of the south pacific stealth fleet wa exactly what the joint rockefeller-russian planner have hop for the ship have be flush out from their essentially invulnerable hide place in new zealand the british ship sink of april wa also follow by other event on april the argentine navy start move out of port the same day alexander haig arrive again in bueno aire supposedly he wa there a a diplomat but in reality he wa there a a general deal with general haig be the top governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel a i have reveal in the past he wa make sure that the argentine do not get cold foot and back down at that critical moment fmy day later april haig leave for washington a he board hi plane haig somberly tell reporter time be run out and so it wa my friend for the secret south georgia base the very next day april the drill break through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base bolshevik military analyst in london have not expect that it could be complete until at least the follow weekend the british fleet wa still out of range the weapon which the commando team insert down through the long hole wa a small compact russian neutron bomb when it wa detonate inside the confine of the huge artificial cave the effect be devastate the intense radiation instantly kill everyone inside the base also the heat and blast effect of the bomb be believe to have damage all the ship inside sufficiently to badly disable them meanwhile russian cosmosphere and submarine be converge on the stealth ship which be near the antipode island await order from a distance the ship be invisible to the eye due to their protective shield which also protect against beam-weapon attack but they be sit duck for the tactic which the russian employ floating overhead the cosmosphere locate the seven ship use their psychoenergetic range-finding equipment know a prf a i have report in the past there be no method know by which prf can be jam the cosmosphere radio the exact location of the ship to the attack submarine the sub be arm with special non-homing non-nuclear torpedo design to explode on impact more sophisticate torpedo would have be throw off course or detonate prematurely by the protective shield of each ship but these simple torpedo just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode within minute after the attack begin all seven bolshevik stealth ship be on their way to the bottom and with them go their bolshevik commander and mercenary crew collect from around the world the south pacific action take place just after sunset local time the time here in washington wa around april that even secretary of state haig wa see briefly in public with the new british foreign minister franci pym pym wa wear the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomat be teach alway to display in public but not haig haig wa grin from ear to ear and no wonder the joint rockefeller-russian military operation have be a brilliant succes the secret bolshevik south atlantic fleet have be virtually wipe out bottle up inside south georgia island and the south pacific fleet while not totally wipe out have be badly cripple by work together the rockefeller cartel and the russian have win the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic a i say these word news report give the impression that war be about to erupt in the south atlantic but the real war in the southern hemisphere be already over what we be watch now be the begin of it bloody aftermath that aftermath be the battle for the falkland island they have be promise to argentina a a reward for her role in the secret war at thi moment the bolshevik here in washington be press for a public announcement that the united state will side with britain a soon a that take place military action will heat up fast around the falkland britain ha no choice but to fight she ha already suffer casualty which can not be explain without a public battle but by fight the bolshevik in britain be run the risk of a humiliate and tragic defeat for the royal navy meanwhile the rockefeller strategist here be now concentrate on a fast-building anti-nuclear-war campaign on all side now we be hear about the so-called nuclear freeze movement there be documentary article publicity of all kind to sensitize u to the terror of nuclear war in recent month there have even be referendum pop up on election ballot deal with the nuclear war issue medical

the rockefeller cartel can not afford to let a nuclear war take place if it do they will lose everything because they be not in a position to control it instead the deadly enemy of the rockefeller cartel the bolshevik here will win out if there be a war and so the rockefeller faction be now do everything in it power to prevent a nuclear war the present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the rockefeller cartel create certain temporary common interest between them and russium but a russium new ruler know very well thi do not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the
