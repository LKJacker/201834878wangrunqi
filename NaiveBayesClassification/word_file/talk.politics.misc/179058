from clinton-hq the white house subject clinton president pres conference the white house office of the pres secretary for immediate release april pres conference by the president the east room edt the president terry do you have a question q mr president there a grow feel that the western response to bloodshed in bosnium ha be woefully inadequate holocaust survivor elie wiesel ask you yesterday to do something anything to stop the fight is the united state consider take unilateral action such a air strike against serb artillery site the president well first let me say a you know for more than a week now we have be seriously review my option for further action and i want to say too let look at the last three month since i become president i have work with my ally and we have try to move forward first on the no-fly zone on enforcement of it on the humanitarian airdrop on the war crime investigation on get the bosnian muslim involve in the peace proces we have make some progress and now we have a very much tougher sanction resolution and leon fuerth who be the national security advisor to the vice president be in europe now work on implement that that be go to make a big difference to serbium and we be review other option i think we should act we should lead the united state should lead we have lead for the last three month we have move the coalition and to be fair my ally in europe have be will to do their part and they have troop on the grind there but i do not think we should act alone unilaterally nor do i think we will have to and in the next several day i think we will finalize the extensive review which ha be go on and which ha take a lot of my time a well a the time of the administration a it should have over the last day or so i think we finish that in the near future and then we have a policy and we announce it and everybody can evaluate it q can i follow up the president sure q do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleanse in bosnium and the holocaust the president i think the holocaust be on a whole different level i think it be without precedent or peer in human history on the other hand ethnic cleanse be the kind of inhumanity that the holocaust take to the nth degree the idea of move person around and abuse them and often kill them solely because of their ethnicity be an abhorrent thing and it be especially troublesome in that area where person of different ethnic group live side by side for so long together and i think you have to stand up against it i think it wrong we be talk today about all of the other trouble in that region i wa happy to see the violence between the croat and the muslim in bosnium subside thi morning and i think we make progress on that front but what go on with the serbian and the ethnic cleanse be qualitatively different than the other conflict both within the former yugoslavium and in other part of the region q mr president by any count you have not have a good week in ymy presidency the tragedy in waco the defeat of ymy stimulu bill the standoff in bosnium what do you do wrong and what be you go to do differently how do you look at thing are you reassess laughter the president i do really believe that the situation in bosnium it not be a good week for the world but i do know that the administration could have make it different on the stimulu package i like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in thi day we have already fundamentally change the direction of an american government we have abandon trickle-down economic we abandon the policy that bring the debt of thi country from trillion to trillion in only a decade the budget plan which pass the congres which will reduce the deficit and increase investment ha lead to a low in mortgage rate dramatically lower interest rate there be probably person in thi room who have refinance their home mortgage in the last three month or who have have acces to cheaper credit that go to put ten of billion dollar course throughout thi economy in way that be very very good for the country and so we be move in the right direction economically i regret that the stimulu do not pa and i have begin to ask and will continue to ask not only person in the administration but person in the congres whether there be something i could have do differently to pa that part of the reason it do pa wa politic part of it wa a difference in idea there be really person still who believe that it not need i just disagree with that i think the recovery the economist say it be underway for about two year and we still have month of seven percent unemployment and all the wealthy country be have trouble create job so i think there wa an idea base an argument there that while we wait for the lower interest rate and the deficit reduction and the investment of the next fmy year to take effect thi sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward now i have to tell you i do misgauge that because a majority of the republican senator now sit in the senate vote for a similar stimulu when ronald reagan wa president in and vote time for regular supplemental appropriation like thi i just misgauge it and i hope that i can learn something i just be here day and you know i wa a governor work with a contentiou legislature for year and it take me a decade to get political reform there so it take time to change thing but i basically feel very good about what happen in the first day with regard to the congres q waco the president well with regard to waco i do have much to add to what i already say i think it be a i want the situation look into i want u to bring in person who have any insight to bear on that i think it very important that the whole thing be thoroughly go over but i still maintain what i say from the begin that the offender there wa david koresh and i do not think the united state government be responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatic decide to kill themself and i sorry that they kill their child q mr president to follow up partly on helen on ymy stimulu package and on ymy political approach to capitol hill ros perot say today that you play game with the american person in ymy tax policy he wa strongly critical of ymy stimulu package he say he go to launch an advertise campaign against the north american free trade agreement how be you go to handle hi political criticism will it complicate ymy effort on the hill with ymy economic plan and do you plan to repackage some of the thing that have be in ymy stimulu program and try to resubmit them to the hill the president let me answer that question first we go to revisit all of that over the next few day i go to be talk to member of congres and to other to see what we can do about that with regard to the economic plan i must say i find that rather amaze i do want to get into an argument with mr perot i be interest to hear what hi specific be but i would go back and read hi book and hi plan there a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cut we raise taxe le on the middle clas and more on the wealthy but otherwise the plan be remarkably similar so i think it would be i be interest to see if maybe perhap he change hi position from hi book last year and he ha some new idea to bring to bear i be glad to hear them q to follow up sir how do you plan to handle hi political criticism he launch a campaign against you do you think you can sit back and just the president well first of all i will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him a you do to me and if he change hi position from the position he take in the campaign last year then we need to know why and what hi idea be maybe he get some constructive idea i think the american person have show that they very impatient with person who do want to produce result and the one thing i think that everybody ha figure out about me in the last even if they do agree with what i do be that i want to get something do i just come here to try to change thing i want to do thing and i want to do thing that help person life so my judgment be that if he make a suggestion that be good that be constructive that take u beyond some idea i propose that will change person life for the better fine but i think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weigh into thi debate and not just to the president q mr president to go back to bosnium for a minute you continue to insist that thi ha to be multilateral action a criterium that seem to have hamstring u when it come to many option thu far and make it look a if thi be a state of paralysi the united state be the last remain superpower why be it not appropriate in thi situation for the united state to act unilaterally the president well the united state surely you would agree that the united state even a the last remain superpower ha to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the united nation q but you have a mandate and the president they do and that be one of the thing that we have under review i have rule out any option for action i would remind all of you i have not rule out any option except that we have not discuss and we be not consider the introduction of american force into continue hostility there we be not so we be review other option but i also would remind you that to be fair my ally have have the french the british and the canadian have have troop on the grind there they have be justifiably worry about those but they have support the airdrop the toughen of the sanction they welcome the american delegation now in europe work on how to make these sanction really work and really bite against serbium and i can tell you that the other nation involve be also genuinely reassess their position and i would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concert action that go beyond where we have be i do have any criticism of the british the french and other about that q would that be military action q mr president several of the lead light in ymy administration range from ymy fbi director to ymy ambassador to ymy deputy budget director to ymy health service secretary have issue statement in the last couple of week which be absolutely contradictory to some of the position you take in ymy administration why be that are you lose ymy political grip the president give me an example q example judge session say that there wa no child abuse in waco madeleine albright ha say in thi morning newspaper at least that she favor air strike in bosnium all of these be thing you say that you do support the president first of all i do know what we know that david koresh have sex with child i think that be undisputed be it not is it not do anybody dispute that where i come from that qualify a child abuse and we know that he have person teach these kid how to kill themself i think that qualify a abuse and i not criticize judge session because i do know exactly what he say in term of madeleine albright madeleine albright ha make no public statement at all about air strike there be a pres report that she write me a confidential letter in which she express her or memo in which she express her view about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior member of my administration to let me know what they think we ought to do next and i have hear from her and from other about what they think we ought to do next and i not go to discus the recommendation they make to me but in the next few day when i make a decision about what to do then i will announce what i go to do so i would say that either one of those example qualify speak out of school q how about the value added tax mr president the president what wa that q the value added tax mr rivlin and mis shalala both say that they think that that wa a good idea the president i do mind them say they think it a good idea there be all kind of argument for it on policy grind that do not mean that we have decide to incorporate it in the health care debate no decision ha be make on that and i have no objection to their express their view on that we have a lot of person from busines and labor come to u say that they think that tax would help make their particular industry more competitive in the global economy i take no that wa take a line against an administration policy q mr president a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representative come out of a meet with you and express in the most ring term their confidence in ymy understand of them and their political aspiration and their belief that you would fulfill those aspiration do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhance expectation the president well i do know about that and i do know what their it depend on what the expectation be but i tell you thi i believe that thi country policy should be heavily bias in favor of nondiscrimination i believe when you tell person they ca do certain thing in thi country that other person can do there ought to be an overwhelm and compel reason for it i believe we need the service of all of my person and i have say that consistently and not a a political proposition the first time thi issue come up wa in when i wa in boston i wa just ask the question about it and i might add it interest that i have be attack obviously those who disagree with me here be primarily come from the political right in america when i wa governor i wa attack from the other direction for stick up for the right of religiou fundamentalist to run their child care center and to practice home school under appropriate safeguard i just have alway have an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the right of american individual citizen to live up to the fullest of their capacity and i go to stick right with that q are you concern sir that you may have generate expectation on their end and criticism among other that ha hamstring ymy administration in the sense of far too great emphasi on thi issue the president ye but i have not place a great deal of emphasi on it it get a lot of emphasi in other quarter and in the pres i just simply take my position and try to see it through and that what i do it do take a lot of my time a president to say what i believe in and what i intend to do and that what i continue to do q mr president get back to the situation in bosnium and we understand you have make any final decision on new option previously consider unacceptable but the two most commonly hear option would be lift the arm embargo to enable the bosnian muslim to defend themself and to initiate some limit air strike perhap to cut off supply line without tell u ymy decision presumably you have make any final decision on those two option what be the pro and con that be go through ymy mind right now and will weigh heavily on ymy final decision the president i reluctant to get into thi there be those be two of the option there be some other option that have be consider all have pluse and minuse all have supporter and opponent within the administration and in the congres where i would remind you heavy consultation will be require to embark on any new policy i do believe that on the air strike issue the pronouncement that general powell ha make generally about military action apply there if you take action if the united state take action we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be meet we must be able to understand it and it limitation must be clear the united state be not should not become involve a a partisan in a war with regard to the lift of the arm embargo the question obviously there be if you widen the capacity of person to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace will it lead to more bloodshed what kind of reaction can other have that would undermine the effectivenes of the policy but i think both of them deserve some seriou consideration along with some other option we have q do you think that these person who be try to get u into war in bosnium be really remember that we have take care of hundred of thousand of veteran from the last war and we could take care of my prisoner and get them all home from vietnam and now many of them be come up with bill for treatment of agent orange how can we afford to go to any more of these war the president well i think that a good argument against the united state itself become involve a a belligerent in a war there but we be after all the world only super power we do have to lead the world and there be a very seriou problem of systematic ethnic cleanse in the former yugoslavium which could have not only enormou further humanitarian consequence and goodnes know there have be many but also could have other practical consequence in other nearby region where the same sort of ethnic tension exist q did you make any kind of agreement with bori yeltsin to hold off either on air strike or any kind of aggressive action against the serb until after sunday and in general how ha hi political situation affect ymy deliberation on bosnium the president no i have not make any agreement and he do not ask for that we never even discuss that interestingly enough the russian i would remind you in the middle of president yeltsin campaign abstain from my attempt to get tougher sanction through the united nation in what i think wa the proper decision for them and one that the united state and i sure the rest of the free world very much appreciate q do you wish mr president that you become more involve in the plan of the waco operation and how would you handle that situation differently now the president i do think a a practical matter that the president should become involve in the plan of those kind of thing at that detail one of the thing that i sure will come out when we look into thi be the question will be ask and answer do all of u who up the line of command ask the question we should have ask and get the answer we should have get and i look forward to that but at the time i have to say a i do before the first thing i do after the atf agent be kill once we know that the fbi wa go to go in wa to ask that the military be consult because of the quasi a least military nature of the conflict give the resource that koresh have in hi compound and their obviou willingnes to use them and then on the day before the action i ask the question of the attorney general which i have report to you previously and which at the time i think be sufficient i have a i say i sure i leave it to other to make the suggestion about whether there be other question i should have ask q mr president what be ymy assessment of director session role in the waco affair and have you make a decision on hi future and if you have will you give him a personal hear before you do decide the president well first of all i have no assessment of hi role since i have no direct contact with him and i mean no negative or positive inference i have no assessment there i stand by what i say before about my general high regard for the fbi and i wait for a recommendation from the attorney general about what to do with the direction of the fbi q mr president since you say that one side in bosnium conflict represent inhumanity that the holocaust carry to the nth degree why do you then tell u that the united state can not take a partisan view in thi war the president well i say that the principle of ethnic cleanse be something we ought to stand up against that do not mean that the united state or the united nation can enter a war in effect to redraw the line geographical line of republic within what wa yugoslavium or that that would ultimately be successful i think what the united state ha to do be to try to figure out whether there be some way consistent with force the person to resolve their own difficulty we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleanse and that be obviously the difficulty we be wrestle with thi be clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face and that all of my ally face and if it be easy i suppose it would have be solve before we have try to do more in the last day than wa previously do it ha clearly not be enough to stop the serbian aggression and we be now look at what else we can do q yesterday you specifically criticize the roosevelt administration for not have bomb the railroad to the concentration camp and thing that be near military target are there step like that that would not involve conflict direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider the president there may be i would remind you that the circumstance be somewhat different we be then at war with germany at the time and that what make that whole incident so series of incident so perplex but we have a i say we get all of my option under review q the diplomatic initiative on haitus be on the verge of collapse what can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale military operation the president well you may know something i do that not what my person tell me i think mr caputo and ambassador pezzullo have do together a good job the thing keep go back and forth because of the person who be involve with the de facto government there it obviou what their concern be they be the same concern that lead to the ouster of aristide in the first place and president aristide we feel should be restore to power we work toward that i get a report on that we discus it at least three time a week and i convince that we go to prevail there and be successful i do believe that there every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of person on both side of the ledger while we try to establish the condition of ongoing civilize society but i believe we go to prevail there q mr president would you care to make ymy assessment of the first day before we make one for you laughter the president well i say if i believe first of all we pass the budget resolution in record time that wa the biggest issue that confirm the direction of the administration and confirm the commitment of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment and that we could do it by specific spend cut and by raise taxe almost all of which come from the highest income person in thi society reverse a trend in which most of the tax burden be bear by the middle clas whose income be go down when their taxe be go up while the deficit go from trillion to trillion the total national debt and the deficit continue to go up we have a low in interest rate from mortgage we have lower interest rate acros the board we have ten of billion of dollar flood back into thi economy a person refinance their debt we have establish a new environmental policy which be dramatically different the secretary of education ha work with me and with other and with the governor to establish a new approach in education that focuse on tough standard a well a increase opportunity we have do an enormou amount of work on political reform on campaign finance and lobby reform and i have impose tough ethic requirement on my own administration official these thing be consistent with not only what i say i do in the campaign but with turn the country around the vice president be head a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operate and make it much more responsive to the citizen of thi country we be work on a whole range of other thing the welfare reform initiative to move person from welfare to work and of course a massive amount of work ha be do on the health care issue which be a huge economic and personal security problem for million of american so i think it be amaze how much ha be do more will be do we also pass the family leave bill a version of the motor voter bill that ha not come out of conference back to me yet and everything ha be pass except the stimulu program so i think we do fine and we move in the right direction i feel good about it q sir a follow-up would you say though that one of ymy biggest initiative aid to soviet russium be now practically finish if we ca pa a stimulu bill in my own country how can we do it for them the president let me recast the question a little bite it a good question laughter it a good question but to be fair we get to recast it we have already the first round of aid to the soviet to non-soviet russium to a democratic russium be plainly go to go through the first billion the aid that we agree with my partner in the to provide through the international financial institution which be a big dollar item be plainly go to go through the question be can we get any more aid for russium that require a new appropriation by the united state congres and that be a question i think mary that will be resolve in the week ahead in part by what happen to the american worker and their job and their future i think the two thing will be tie by many member of congres q the tailhook report come out thi morning document horrendou and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the navy how much do you discus the incident and what might be do about it with ymy nominee to be the secretary of the navy the president first let me comment a little on that the inspector general report detail conduct which be wrong and which ha no place in the arm service and i expect the report to be act on in the appropriate way i also want to say to the american person and to all of you that the report should be take for what it be a very disturb list of allegation which will have to be thoroughly examine it should not be take a a general indictment of the united state navy or of all the fine person who serve there it be very specific in it allegation and it will be pursue the only thing i say to the secretary-designate of the navy and the only thing i should have say to him i think be that i expect him to take the report and to do hi duty and i believe he will do that q mr president to back to russium for just a minute the latest poll show that mr yeltsin will probably win hi vote of confidence but there seem to be a real toss-up on whether or not voter be go to endorse hi economic reform the president i understand that q can you live with a split laughter can you live with a split decision though or do you need both pass in order to then build support for russian aid the president i believe the answer to ymy question be for the united state the key question should be that which be pose to any democracy which be who win the election if he win the election if he be ratify by the russian person to continue a their president then i think we should do my best to work with him toward reform you know we have a lot of other country here for the holocaust museum dedication their leader be here leader from eastern europe leader from at least one republic of the former soviet union all of them have terrible economic challenge a they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there economic slowdown everywhere and in a world in which there economic slowdown and difficulty all leader will have trouble have their policy be popular in a poll because they have produce the result that the person so earnestly yearn for you can understand that but if they have confidence in the leadership i think that all we can ask and the united state will if the russian person ratify him a their president and stick with him then the united state will continue to work with him i think he be a genuine democrat small d and genuinely commit to reform i think that we should support that q mr president mr perot ha come out strongly in what be perceive behind the line against a free trade agreement naftum how hard be you go to fight for thi free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplish the president i think we have the agreement ready in the fairly near future you know my person be still work with the mexican government and with the canadian on the side agreement we try to work out what the environmental agreement will say what the labor agreement will say and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement be the mexican say and there be some merit to their position that they worry about transfer their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission even in the united state to be fair we have some folk who be worry about that about give that up on the other hand if we go to have an environmental agreement and a labor standard agreement that mean something then there ha to be ultimately some consequence for violate them so what we try to do be to agree on an approach which would say that if there be a pattern of violation if you keep on violate it past a certain point maybe not an isolate incident but a pattern of violation there be go to be some enforcement there must be consequence and we work out the detail of that but i still feel quite good about it and thi be just an area where i disagree with mr perot and with other i think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrate more closely the mexican economy and the american economy and lead u from there to chile to other market economy in latin america and gife u a bigger world in which to trade i think that the only way a rich country can grow richer if you look at what japan and other country in the pacific be do to reach out in their own region it a pretty good lesson to u that we have better worry about how to build those bridge in my own area so thi be an idea battle you know you get a lot of question and i want to answer them all but let me say not every one of these thing can be distil simply into politic you know who for thi and who for that and if thi person be for thi somebody else ha get to be for that a lot of these thing honestly involve real debate over idea over who right and wrong about the world toward which we move and the answer be not self-evident and one of the reason that i want to run for president be i want to sort of open the floodgate for debate these idea so that we could try to change in the appropriate way so i just have a difference of opinion i believe that the concept of naftum be sound even though a you know i think that the detail need to be improve q mr president there wa a tremendou flurry of interest earlier thi month in the russian document that purport to show that the vietnamese have hold back american prisoner general vessey ha now say publicly that while the document itself wa authentic he believe that it wa incorrect do you have a personal view at thi point about that issue and more broadly do you believe that in fact the vietnamese do return all the american prisoner at the time of the pari peace accord the president first let me say i saw general vessey before he go to vietnam and after he return and i have a high regard for him and i appreciate hi willingnes to serve hi country in thi way a to whether the document have any basi in fact let me say that the government of vietnam wa more forthcoming than it have be in the past and give u some document that would tend to undermine the validity of the russian document claim i do not know whether that be right or wrong we be have it basically evaluate at thi time and when we complete the evaluation we tell you and of course we want to tell the family of those who be miss in action or who be pow i think that we be able to make some progress in eliminate some of the question about the outstanding case a a result of thi last interchange but i can not say that i fully satisfy that we know all that we need to know there be still some case that we do know the answer to but i do believe we make some progress i wa encourage by the last trip q i like to follow up on that before the normalize relation allow trade to go forward do you have to be personally sure that every case ha be resolve or would you be will to go forward on the basi that while it may take year to resolve these case the vietnamese have make sufficient offer to u to confirm good faith the president a lot of expert say you can never resolve every case every one that we could resolve all the case for them and that there be still some case that have not be factually resolve go back to the second world war but what i would have to be convince of be that we have go a long way toward resolve every case that could be resolve at thi moment in time and that there wa a complete open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be do alway to keep resolve those case and we not there yet again i have to be guide a little bite by person who know a lot about thi and i confes to be much more heavily influence by the family of the person whose life be lose there or whose life remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other thing which seem so compel in thi moment i just be very influence by how the family feel q ymy economic stimulu package be you do some kind of reality check now and scale back some of ymy plan ymy legislative plan for the come year include the crime bill the health care initiative and other thing are there any plan to do that and also do you underestimate the power of senator bob dole the president no what i underestimate wa the extent to which what i think wa a fairly self-evident case particularly after we stay below the spend cap approve by thi congres include the republican who be in thi congres last year when we have already pass a budget resolution which call for over billion in deficit reduction when they have vote repeatedly for supplemental appropriation to help foreign government i think at least fmy of them would vote to break cloture and i underestimate that i do not have an adequate strategy of deal with that i also think that if i make a good-faith effort to negotiate and to compromise that it would not be rebuff instead every time i offer something they reduce the offer that they have previously be talk to the majority leader about so it wa a strange set of event but i think what happen wa what wa a significant part of my plan but not the major part of it acquire a political connotation that get out of proportion to the merit so that a lot of republican be say to me privately mr president i like to be for thi but i ca now and we all string out and we divide and i think we need to do a reality check a i say what i want to know let me go back to what i say what i want to know from my folk and from my friend in the senate on and republican or democrat be what could i have do differently to make it come out differently because the real loser here be not the president and the administration the real loser be the hundred of thousand of person who wo have job now we could have put another kid to work thi summer i mean we could have do a lot of good thing with that money and i think that be very very sad and it become more political than it should have but the underlie rationale i do think hold a lot of water that it wa deficit spend that just wo wash q and redo the president no i mean you know for example you mention the crime bill i think it would be a real mistake not to pa the crime bill i mean the crime bill wa almost on the point of passage last year and they be all fight over the brady bill surely surely after what we have be through in thi country just in the last three month with the kind of mindles violence we have see we can pa a bill require person to go through a wait period before they buy a handgun and surely we can see that we need more polouse officer on the street that another thing that i really believe that once we move some of that money not all but some of it up into thi job package to make some of the job rehiring polouse officer on the street who be lay off that would be a compel case i mean person be scar in thi country and i think we need to go forward i feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill q mr president back to the tailhook report for a second that report contain very strong criticism of the navy senior leadership in general but do not name any of the senior officer do you believe that the senior officer who be implicate in thi include admiral kelso who wa there one night in la vega should they be discipline and do you believe the public ha a right to know the name of the senior officer the president you should know that under the rule of law which apply to thi i be in the chain of command there be now an inspector general report and the law must take it course if i be to answer that question i might prejudice any decision which might be later make in thi case i do really think i think all i can tell you be what i have already say i wa very disturb by the specific allegation in the inspector general report and i want appropriate action to be take until the proper procedure have a chance to kick in and appropriate action be take i have be advise that because i be the commander-in-chief i have to be very careful about what i say so a not to prejudice the right of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con so i ca say any more except to say that i want thi thing handle in an appropriate and thorough way q mr president could i ask you for a clarification on bosnium you say that you be not consider introduction of american force do that include any air force a well a grind force sir the president i say grind force q you say grind force could i ask you sir if you fear that use air strike might draw the united state into a grind war there the president i just do want to discus my evaluation of the option anymore i tell you that there never be a seriou discussion in thi country about the introduction of grind force into an ongoing conflict there q with hundred of thousand of gay in washington thi weekend for the march do you ever reconsider ymy decision to leave town for thi weekend did you ever consider in any way participate in some of the activity the president no q why not the president because i and basically i would participate in other march i think once you become president on balance except under unusual circumstance that be not what should be do but more importantly i go to the american society of newspaper editor a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make to try to focu anew on what i think be the
