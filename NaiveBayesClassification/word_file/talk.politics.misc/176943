from garrett subject re loser wa re stop put down white het male in article rigg bill rigg write in article tree of schnopium write in michael michael rivero write i do know what you a a white male do i do know what white male a a clas have do they invent the light bulb the automobile the airplane print with movable type photography computer the electric guitar anasthesium rocket power space flight the computer electricity the telephone tv motion picture penecillin sp telescope nylon and the x-ray machine two glare error here first white male do do anything a a clas individual white male invent those thing which mean nothing to white male a a whole second you neglect to mention charle manson hitler mccarthy jack the ripper ted bundy and a whole slew of individual who have do horrible evil thing if white male can take the credit for my fellow white male boon we must also take the blame for my fellow blight i claim we deserve neither credit nor blame for these thing white male need to wake up and realize that they be unfair ye but everyone else need to wake up and realize that be unfair right back be disgust racist and sexist why ca we learn to treat everyone fairly without generalize what stupidity gene make thi so difficult i like to buy the world a clue the word that be miss in thi whole discourse be not the b word or the h word or even the n or w word it be the l word loser that right when we boil all the crap out of thi argument it be all about winning and losing and nothing else let me explain in the meantime there be guilt for win maybe a fear that one do deserve one bounty or succes so there be a kinder and gentler type of politician these day bill clinton affirmative action and lot of discourse about person who do get it for those of u in the win busines thi kind of talk be mildly irritate but there be still no suggestion of lose who be d-fen anyway the answer be a plain a the horn rim on ymy face the guy be michael dougla pose a a loser thi be know a controversial cast but that baggy short-sleeved white shirt sure do look natural on mike do it gordon gekko will never look the same though woody alway dress that way did we really expect gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe without put up a fus what we be start to lose sight of be that bash d-fen be the same game a bash that poor african american slug that clint eastwood use to blow away all the time a that arch-wasp male gender george c scott declaim american traditionally love to win they love a winner and will not tolerate a loser and so on since we be talk in theory and opinion then i put in my first a rebuttle personally i love under-dog unlike bandwagon jumper i abandon team when they start win person that cheer for winner just because they be winner be insecure person who be afraid to be associate with something negative the political implication be simple if a many socialist and democrat do you consider society a finite pie to a apportion in some equitable way then you have to worry about who be a winner and who be a loser to tell whose side you be on that could be black woman today asian homosexual tommorrow and ye indeed white man some yet to be determine day when the balance of the pie ha finally swing against that minority on thi one point i agree the reason that person bash wasp be because they have be on top for a long time whoever be on top be go to oppres whoever be below them so that they can stay on top if hannibal have push on to rome after hi victory at canna we might all be bash the black for oppress u peacefull white person for all these century i seriously doubt that if the black have conquer the world that they would have treat their colony any than the white do the white race do some unspeakable thing to the other race of the world but they only do what any other conquer race would have do ie khan the real question be should we carry over that blame to the present generation who do participate in the crime would it do any good ha it do bosnium any good they be fight war that stop hundred even thousand of year ago my opinion be if there be inequity now then let change them but do blame me for what my ancestor do it would settle anything anyway either way you go the way of the winner be no longer the way to be popular at least after you graduate from high school but you still be popular at high school reunion but it beat be a nerd a i would imagine michael dougla would now agree and in the long run it be the only way to go that where you be dead wrong you do join up on a side just because they be win that make you spineles winning in high school and after high school be still the best way to be popular but it do make you right all the best cause in history be loose cause with only a couple exception winning only make a difference to other person not to yourself and what good be the opinion of other person if they only care how you appear ie a winner if you ca beat them fight them every inch of the way bill r at that moment the bottom fell out of authur mind garrett johnson hi eye turn inside out hi foot begin to leak out garrett of the top of hi head the room fold flat around him spin around shift out of existence and leave him slide into hi own naval dougla adam
