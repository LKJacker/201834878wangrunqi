from david veal subject re propaganda re re fillibuster in article hallam phill hallam-baker write in article veal david veal write in article hallam phill hallam-baker write or be they simply propogranda we ca know what phill really mean because he obviously use argument design to convince i make no secret of what i be up to i have state explicitly in post that i be a political propagandist on numerou occasion anyone post to thi group who be not probably ha the wrong group for example i have on numerou occasion state quite clearly that i beleive that certain faction of the gun lobby be the worst possible advocate of their cause and i be prepare to do anything in my power to provide them with a platform because they can convince person far better than i could hope that many person with a fixation on lethal weapon be dangerou and derranged if you happen to know a political position which do not have person advocate it who do more harm than good please point it out some person have even accuse me of invent such advocate purely for the purpose of have them trash a set of political view in fact thi would be a futile tactic because i could never hope to invent a character a dangerou a a man who i quite seriously believe to be mentaly ill and a potential psychopath unfortunately the local sherif office have inform me that they be unable to act untill he attack someone one of the advantage and draw-back of require proof on the part of the government before they may take action against citizen and part of the reason some of u believe weapon should be available so if you be to ask me what be the point that i be try to make from thi current argument on the absolute sanctity of the u constitution what would i answer we be not argue the absolute sanctity of the constitution in fact the fillibuster we talk about be in the constitution i object to ymy suggestion that the senate wa intend to exercise the power it wa clearly give firstly i see that the current u political scene like the uk political scene ha become tie to special interest rather than chase the convenient caricature put about by the medium and polititian themself for thi gay right cmapaigner environmentalist zionist jew foreign lobbyist whatever vote power they have etc i sugest that you look at who be really benefit the inevitable conclusion be that it be the major corporation own by the ultra-wealthy that have benefit regan and bush create what can only be describe a a welfare state for the rich i point out again that reagan only have a republican majority in the senate during hi first term and hi coalition in the house come apart at about the same time bush never have any real support in congres the real point be that everybody everywhere get their pork from the big corporation to the guy i saw last night leave a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he buy with food stamp he spend more in food stamp on junk than i make in a week and i not on government assitance money wa divert from program address social need and pour into the weapon industry in the form of cost plu profit contract lessee let pull out the old almanac in total government budget outlay be billion dollar in est they be trillion dollar an increase of approx billion dollar in national defense cost billion dollar in it wa billion dollar and increase of billion dollar that leaf an increase of billion dollar unaccounted for thi represent an increase of in income security which include retirement program housing assitance and unemployment benefit and i believe welfare cost billion dollar in it wa billion dollar or more than national defense start thi represent an increase of in the federal government spend billion dollar on medicare in they spend billion dollar an increase of in the fed spend billion dollar on house credit and subsidy of that like in it wa billion in health care service and research wa billion dollar in it wa billion dollar agriculture up billion to billion science up billion to billion resource conservation up billion to billion education up billion to billion veteran benefit up billion to billion trasnportation up billion to billion about the only thing i see which wa seriously decrease wa under the energy category primarily under supply and community development in the area of disaster relief and between the two of them represent a los of le than billion dollar where wa thi huge diversion in order to rectify thi situation there must be constitutional revision not that a stretch if the current government wa push by the president to create thi me would one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure be go secondly the form of thi revision must take account of the change circumsatnce of the role of the federal government only assume that the new role be a positive role we want to continue i see very little positive about it the constitution can not be use to frustrate the democratic proces the constitution wa design to frustrate the democratic proces so that the voter could be absolutely sure they be get what they want by the time it happen nor do i see put the brake on the democratic proces an inherently bad thing califronium rid the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it get worse if the peoplr want to have welfare spend by the federal government they will have it sometime or perhap most of the time the person should be tell no and point to their local government attempting to prevent thi through constitutional trickery only lead to the constitution be bring into disrepute phill would you do me the very great favor of repeat that in method will alway be find to bypas such provision and once the government get use to bypass those provision they will bypas the other up to the first ammendment cute we can eliminate violation of the law by eliminate the law thi be a major reason why the right to own gun should be exclude the implication that thi right be equal to the right to free speech be dangerou free speech alone be dangerou phill person know that ma ownership of lethal weapon cause thousand of murder a year the dangerou conclusion they may reach be that the first ammendment may also be the same dangerou mistake ok phill all you get tum show me be a clear pattern of reduction in homicide rate acros several country and that be it not current mind you reduction note however that thi be not the slippery slope argument it be because the right freedom of speech ha be chain to the privilege to own weaponry that the danger arise the advocate of thi pivilege must not be allow to chain freedom of speech to their cause such that if they fall freedom of speech fall a well such action be not the action of person genuinely interest in freedom who chain anything to freedom of speech by call it a freedom thirdly and most importantly i want to discover a mechanism wherby i can engender intellectual debate a oppose to totemic debate i consider the grave threat to civilisation to be the los of the ability to reason about the political debate at anything other than the superficial level the objection i raise to ymy base ymy case entirely on the assertion of the supremacy of the u constitution be that the currency of ymy argument be limit to the currency of the totem upon which it be base the danger of totem be that they can be reinterpret in different way by different person phill you a master of subtly change the subject i have base my argument against raw democracy on the constitution i try to explain why it be a good idea the only time i refer to the constitution be to point out it do contain the restriction on the veto and the senate you appear to believe be mean but just do make it in there the constitution do contain the fillibuster rule i only believe that the rule be a good idea you c dismis that a venerate the constitution because it be in the constitution david veal univ of tenn div of cont education info service group i still remember the way you laugh the day ymy push me down the elevator shaft i begin to think you do love me anymore weird al
