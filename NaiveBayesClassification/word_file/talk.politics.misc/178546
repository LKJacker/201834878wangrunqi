from garrett subject re limiting govt wa re employment wa re why not concentrate in article ian ian sutherland write in article steveh steve hendrick write in article paul schmidt write steveh steve hendrick write it be a failure of libertarianism if the ideology do not provide any reasonable way to restrain such action other than utopian dream you seem to be say that a limited government will provide more opportunity for private interest to use it to pursue their own agenda and ask libertarian to prove that thi will not happen while i ca offer such a proof it seem pretty damn plausible that if the government do not regulate a particular area it can not become a tool of private interest to pursue their own agenda in that area i rather suspect that it the sort of government we have now that be more likely to become such a tool and that it is such a tool in many instance pardon me for interrupt but why do anyone ever bring up other possibility beside more government le government or no government and stop there it seem to me that the problem with society go much deeper than government democracy seem to reflective of the majority of society both the good and the bad if you take away the government you still have the structural flaw in society except thi time with no restraint ye no why do anybody ever discus communal society like a kibbutz i never study it on depth but from what i hear the kibbutz in isreal wa very successful it be also very close to what aristotle and socrate believe wa the best sorry to detract from the discussion just a marxism fail to specify how pure communism be to be achieve and the state be to wither away libertarian frequently fail to show how weaken the power of the state will result in improvement in the human condition i suspect that thi be because improvement in the human condition a you define it be not the primary goal of libertarianism and would not be the primary goal of a libertarian government my impression of libertarianism be that it primary goal be the elimination of government coercion except in a very limit case but what good be change if there be no tracable improvement in the human condition who would ever support the change if you tell them it wo improve their life i know that there be and will be libertarian who will jump in now and say that it will improve my life i can deal with that all i say be that improve the human condition must be the primary goal of any organization ian sutherland ian who say anything about panic snap authur garrett johnson thi be still just culture shock you wait till i garrett settle into the situation and find my bear then i start panic dougla adam
