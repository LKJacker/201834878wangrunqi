from clinton-hq subject clinton president radio interview in pittsburgh the white house office of the pres secretary pittsburgh pennsylvanium for immediate release april interview of the president by michael whitely of kdka-am radio pittsburgh pittsburgh international airport pittsburgh pennsylvanium edt q for everyone listen on kdka radio i mike whitely kdka radio news we here at the pittsburgh international airport and with me be the president of the united state bill clinton and i like to welcome you to the area and to kdka the president thank you mike glad to be here q there be a lot of thing we like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have but some news be just break from lo angele i gues the entire country ha be kind of hold their breath wonder what go to happen in the trial of the fmy lo angele polouse officer we just hear that two of those officer the sergeant sergeant koon and officer powell have be find guilty and two officer have be find not guilty it a situation that be build for over a year since the first trial and now thi trial and thi verdict and i wonder what ymy think be thi morning on how you see the situation in lo angele in connection with ymy administration and what you try to do the president well first of all i think the american person should know that thi trial in my judgment be a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury a well a to the effort of the federal government in develop the case the law under which the officer be try be a complex one the standard of proof be complicate the jury decide that they would convict the sergeant who wa responsible for supervise the officer and the officer who on the film do most of the beat the jury acquit an officer who kick rodney king but also plainly try to shield him from some blow and another officer who wa a rookie no one know exactly why they do what they do but it appear that they really try to do justice here they acknowledge that hi civil right be violate and i think that the american person should take a lot of pride in that but i hope now we can begin to look ahead and focu on three thing first of all the importance of try to bring thi country together and not violate the civil right of any american secondly the importance of renew my fight against crime i think it important to recognize that in the poorest area of lo angele and many other city in thi country person may be worry about polouse abuse but they even more worry about crime it time that we renew my effort to go to community police put more polouse officer on the street pa the brady bill that would require a wait period before person could buy a handgun and do some other thing to reduce the vulnerability of my person to violence and drug and the last point i like to make be it seem to me that we have get to rededicate ourself to the economic revitalization of my city and other economically-distressed area if you just think about it if everybody in lo angele who want a job have one i do think we have quite a many problem a we do and i lay out a very ambitiou program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in my city i have dispatch the commerce secretary ron brown to californium to try to come up with some strategy for that state because it my biggest state with my highest unemployment rate which could then be apply around the country i want to talk to him and to the attorney general to the new head of the naacp to reverend jackson and to several other person and then i decide where to go from here with regard to lo angele and the other city of the country q let talk about what bring you to the pittsburgh area today there have be i gues there be a lot of discussion on capitol hill about ymy stimulu package you be lock in a battle with the gop yesterday a you say earlier in ymy radio addres you make some move to break that gridlock what bring you to pittsburgh in particular to allegheny county in particular to pennsylvanium with that battle the president well there be two reason first of all pittsburgh allegheny county and pennsylvanium support me in the last election because they want a new direction in economic policy we have pass my overall economic plan it gife the country a very different budget for the next five year than we have in the previou we reduce the deficit and at the same time increase investment in job and education and health care in the thing that will make u a stronger country but in addition to that i ask the congres in the short run to spend a little more money a modest amount of money to create another half-million job in the next year and a half to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more the plan pass the house it ha the support of a majority of the senate at the present time all the republican senator a a bloc be filibuster the bill that be they wo let it come to a vote i believe that senator specter would like to vote for the bill and i believe that senator dole the republican leader ha put a lot of pressure on a lot of the republican to stay hitch and they all say that thi bill increase the deficit it do thi bill be well below the spend target that congres approve include the republican for thi year thi bill be pay for by budget cut in the next five year thi bill be design to give a jump-start to the economy and i must say a lot of the republican senator that be hold it up when mr bush wa president vote for billion of dollar of emergency spend of just thi kind much of it wa totally unrelated to create job so what i try to do be to break thi logjam i hold out an olive branch i offer a compromise but i think that we ought to try to put some more american to work right now to show that we change the direction of the country and that the purpose of the bill q have you be in touch with senator specter or hi office lately the president well we be try to talk regularly to through my white house congressional liaison operation to the senator that we think be open to thi senator specter senator from new york senator jefford from vermont senator hatfield from oregon and five or six other whom we believe know we need more job in thi economy and know that we be pay for thi with budget cut over the life of the budget i present you know it ha a lot of appeal to say well we get a big deficit we should increase it more but the truth be that we be pay for thi with budget cut in the whole life of the budget over the next few year and more importantly we have thi program well below the spend target that congres ha already approve for thi year and they do thi for year with the republican vote for it many republican vote for it for thing that be nearly a important a put the american person back to work so i just hope that thi do become a political issue it ought to just be about the person of thi country and the need for job q i have some question from person who support you and some person who be skeptical about ymy administration it ha to do with their hope and also with their fear a lot of person who support you and vote for you in pennsylvanium i think some of them be now say we glad we get him in the white house but now look at thi incredible proces he ha to go through look at these problem look at thi gridlock and they begin to wonder be thi go to work can you pull it off and of course ymy skeptic be say well i know it wa go to be like thi the president well what i would i ask person first of all to remember that we be frankly move very fast the budget resolution that the congres pass be the fastest they have ever pass a budget resolution ever in history set out the next five-year budget target so we be move really rapidly and we get them work on political reform welfare reform health care reform a whole wide range of thing but it a big operation you ca expect to turn it around overnight it take year to produce the condition which lead to the victory i receive from the person in november and we ca turn it around in day but i think we make real real progress i would urge the person not to get discourage we not go to win every battle and not everything be go to happen overnight but we be definitely move and change thing q thank you very much the president of the united state bill clinton here live at pittsburgh international airport i mike whitely kdka news edt
