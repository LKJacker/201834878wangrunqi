from david veal subject re re fillibuster in article hallam phill hallam-baker write in article david veal write come to that under the original plan there wa mean to be anything much for the federal government to do except keep the british out that also untrue but at least we wander a little closer toward reality that the article of confederation fell apart be enough proof it wa there for just a tad bite more well ye and no the federalist paper be propaganda and it be therefore difficult to determine precisely what maddison etc be up to from them there be a couple of way to look at them one be we want you to support thi constitution so we say anything that we think will appeal to you or the more straightforward thi be why we think what we suggest in thi constitution be a good idea you clearly consider the former to be the primary situation they certainly emphasise a limit role for the federal government but thi wa not necessarily their true position well i know hamilton wa a dye in the wool monarchist and probably the authoritarian extreme to jefferson democratic impule but what would you suggest a a mean of determine their opinion on the government if we do consider what they write about the government and be write in support of something automatically propoganda to the point we must assume it be untrue or that they be say what they do believe and like the house of lord which it be copy from it wa give pretty wide power unfortunately they start to use them and thu the gridlock set in i wa aware the house of lord have wide power i wa under the impression be wa pretty powerles compare to the house of common and certainly do have almost equal their power the senate be restrict only that it may not introduce bill relate to raise revenue the senate wa le powerful than the house of lord in the period in question if the senate wa le powerful than the house of lord than we almost have to state that the house of representative wa also in fact they both be because the british government have much greater power than do the american system my read of the constitution and other write gife me absolutely no reason to believe the senate wa intend to make use of their law-making power in fact grid-lock appear to have be design into the system with the senate be a more deliberative body to act a a check on the more-often elect house the system be mean to be slow to react the problem be that it end up a bite too slow i disagree the system be not too slow it wa simply design to handle le than it ha demand that it handle a somebody in washington put it whose name i forget congres ha become everybody city council congres be more than capable of quick action and ha more than enough power and time on it hand if it confine itself to what it original jurisidiction wa and allow more local autonomy it be not a case of the system of government they create fail but that it be operate under a set of condition they specifically want to avoid namely a concentration of power it would seem then that the proper thing to do be not to reduce the power of either house in some attempt to grease the wheel all you get then be a system which move quicker to do stupid thing it would make more sense to make more decision at a local level on what basi do you suggest that the senate wa suppose to be some sort of rubber-stamp for the house you note that while the president veto may be over-ridden the house ca do anything about a veto by the senate the preside veto wa mean to be entirely separate until bush abuse it in a quite extraordinary manner it wa use more in accord with the intent of be a check on unreasonable legislation please explain to me how bush abuse the veto in an extraordinary manner the veto wa clearly regard a a completely last gasp measure it use wa mean to be restrict to prevent the legislature interfere with the action of the executive i fail to see where any restriction imply or otherwise be place on the veto it could just a easily have be read a a mean to put a check on democratically popular but unwise in the executive opinion policy there be no limit in the constitution to the president veto power regard what a bill be for previou president have use the veto for any number of reason most usually have something to do with their agenda i be really curiou how you single bush out a the president who abuse veto the senate be not mean to be exactly a rubber stamp body it be mean a a check on unrestrained legislation that be the extra measure build into the constitution in favmy of the statu quo of the representative of the state be not a reasonable restriction why be it not a reasonable restriction because senator be the magic holy number upon which law must be base if senator feel safe enough with their state constituency to stand up and fillibuster be that enough to indicate there a sufficient question a to whether a law be a good idea or not to re-evaluate it why one earth should be sufficient to enact a law which cover million person in very very diverse place and live in radically different condition why a super-majority be require any system in which the simple majority be give absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignore i do not see thi a a positive thing and for all that i sure the republican be look for pork a much a the democrat they get some legitimate objection to the legislation in question david veal univ of tenn div of cont education info service group i still remember the way you laugh the day ymy push me down the elevator shaft i begin to think you do love me anymore weird al
