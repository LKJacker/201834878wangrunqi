from victor victor buttigieg subject re cpu temperature v cpu activity lino montuno montuno write thi may be a very naive question but be there any basi for the claim that a cpu will get hotter when a computationally intensive job be run my friend claim that there will be little difference in the temperature of an idle cpu and a cpu run a computationally intensive job lino montuno i totally agree with ymy friend since when the cpu be apparently idle it be still in fact churn away million of instruction per second check for keyboard input for instance the exception to thi be for cpu use in laptop where the cpu can enter an idle state where it be just preserve it current statu but do absolutely nothing in thi case it need a hardware interrupt to get it go again victor buttigieg e-mail victor communication research group university of manchester
