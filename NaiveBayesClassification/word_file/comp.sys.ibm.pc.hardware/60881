from jim johnson subject cpu n p just get a system and be consider get a fan for the n p cpu the processor when run be too hot to touch so i think thi be a n p fairly good idea long ago when i do some electronic train i read n p somewhere that the region within a chip that define etc n p slowly diffuse over time and thi increase with temperature hence a hot n p chip go off-spec sooner n p ha anyone out there get a cpu fan i work for a small pc oem we offer both a personal and professional system line my pro machine alway have a cpu cool fan on and unit n p is there more than type there be several manufacturer n p do you have to remove the cpu from it scoket to install the fan sometime depend on the specific fan model n p do all cpu fan derive their power from spare drive power line all the one i see do many come with a connector so you do have to have a spare connector n p anyone have any trouble with cpu fan none n p do anyone have any evidence that cpu fan be a complete waste of money touch a chip after it be run a few minute you wo feel the fan be a waste n p how be these fan attach glue clip melt cheese depend on the model many use clip make sure you use heat sink grease or heat transfer tape or you will have waste ymy money n p roughly how much cooler will the cpu be with a fan a oppose to without an advert i read claim v tough to tell i do know the chip shed a lot of heat slmr murphy wa an optimist is ymy datum back up vium dlgqwk
