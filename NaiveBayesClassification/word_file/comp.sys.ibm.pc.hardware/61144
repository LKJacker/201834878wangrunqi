from ballou kenneth robert ballou subject re soundblaster irq and port set in article paul bartholomew write in article andrew andrew klossner write these disk controller be call device there be device that require exclusive interrupt ownership eg disk controller and keyboard there be also device that do not require exclusive ownership ie it will share an interrupt with another device eg no in a standard isa bu the one that almost all non-laptop pc use two separate interface card can not share an interrupt thi be due to a screwup in the bu design for example if ymy soundblaster want to drive interrupt number then it must hold a certain bu wire to or at all time depend on whether or not it want an interrupt thi preclude let another card assert interrupt number when two or more device in an isa bu pc share an interrupt it because they implement by a single card interesting would you care to explain to me then how my soundblaster pro card and my printer card be share irq successfully i assure you that they be both set to irq and that i have no problem my computer be a dtk ibm clone simple first andrew be correct although i can see where there might be some confusion it be indeed possible to have two card configure to use the same interrupt they can not share the interrupt in the sense that it be not possible to have both card active at the same time here be an example for some time i wa short of free interrupt i have a tape controller not a floppy tape that need one of it an old tape drive my solution wa to use also use for where my modem be i do thi because i reason i would never be use the modem and the tape simultaneously when kermit run it install it own interrupt handler for and use the serial port if the tape drive be to generate an interrupt kermit would not have a clue what to do the tape controller and since the tape controller would not be service it would most likely hang likewise when the tape backup software run it install an interrupt handler for that handler wo do anything for the serial port under do print be not interrupt-driven instead the bio poll the statu of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be send that why you can have ymy sound card and both configure to use try that on nt and see how far you get kenneth r ballou voice oberon software inc fax one memorial drive cambridge ma internet ballou the view and opinion express above be my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my employer
