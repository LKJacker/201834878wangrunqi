from richk richard krehbiel subject re ide v scsi in article wlsmith wayne smith write in article wayne grn by mike schwartz michael b smith write but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bu when it come to multi-tasking o when manage datum from a single scsi hard drive a scsi controller that transfer datum by dma allow the cpu to request datum from the hard drive and continue work while the controller get the datum and move it to memory ide also use dma technique i believe floppy controller also use dma and most board also use dma dma be no big deal and ha nothing to do directly with scsi ide do not do dma thi be because it like te pc at hard disk interface the controller move a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card then the cpu move the datum from the buffer to main memory where it need if ide do work thi way then it not compatible heck if ide use dma then you hear all kind of complaint about isa bu system with more than ram not work with their ide drife be the dma address limit of the isa bu and if ide do dma there would be trouble btw there be dma-enabling signal in the ide cable spec but the last report i hear wa that they be never implement because it would require a different kind of ide adapter and different driver richard krehbiel richk will do for me until amigado for the come along
