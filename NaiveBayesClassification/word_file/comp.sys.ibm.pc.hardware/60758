from carsten gramme subject list of ide harddisk spec configuration of ide harddisk last update collect by carsten gramme and publish regularly on there be explicitly no warranty that the give set be correct or harmles i only collect i do not check for myself there be alway the possibility that the set may destroy ymy hardware since i hope however that only well-minded person undergo the effort of post their set the chance of applicability exist if you should agree or disagree with some set let me know immediately in order to update the list if you posse a hd not mention here of which you know bio jumper set please mail them to me for the next update of the list only ide at-bu harddisk will be account for if not specify the landing zone should be set equal to the number of cylinder if not specify the precompensation should be set there be biosis that do even ask for it another statement maybe right ide harddisk do have precomp and lzone the precomp be a built-in parameter and lzone be use because most if not every ide disk ha autopark the jumper name be give a print on the hd board often only a jumper number mean the jumper a zero mean that the jumper be leave open a one mean that

describe a a master in a dual drive environment the drife be describe a a master and a slave thi be due to the protocal the take place between the two drife when perform diagnostic there be fmy link and adjacent to the way interface connector they have the follow function and be describe in order a view from the end of the drive with the first jumper describe nearest the way interface connector led when fit thi jumper connect the led drive to pin of the interface thi allow a led to be connect to the interface an external current limit resistor need to be fit in series with the led when thi option be select the value of the resistor will be dependant on the led type choose but will be in the range of ohm ot ohm dual drife thi jumper must be fit when two drife be attach to a single bu it fallow communication acros the way interface connector indicate to the master drive the presence of a slave master when fit thi signify that the drive jumpered be a master if there be two drife connect on a single bu then only one may be jumpered in thi way iochrdy when fit thi connect the iochrdy signal to the drive it be fit when the drive be use in host system that have a higher datum transfer rate than the drive greater than mbyte per second when use interleave thi jumper be not normally fit a most host transfer at a lower rate than mbyte per second there be fmy possible

driver be not affect by the link option an internal current limit resistor be on the drive for thi led driver refer to the product specification for further detail s e a g a t e there be a list of
