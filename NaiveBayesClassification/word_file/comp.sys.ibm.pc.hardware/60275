from sherwood geoffrey sherwood subject orchid v fahrenheit mini review i just purchase a viewsonic and and orchid in short i be happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card i have spend a lot more time futzing with the card so that be what i be go to write about the monitor be pretty the moire i have under simcity on my magnavox go away it be a heavy a i think it would be lb i think so much for the monitor on to the bitch session and test result in go with the modern trend the orchid card only support color in mode without a driver of course thi break any do program which use svga mode like most of my cd-rom the compudyne whiplash vga orchid fahrenheit and orchid f vlb all share thi limitation those be all card which mean it be an problem for them the use a weitek vga chip which also do support them the hercule graphite card do seem to have these mode but i do run the same test case a i do on the other board during the brief time i have it it wa able to print the splash screen for the grolier encyclopedium though which the card just print a hash which be why i suspect the svga mode be support the support resolution really annoy me you can do at if you tell the driver you have an nec they only have about six monitor list plu and if you choose generic you ca get any high refresh at all but at you be limit to seem to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do at it sure should be able to do it at higher vertical resolution wa the main reason i buy the card over the orchid f vlb i currently have and it will do hz a well the higher graphic mode all crash hp dashboard i just get off the phone with orchid and with the driver i do know what i have he wa unable to recreate the problem on the plu side their tech rep wa a helpful a he could be and boot up the program on hi computer to verify he do have the problem he do know why they limit the refresh to hz either the board be faster that the ofvlb for most thing accord to the hercule speedy program thi program test variou operation and report the result in i do have the number for the graphite card but they be close to half of the ofvlb ie slower but that wa run in a isa so the number be really comparable the follow number be all obtain use a mhz air motherboard umc chipset with mb memory i give range because the program report the number a it compute them and these tend to jump around a bite k mean thousand not m mean million pixel per second orchid fahrenheit vlb orchid chip weitek dib to screen memory to screen screen to screen vector solid vector style polygon shade polygon hatch ternary rop font the dib to screen test take a device independent bitmap of a face and transfer it to the screen i have no idea what be be do internally a far a conversion go the memory to screen take the same face and copy it to the screen my gues be after it ha be rasterize into a bitmap that can just be copy to the video display the screen to screen test copy that face from place to place on the screen awesome interestingly the solid vector and shade polygon show no improvement and hatch polygon ie fill with cross-hatching and ternary rop whatever they be graphic operation like xor maybe be a dead los on the i give two number for the font because i think they be cache when the font be first draw on the screen they be do fairly slowly the speed of the ofvlb then the speed increase dramatically sound like program to a benchmark to me i make no claim that these number mean anything at all it just what i saw when i run them on my computer i normally do write disclaimer but thi time maybe i better my test be totally unconnected with my work i program under unix on decstation be do completely without the knowledge bless or equipment of my company geoff sherwood
