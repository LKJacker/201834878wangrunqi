from khoo subject upgrading the processor on machine in case anyone wa wonder about upgrade their or clas machine without spend a lot of money i look into replace the processor on those machine and here be the fact a i understand them if you have a model or model you can replace the chip with either a cyrix chip for which will increase ymy process power by about for normal fuction and not at all for math function thi chip will only run at ymy original clock speed ie if you have a machine the cyrix will run at note window do not use the math function so it be a good upgrade if you be run window or you can get a kingston platform for with a on it which will increase ymy normal process power by about if you be run at originally but again it will not increase the speed of ymy math fuction i think that it will continue to run at even if ymy original processor run at a slower speed there be also the kingston platform for with a on it thi might speed up ymy math function a well but i be not sure if you have a model or other machine with either an or a non-clock double ie it run at either or in it then you can get an intel overdrive chip which be really an chip and replace ymy chip with it you should get about better preformance for both normal and math function the mhz version of the overdrive chip cost and the version cost the replacement for the chip be an espeacially good deal a it provide the math coprocessor which the do not have note that the speed rat on the overdrive chip be the maximum speed at which they can run if you have a then the overdrive chip will run at ie externally and internally there be no reason to buy an overdrive chip which be rat at faster then ymy machine you will not get faster performance you should be able to buy these chip from any of the microchip merchant that advertise at the back of pc magazine or pc week you might want to shop around a price do vary if you need a number for a source for a particular chip e-mail me and i will respond with a couple of source lawrence khoo khoo lawrence khoo computer consultant khoo econ dept harvard u
