from robert desonium subject re i do understand si mg joohwee student neural write mg i go buy simm recently and the sale person tell me that the mg be simm and simm and one can not use them interchan mg if you use one you have to use all of the same type do believe everything you be tell i can tell you that mix them between ok and i ca see why mix in one bank be not unles they be of different speed mix of and simm in one bank the two only differ in the type of chip it use assuming that the simm be bite wide here be the two equivalent configuration the simm use two wide of nibble and one wide chip for a total of wide the simm use nine wide chip these be equivalent because of the way that it be on the simm board at the simm interface they both act a wide simm sorry if too techie for ya mg similarly one can not plug in two simm and one simm to gi mg the system a total of meg why be that so if my system support mg of meg it ha simm slot can i plug in simm to give my mg that sound correct the problem be that if ymy computer take wide simm you can not mix different size in one bank why you ask simple if you understand why there be bank assuming you have a cpu or the datum bu the mechanism to retrieve datum from memory be wide so the computer expect to see bite when it ask for datum to get that bandwidth wide the motherboard link one bite be not datum but parity so i will ignore that in thi simple explaination to get bite that mean that a simm in a bank store only of the bite wide datum if you have a bu two simm be link together to get wide datum which be the reason why bank be simm wide and bank be simm wide if ymy computer require wide datum with parity bite use in some and ast you could upgrade by one simm at a time hope that thi message be not over ymy head but the answer to ymy question wa not simple i could of just say i say so rdd winqwk unregistered evaluation copy kmail w-net hq or hal bb qwk-to-usenet gateway fmy dial-in free usenet mail and newsgroup pcboard uupcb kmail call or member of eff asp asad disk serving ann arbor since
