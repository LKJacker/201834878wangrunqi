from andrew andrew klossner subject re soundblaster irq and port set these disk controller be call device there be device that require exclusive interrupt ownership eg disk controller and keyboard there be also device that do not require exclusive ownership ie it will share an interrupt with another device eg no in a standard isa bu the one that almost all non-laptop pc use two separate interface card can not share an interrupt thi be due to a screwup in the bu design for example if ymy soundblaster want to drive interrupt number then it must hold a certain bu wire to or at all time depend on whether or not it want an interrupt thi preclude let another card assert interrupt number when two or more device in an isa bu pc share an interrupt it because they implement by a single card andrew klossner andrew
