from penev penio penev subject re ide v scsi on mon apr gmt wayne smith wlsmith write in article richk richard krehbiel write so when you get multi-tasking you want to increase performance by increase the amount of overlap you do one way be with dma or bu master either of these make it possible for device to move their datum into and out of memory without interrupt the cpu the alternative be for the cpu to move the datum there be several scsi interface card that allow dma and bu master how do you do bus-mastering on the isa bu a an earlier post note through dma ide however be define by the standard at interface create for the ibm pc at which require the cpu to move all the datum byte with no dma if we talk isa at bu here then you can only have dma channel active at any one time presumably transfer datum from a single device so even though you can have at least device on a scsi bu explain how all of those device can to dma transfer through a single scsi card to the isa-at bu at the same time any one time mean imho a single byte xfer if i have fmy source of dma request ready the dma would service the one after the other if the bandwidth for the fmy together be lower than the bandwidth thi will work note that the bu master here be the priority mechanism in the dma controller penio penev w internet penev disclaimer all oppinion be mine
