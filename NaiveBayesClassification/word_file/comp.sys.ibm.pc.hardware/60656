from hlu hj lu subject re debugging possible hardware problem in article jfc john f carr write i run linux on an eisa system and i have what i think be hardware problem it could be software but i do see why i be the only one have trouble i like some advice on how best to debug thi the symptom when i try to build gcc i get unpredictable and unrepeatable result sometime a o file be not in valid format recompiling the file gife me a valid binary sometime the compiler abort or dump core but work fine when run again with the same input compiling the same source file with the same argument gife slight difference in a few object file note that linux unlike many other system do not put timestamp in object file so compile twice should give bit-identical result i also have occasional filesystem corruption on my scsi drive but that could be cause by use development software it could also be relate to my problem compile the compile problem be not cause by disk problem i get the same result whether i do my work on an ide or scsi disk i set the memory speed and cache write speed to the recommend value recommended for what do that be a junk i suspect the external cache but i have no real evidence for thi the motherboard be a nice super-eisa with kb write-back cache and a mhz processor what i look for a system test program to run under do or linux linux gcc fire up gcc to compile libc and kernel at the same time run suggestion about the cause of the problem bad memory bad motherboard bad cache suggestion about how to debug the problem change wait state of ram turn off turbo change bu speed swap ram
