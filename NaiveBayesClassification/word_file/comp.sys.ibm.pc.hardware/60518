from ykhan yousuf khan subject re ide v scsi here we go again in smace scott mace write in article wlsmith wayne smith write i almost get a hernium laugh at thi one you probably get one when you realize that ymy vesa super dooper local bu ultra high tech controller suck if anything scsi on a pc will be obsolete kill off by vesa local with any luck pc bu archeitecture will be doen any with by sbu have you ever see what happen when you hook a busmaster controller to a vesa local bu it actually slow down ymy system bu ide it must be real nice to get shaft by buck for the extra cost of a scsi drive then pay another for a scsi controller yeah there be absolutely no use for vlb except for video graphic and no ide could possibly take advantage the vlb because it run at mhz and bite do person forget that the ide wa specifically design to interface directly with the at isa bu we see ide come out for eisa xt isa and now even mca but at all time it wa a bite standard run at somewhere near mhz when you run an ide off of the vlb there no way that you run it at mhz it would burn up of course same go for scsi esdi whatever none of them run at cpu speed the only way to gain advantage with a vlb ide be to hook it up to a cache controller i suspect it would be much much better to get a software disk cache instead since you get write-caching a well because you have an ide and no one make ide disk that big i see some fuji ide drife go a high a yousuf khan
