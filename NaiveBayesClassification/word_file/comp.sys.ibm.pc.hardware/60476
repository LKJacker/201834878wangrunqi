subject re soundblaster irq and port set from arowatt rowatt they do have a conflict because technically do not use the parallel printer processor the actual number escape me contain a printer control register which enable the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller a then onto the main processor a int by default the parallel printer processor do not enable it interrupt line therefore no int will be source from the printer controller chip thu enable other device to use the actual note thi apply to com port also which by default do not route interrupt to the system bu although com software usually enable thi feature a it make monitor com port activity easier than poll the serial uart thu probably get the sound card slighty confuse window may be a different story
