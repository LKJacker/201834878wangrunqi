from glang gordon lang subject re how be a null modem cable kevin kimmell computer undergrad write i be interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem cable actually i have no idea so do count that last statement what i ask be what pin do it use or what be it specification i just want to solder one myself instead of buy one i do even know what port be use help me please at kevin i intend to use the cable for pc-to-pc transfer vium lap-link or telix idea and info gladly accept i do not have specific knowledge of lap-link or telix but my recommendation for any package be to follow each one instruction for make the null modem cable the reason be that each one may be different since there be really a standard for pc to pc communication the follow be a tutorial i write up that will give you an understand about and null modem but you should still check ymy software i will eplain a couple of detail of be a commumication specification for communicate between a computer and a modem actually it can be between any end system and any communication hardware the terminology use be datum terminal equipment dte and datum communication equipment dce spell out the voltage level the connector type the pinout and the signal protocol the connector be a but ibm ha set an alternative standard of the primary signal be transmit datum td recieve datum rd and signal ground sg there be other signal that provide control between the dte and the dce for example the dte announce that it be power up and ready to participate in communication vium the datum terminal ready dtr signal dtr be an output on the dte and an input on the dce similarly the dce announce that it be ready to participate in communication vium the datum set ready dsr signal dsr be an input on the dte and an output on the dce ok that five signal there be only fmy more of interest the request to send rt signal be an output from the dte and an input to the dce that be use to ask the dce permission to send datum if the dce agree it send an ok vium the clear to send ct signal for completenes the ct be an input to the dte and an output from the dce the other two signal of interest be ring indicator rus and datum carrier detect dcd these be both input to the dte and output from the dce rus be just what you would expect a signal to the dte say that someone be attempt to establish a connection to the dce thi be rather specific to the modem telephone line setup dcd be a way for the dce to announce that the connection ha be establish the local dce be talk to some remote dce there that it oh there be many other signal define but they be obsolete i have explain the nine signal that be on a pc the pinout be a follow name sg td rd dtr dsr dcd rt ct rus now to addres ymy problem at hand when you connect a pc to a pc a dte to a dte there be no dce pair in the middle and therefore the signal definition do work out quite right there be no dce to assert the ct dsr dcd or rus so the common thing to do be to not use these signal at all and also forget about the dtr and rt output a well if thi be do you simply make a null modem a cable that pas through sg and cross td and rd pin of one end connect to pin at the other end etc the problem with thi solution be that a pc that want to send datum ha no way of know if the other pc be ready it would have to just send the datum and hope it get through therefore a better null modem would include the pair cross a particular point a confusion be in the software area just because you run the wire do not mean that the soft ware will use them if you be use the built-in bio to control the serial port then the bio dictate what wire you need and how they be to be use but if you have a comm package such a brooklyn bridge or lap link or telix then those package dictate the cable requirement the only thing you can gues reliably be the sg td and rd the be also fairly common there be one more issue that need to be address here and that be flow control in the scenerio the dce be responsible for flow control and it be assume that the dce could possible over-run the dte by thi i mean that a long a the dte ha it dtr line assert the dce will send datum without request permission first note the contrast to the other direction of datum flow the dte must request permission by assert the rt line and it must wait for the ct signal before it can send and now in the dte to dte scenerio the question be do you need flow control the answser be usually but how for non-binary communication one common technique be xon xoff which be implement in software no wire be dedicate to flow control the td and rd carry the xon and xoff command thi type of flow control can be use in addition to hardware flow control but the problem be that you ca send binary datum because ymy datum might include the xon or xoff code and cause erroneou conrol signal a work around be to have the software insert and extract escape code but the hardware flow control be prefer the problem with hard ware flow control be that there be no standard there be lot of way to do it and i bet they have all be try one cornerstone of all the method be to use the for one direction but beyond that anything be fair game again you must look to you comm package for cable requirement but i bet you find that one cable if wire properly could work with all of the package a long a they be of the same vintage by the way i be familiar with one package that use and for flow control the rt be request to send and the dtr be ready to recieve the ct be the clear to send and the dsr be the request to recieve thi do not mean a differnt cable it be just software the clincher to all of thi cable stuff be that it be common to have the uart directly control by the ct signal which mean that the ct must be present even if you be not support ing it in software for these case you will find cable that short the rt to the ct at the same end or perhap the dtr to the ct other possible short might be do just because the software expect certain signal that you do have or do feel like provide because it would mean additional wire specifically i be talk about the dsr shorting the dtr to the dsr be not a good idea in general but you may find cable like thi it be a bad idea because it defeat the whole purpose one more gotcha signal be the dcd some software include the pc bio expect to see the dcd before it will work thi signal sometime get short with the dtr but my favorite null modem ha the rt and ct short at each end but the rt be also connect through to the other end and connect to dcd and of course the be cross a be the and of course the sg must pa through thi null modem work with most software the flow control if any can use the with the if ymy comm package do not specify the cable require for pc to pc connection then i suggest you use thi one td rd rd td dtr dsr dsr dtr dcd rt rt dcd ct ct gordon lang
