from wlsmith wayne smith subject re ide v scsi in article shaw greg shaw write why do you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bu first you can quote scsi spec till you blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bu capability then what the point who say isa wa necessary eisa or vlb be the only interface worth invest thousand of dollar a new pc worth of money in then do complain maybe it wa you that scsi wa so expensive on pc because all we have until a year or two ago wa the isa bu ie no one buy scsi for isa because isa be slow are you say that scsi on an isa bu be not an automatic winner when compare to ide you do read to carefully vlb-ide use the same connection mechanism a standard ide if transfer rate be limit by ide whether it interfaced to isa eisa or vlb matter not i get different transfer rate out of my ide when i change my isa bu speed on mine for one thing scsi blow ide out of the water hand down if ide ha better throughput why be it use on workstation and file server ide be just a variant of the old ibm mfm at controller at least that how it look from a software point of view it wa never mean to be an all-encompassing to be implimented acros different platform is there any argument that ide can or ca transfer datum from the ide drive at least a fast a the drive be able to provide the datum are scsi version of ide drife able to deliver higher sustain transfer rate to their scsi interface because of a higher rpm platter different arrangement of head etc given the original question scsi use only a a single hard drive controller be it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least maybe for the scsi choice to make any sence what do a meg scsi drive cost no that the nice thing on a multitasking o scsi can use both drife at once i get unix load on one of my pc along with windog and the o can only use one of the two ide drife at one time it pretty ugly if datum be go from one drive to another and if scsi ha the ability to perform that transfer without the datum have to go through the cpu or main memory then ye that be the optimal way to do it a far a i know ide ca do that but when the cpu want datum from both drife datum to be store in main memory be you say that scsi can grab datum from both drife at the same time and that datum to main memory also at the same time working off irq and dma channel on an isa or whatever bu i just buy at quantum for my mac at home i pay for it i have see ide drife cheaper a friend of mine just get a maxtor meg ide drive for that million byte or mega-byte with the basic interface he get close to transfer on hi do ymy figure include a few hundred for scsi driver no actually we talk about scsi be expensive simply because nobody do a common interface for the pc if they have a common read easily implement method of add scsi to a pc like a in a sun or mac then you find scsi the connection medium of choice so you say that scsi would have be the default interface type consider that the vast majority of pc do have cd-rom drife or tape backup or etc that most pc only have or have hard drive and run do that scsi hard drife cost a lot more than mfm or rll drife at the time and how common be scsi drife under meg to year ago there a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevent scsi from become the connection medium of choice i wo argue that the scsi standard make for a good well implimented datum highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bu when it come to multi-tasking o when manage datum from a single scsi hard drive on a single drive scsi be more expensive but on that point be it faster thi be what all thi be about do you get more performance for the money for all the person that will only have a single hard drive in their system regardles of the o will the scsi choice really give them more performance than ide but you buy ymy pc for expandibility so you want to add more drife or whatever true but expandibility can also start on the bu which mean the option be there for cd-rom drife or tape backup that run off their own card you can add many different type of device and acces them concurrently no argument thi be alway hold up to the first time scsi buyer a the best reason but how many scsi device will the first time scsi buyer eventually acquire again do it make sense to go scsi for a single hard drive system a scsi device work on many different machine i have a mac and a pc at home and move hard drife between them be very nice with scsi hook them up and away they go with all the post on the scsi i or ius spec be you really sure that pc and apple scsi hard drife be compatible and even if they be be the datum accessible from either machine ie be there no format partition or file table difference is it really scsi device work together better than ide device for instance recently i add an older connor meg ide to a maxtor meg ide the connor must be setup a the slave it will work no other way on scsi you set the addres check the termination plug it in and away it go so the c drive on the connor become a logical d drive to do is thi really a problem i have a problem with ide mutual exclusion i notice that the time it take to switch from access drive c to drive d be quite long a compare to the time it take to switch from drive c to d on a scsi system under a multitasking o thi be very noticable a many thing can be go on at once after have two ide drife in my system for temporary file transfer i have never see any difference when switch between drife nor have i ever see any difference when transfer file between drife or the same drive one neat thing that i notice lately a fringe benefit ha be the ability to add older almost dead drife a storage on a scsi system with little problem we get a bunch of almost dead meg drife that i add to my pc i now get the interface full but it do allow me to have meg drife meg drive tape drive and meg drive all on the same card that be nice a long a the power supply can keep up i do believe that there be the possibility for up to ide drife on a pc simply put scsi be handier than ide no mysteriou jumper to figure out but what about mysteriou and expensive driver to figure out at least ide do require driver that consume preciou conventional do memory
