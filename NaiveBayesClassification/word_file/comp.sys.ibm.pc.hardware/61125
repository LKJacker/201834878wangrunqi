from ben elliston subject cpu temperature v cpu activity organization compact solution canberra act australium thi may be a very naive question but be there any basi for the claim that a cpu will get hotter when a computationally intensive job be run my friend claim that there will be little difference in the temperature of an idle cpu and a cpu run a computationally intensive job from what i see in coursework most cpu never actually idle they will continue to service interrupt etc etc the clock will alway be run at n mhz no matter what it do i suppose depend on the instruction the cpu may use circuitry which ha more transistor than other instruction but if you consider the additional heat generate by only a handful of additional tiny resistor and then spread that heat dissipation over the cpu package the change in temperature to the immediate environment ie the surface of the package will be negligible cheer ben ben j elliston bachelor of engineering computer engineering university of canberra ooo ooo email compsol v also ellib uucp uunet munnarus compsol root fidonet origin compact solution canberra act australium
