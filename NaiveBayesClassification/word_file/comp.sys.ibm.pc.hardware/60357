from shaw greg shaw subject re ide v scsi wayne smith wlsmith write in article bgrubb grubb write point of view why do scsi have an advantage when it come to multus task datum be datum and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster do it have a better cache system i think scsi wa good at manage a datum bu when multiple device be attach if we be only talk about a single drive explain why scsi be inherently faster at manage datum from a hard drive ide integrated device electronic currently the most common standard and be mainly use for medium size drife can have more than one hard drive asynchronou transfer max why do you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bu first you can quote scsi spec till you blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bu capability then what the point who say isa wa necessary eisa or vlb be the only interface worth invest thousand of dollar a new pc worth of money in who say ide be limit to what about vlb-ide do anyone know how they perform you do read to carefully vlb-ide use the same connection mechanism a standard ide if transfer rate be limit by ide whether it interfaced to isa eisa or vlb matter not so at it lowest set interface in asynchronou mode average the through put maximum of ide in asynchronou mode in full mode it blow poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can a implimented on what system on mine for one thing scsi blow ide out of the water hand down if ide ha better throughput why be it use on workstation and file server the problem become can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rate and that be where the bottleneck and cost of come from not the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisim to use the through put given the original question scsi use only a a single hard drive controller be it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least maybe for the scsi choice to make any sence what do a meg scsi drive cost no that the nice thing on a multitasking o scsi can use both drife at once i get unix load on one of my pc along with windog and the o can only use one of the two ide drife at one time it pretty ugly i just buy at quantum for my mac at home i pay for it i have see ide drife cheaper the original cga cart back in wa i think the original ega card or pga wa scsi ha stand relatively alone in not come down in price mainly because we talk about pc and not sun or sparc or sgi or name ymy favorite unix workstation that be after million of pc buy decision over the year scsi ha have plenty of time to come down in price no actually we talk about scsi be expensive simply because nobody do a common interface for the pc if they have a common read easily implement method of add scsi to a pc like a in a sun or mac then you find scsi the connection medium of choice i wo argue that the scsi standard make for a good well implimented datum highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bu when it come to multi-tasking o when manage datum from a single scsi hard drive on a single drive scsi be more expensive but you buy ymy pc for expandibility so you want to add more drife or whatever the follow be why i find scsi intrinsically better than ide a partial list you can add many different type of device and acces them concurrently a scsi device work on many different machine i have a mac and a pc at home and move hard drife between them be very nice with scsi hook them up and away they go scsi device work together better than ide device for instance recently i add an older connor meg ide to a maxtor meg ide the connor must be setup a the slave it will work no other way on scsi you set the addres check the termination plug it in and away it go i have a problem with ide mutual exclusion i notice that the time it take to switch from access drive c to drive d be quite long a compare to the time it take to switch from drive c to d on a scsi system under a multitasking o thi be very noticable a many thing can be go on at once one neat thing that i notice lately a fringe benefit ha be the ability to add older almost dead drife a storage on a scsi system with little problem we get a bunch of almost dead meg drife that i add to my pc i now get the interface full but it do allow me to have meg drife meg drive tape drive and meg drive all on the same card simply put scsi be handier than ide no mysteriou jumper to figure out greg you ca go against nature because when you do greg shaw go against nature it part of nature too shaw love rocket uunet csn shaw
