from darrylo darryl okahatum subject re help add a scsi drive can it coexist with an ide eric bosco ebosco write first of all please edit ymy post wading through line of quote crud which person have already read make person much le likely to help you of course if you do want to be help that ymy problem is thi true i wa under the impression that person on the net have both scsi and ide work together no it not true you can get scsi and ide to work together but there be restriction at least with the adaptec you must boot from the ide drive there be no way to boot from the scsi drive if you have both ide and scsi drife you must disable the scsi rom bio i not sure about thi though and so you must also use some special driver to acces the scsi drive hmm i know that you have to disable something relate to the scsi bio but i not sure if it be the rom itself back in february someone ask about ide and scsi thi question get ask again and again at the end of thi message i include an edit copy of my reply you might find it interest darryl okahatum internet darrylo disclaimer thi message be the author personal opinion and do not constitute the support opinion or policy of hewlett-packard or of the little green man that have be follow him all day is it worth it to get scsi over ide will there be a noticable decrease in acces in xfer rate for msdo application isa-based scsi and ide controller generally have comparable throughput you might get slightly higher throughput with a scsi disk but you also pay more for the disk and up in some case you also pay much much more for a good scsi controller note that good scsi controller really show their power if they use with a good multitasking operate system like a pc unix unfortunately neither msdo nor window be a good multitasking operate system the performance advantage of scsi controller be mostly waste with these which leaf the advantage of be able to connect multiple device to the scsi bu a the only advantage however note that you can expect to pay a premium for scsi device if you only go to be use msdo stick with ide it cheaper and you have le headach will virtually any scsi device chain into the controller for my hard-drive bernoulli box cd-rom tape drive etc note the follow be true for only who know what the future hold for window nt and unix no generally you have to find driver for each scsi device which probably do exist unles you use one of the better high performance scsi controller these be typically bus-mastering scsi controller that cost around street price and up and driver that allow you to connect these controller to popular name-brand scsi device either come with the card or can be purchase for under list price example of such driver kit be adaptec ez scsi kit list thi work only with adaptec scsi controller corelscsi from the same person who make coreldraw list thi driver kit will supposedly work with any scsi controller card that ha an aspus driver like the adaptec central point pc tool for do support a number of scsi tape drife the documentation list tape drife unfortunately it work only with adaptec controller are there likely to be other with a scsi controller and sound similar equipment ye you will run into problem if you use a high-performance bus-mastering scsi controller thi do sound right do it it true though with one of these controller you probably have to tweak ymy system to get it to work with sound card floppy-controller-based tape drife like the cm jumbo and window i know i be to and back get my scsi controller to work with variou thank god for tape backup if you want a copy of my adaptec hint and tip file send email these problem be really the fault of the scsi controller card the problem be really with the general hardware and software design of the pc no standard however add a bus-mastering scsi card be what bring these problem to the surface and make them visible scsi hold a lot of promise but you can run into a lot of pc compatibility problem if you plan on use only stick with ide if you want to use window nt or a pc unix you have to make some hard decision a good scsi controller and more than one scsi hard disk will probably give you excellent performance at the possible cost of msdo compatibility i say probably because while i know thi to be true with a pc unix i do know if thi really will be true of window nt i suspect that it will but i do know for sure
