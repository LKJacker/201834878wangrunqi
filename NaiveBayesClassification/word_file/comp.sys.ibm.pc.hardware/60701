from robert robert plamondon subject re orchid v fahrenheit mini review in article sherwood geoffrey sherwood write in go with the modern trend the orchid card only support color in mode without a driver of course thi break any do program which use svga mode like most of my cd-rom thi be not the case the rom on the support vesa mode of up to in color vesa-compliant application should have no trouble set these mode but i forward ymy post to my software group just in case ca be too careful not that i doubt that ymy application be fail to run lot of stuff depend on figure out which exact svga they look at and do use vesa call vesa be still pretty new every new chip set confuse them the support resolution really annoy me you can do at if you tell the driver you have an nec they only have about six monitor list plu and if you choose generic you ca get any high refresh at all but at you be limit to seem to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do at it sure should be able to do it at higher vertical resolution wa the main reason i buy the card over the orchid f vlb i currently have and it will do hz a well i think we go to at least hz at and maybe more and it a function of the ramdac speed not the power we need to fix the problem you note they be already on the list if you really interest though take a look at the text file which hold the datum from which the choice in the monitor installation program be build working by analogy you can build up a new monitor definition that ha the right combination of refresh rate for ymy monitor keep a backup copy of the file once you build a new version of the file run the installation program inst and ymy new choice should show up thi assume you have the weitek v driver you can tell the rev number by look at the modification time of the driver be version microsoft use thi gimmick too the board be faster that the ofvlb for most thing accord to the hercule speedy program thi program test variou operation and report the result in i do have the number for the graphite card but they be close to half of the ofvlb ie slower but that wa run in a isa so the number be really comparable the follow number be all obtain use a mhz air motherboard umc chipset with mb memory i give range because the program report the number a it compute them and these tend to jump around a bite the speedy benchmark wa put out by hercule and iit who to my knowledge be unencumbered by any motivation except make the hercule card look really good so i take the number with a ton of salt texa instrument do the same thing with wintach try to make the look good compare to the a if anyone care it safer though not safe to use benchmark from unbiased source such a test lab columnist etc interestingly the solid vector and shade polygon show no improvement and hatch polygon ie fill with cross-hatching and ternary rop whatever they be graphic operation like xor maybe be a dead los on the i think you a large discrepancy between the result of speedy and the result of anything else in the universe on these thing i give two number for the font because i think they be cache when the font be first draw on the screen they be do fairly slowly the speed of the ofvlb then the speed increase dramatically sound like program to a benchmark to me font cache be a perfectly legitimate optimization window ha hook for it build right into the gdi what kind of silly be iit use of a hardwired the quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog then sit on a tack string in their driver not only be it useles in real application it lack the program elegance of the bart simpson optimization in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently draw string in off-screen memory and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be give that same string a second time in a row we call it the bart simpson optimization because bart the only person we can see benefit from it he could right i will not cheat on benchmark a hundred time and be do in half the time it would take to actually form each character i make no claim that these number mean anything at all it just what i saw when i run them on my computer i normally do write disclaimer but thi time maybe i better my test be totally unconnected with my work i program under unix on decstation be do completely without the knowledge bless or equipment of my company we do have any lawyer they all work for intel there use to be a lawyer in montana who do but he die robert robert plamondon robert pay no attention to the man behind the curtain i the great and gloriou oz have speak scene from a trade show
