from al al devilbis subject re cpu fan russest steve russell write deletion the attach fan look slick and work well but i bother by the potential los of cool if the fan go out at least with the power supply fan you can reach back there every few day and feel the fan blow ye thi be a valid concern imho with the directly attach fan unit i see it look like if the fan be to stop the chip cool would be a good bite worse than no heat sink at all in other word if the fan stop the unit turn into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to suffer permanent damage not just stop work temporarily i prefer to put a stock fan off the drive bracket or front panel to blow air acros the cpu depend a lot on case and board layout though my zeo tower case ha a passive heat sink on the cpu and it locate so the front fan which suck air into the case blow right on the heat sink if that fan stop the heat sink be still cool by convection air flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise essentially the arrangement you talk about and a good idea imho on-chip fan from fry electronic in the sf bay area be about i get the stock power supply fan for about steve al devilbis al
