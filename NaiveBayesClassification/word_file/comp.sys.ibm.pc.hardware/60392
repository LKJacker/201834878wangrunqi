from bgrubb grubb subject re ide v scsi wlsmith wayne smith write in article bgrubb grubb write wlsmith wayne smith write since the mac use only for hard drife ye the figure include a hundred for scsi driver thi be sloppy person and dumb what group be thi thi be not a mac group nice of you to delete both ymy responce and the item that prompt it to whit i just buy at quantum for my mac at home i pay for it i have see ide drife cheaper to which you respond a friend of mine just get a maxtor meg ide drive for that million byte or mega-byte with the basic interface he get close to transfer on hi do ymy figure include a few hundred for scsi driver to which i correctly point out the follow since the mac use only for hard drife ye the figure include a hundred for scsi driver thi be sloppy person and dumb a i say thi be sloppy and dumb you should resound by discounting the mac not give maxtor meg ide drive for example by give an example you give the implied consent that for mac info to be included in the scsi discusion ok once again with the scsi spec list why the spec list again we be talk scsi on a pc not on a mac or a unix box and we be talk isa bu or possibly eisa or vlb ok i will do thi v e r y s l o w l y so you can understand reguardles of whether it be a mac or a pc and be different from each other a be asynchronou and synchronou all of these have different speed and cost lumping them all together a be dumb and sloppy take again the quote later on a an example of the problem in the pc world the spec list wa so that you know where the number be come from in the article it show the article be correct in it stament about scsi but not consitant thi isi with the way thi thread ha go how do you tell tell me what the performance figure be with a single scsi drive on a pc with an isa or eisa or vlb bu already gave them you keep delete them so here be the spec on everybody again with some add info controler chip asynchronou range synchronou range both common to the pc world difference be mainly in software not hardware controller chip also call with burst thi be advertise a in byte for the pc and at these speed not the mac the pc i have not see the follow for either the mac or the pc or fast mode with burst and fast with burst on the other interface let speak ide range from asynchronou range infer from byte synchronou range esdi be alway although there be some non-standard version wlsmith wayne smith write theoretical performance figure be not relevant to thi group or thi debate i sure that there be some platform out there that can handle the of scsi xyz but the pc isi one of them note that i also give the average through put for which hold true a mac or clone with the correct hardware and software and since pc adversizement be use theoretical performance figure why can not we if we be to continue thi thread state clearly which scsi you be talk about or or scsi over all and it do make a difference well maybe if the scsi design person have their act together than maybe all pc would have build in scsi port by now with pc article like the follow it be obviou that the problem be not with scsi but with the person who report it like you look at the inconsitant use of scsi in the below quote my comment in although scsi be twice a fast a esdi thi be asynchronou with a chip faster than ide thi be both asynchronou with a chip and pc magazine april the article be confuse not scsi the term be a me from inconsitant use not because the interface itself be a me scsi mean the set of scsi interface compose of and not a some person want to use it to read consitantly the quote should read asynchronou with a chip although asynchronou be twice a fast a esdi one third the speed of ide or asynchronou with a chip or although with a chip and be eight time a fast a esdi faster than ide note the nonuse of by itself thi eliminate ambaguity if we be to continue thi thread state clearly which scsi you be talk about or or scsi over all and lumping everything into scsi a be sloppy wrong and dumb inconsitant and usage be also a problem clean it up now or have a me like svga wa several year ago because everybody and hi uncle slap an their own monitor inteface scsi is standarized unlike svga wa year ago except in terminaology
