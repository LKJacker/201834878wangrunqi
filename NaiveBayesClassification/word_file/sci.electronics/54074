from ifarqhar ian farquhar subject re atarus processor in article john john west write ifarqhar ian farquhar write wrong it ha a for those who would like to know the wa a without irq or nmi and with only addres line give memory space ye but still not a for those difference same instruction set of course it have one custom chip not an asic in the sense that word be now understand the tium sometime know a the although most other manufacturer list that a the cium complex interface adapter tium stand for television interface adapter and it handle sound paddle and the minimal video hardware the possess did know about it be call the that the cium find in the commodore i do believe thi chip exist when the wa around ye the same number but an entirely different device i should have qualify thi further by state that thi wa the pal version of the tium i be not sure that the ntsc tium would have a different number the tium wa map into the bottom byte of page and shadow in the bottom byte of page to get an image on the screen you have to wait until the raster line ymy picture start at load bitmap for thi line into the register tell them what x position to take how many duplicate you want etc then do it all again for the next line thi take all of the processor time during the visible portion of the display do anyone on the net actually have detail of the tium a thi be the only device i have not yet discover detail about atarus australium when ask claim that their attempt to get the programmer documentation for the have fail a the u head office have refuse to provide it to chip select the like to have rom right at the top of memory so the have to use rom with active high chip select not exactly normal so some cartrige have a in them to convert thi to the more usual active low chip select i saw a couple of cheaper device with and a couple of resistor hook up a a cheap inverter nasty but workable and cheaper than a inverter if labor cost almost nothing ian
