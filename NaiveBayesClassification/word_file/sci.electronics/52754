from whit john whitmore subject re help with ultra-long time in article pmu johnh john haddy write in article mcovingt michael covington write do use big capacitor they be unreliable for time due to leakage true especially for electrolytic capacitor at high temperature instead use a quartz crystal and divide it frequency by time or something like that would a crystal be affect by cold my gut feel be that a a mechanically resonate device extreme cold be likely to affect the compliance terminology of the quartz and hence it resonant frequency low power quartz oscillator be usually khz and these have significant temperature drift which one do often notice while wear the watch on one wrist low temperature sensitivity be available in other crystal type which unfortunately be larger and higher frequency mhz or so and take more battery power programmable timer might be le accurate but they be more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillator john whitmore
