from subject re lead acid battery part in article carter ame write i think the first thread wa hilariou so here go another post some more background information on what ha happen to my poor battery one year i leave the battery in the garage the garage be unheated they be leave in their place that they need to be one in the rid lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle the battery in the rid lawnmower wa about year old and one of the cycle battery wa new and one wa around year old upon spring time i discover that all of the battery be dead and need to be recharge they all work properly except for the older one and they have to be replace about halfway through the summer they have originally be store in the garage and i think i remember my dad charge them in spring last year i decide to bring them in to the basement which ha two part one be dirt and brick and the other be concrete i bring in all three and discover in the spring about day ago that not only be the battery dead but when i put the charger on them the charger say hmmmmmmmm and the amp-meter read around in other word it wa pin the internal circut trip and i go on to the other battery they be the same realizing that we still have gigantic sailboat battery also lead acid i decide to put the charger on them these have be sit for around and a half year on the brick and dirt part and notice that they only need a small charge around hour or so on trickle i test them by use them at the local ga station for give jump start and they work fine for around of thi lead me to believe one of several thing i buy really tty battery last year sortum true the concrete ha something to do with the discharge of the battery there wa enough moisture to short out the terminal in the room where the concrete be the dirt room wa able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room any other idea could be the alien anything be possible the lead-acid secondary cell release energy electricity with the follow chemical reaction pb lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water the standard heat of formation at c f of the variou compound be heat of formation compound at c pb the heat of reaction at c be therefore kcal per mole produce note that lead sulfate be not very soluble gram per gram water at c and it will thu precipitate out of solution where the reaction be occur or the cathode positive terminal of the battery i be almost sure it be the positive terminal where the precipitate form but i may be wrong oh well i do have a corrode battery to corrobate and i do feel like think through it right now what be important to notice here be that the reaction a you know it would be be exothermic or energy discharge if moisture with dissolve electrolyte acid rain condense on the battery a conductive path between the terminal may form thi will discharge the battery a the chemical reaction proceed the reaction be reversible if electricity from an alternator or battery charger be put back into the battery lead-acid battery must change in chemical composition to discharge each cell ha all the reactant necessary for the reaction the non-reacting post terminal of the lead-acid battery be there to remove or add electric energy during a discharge or charge because the reaction be exothermic it ha a tendency to happen though quite slowly under normal circumstance so while keep the battery dry be a good idea it be not a total solution to understand why lead-acid battery do indeed discharge faster when store on concrete a oppose to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechatelier principle which can be paraphrase a anything subject to some stres will act to move to a more comfortable position here be the thermal conductivity of a some select material thermal conductivity material temperature c f btu hr-ft-ft diatomaceou earth natural acros stratum diatomaceou natural parallel to stratum diatomaceou earth powder density concrete cinder stone dry pine acros grain parallel to grain oak acros grain maple acros grain note that the thermal conductivity for dirt diatomaceou earth go down with temperature also c be about k and the value for earth powder be on the same order of magnitude a natural earth the thermal conductivity of concrete be around a factor of greater than that of dirt and be time greater than wood it be these difference in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood at any instant the discharge reaction be occur energy be be release either a electricity or heat thermal conductivity of air be about btu hr-ft-ft during storage except for the trickle that pas through any condensate on the battery thi energy be mostly release a heat the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface thu if you perfectly insulate a dry battery on all but the bottom surface at any give battery temperature above the storage surface temperature the battery on a concrete surface will be discharge about time faster than that on dirt thi be where lechatelier principle come into play removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion if the reaction normally occur at room temperature keep the battery at that temperature require the removal of any heat produce a concrete surface be a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface store a battery in the corner of a pour concrete basement and you have surface remove energy which pull the reaction along also if water evaporate from the battery that elevate the ratio of sulfuric acid to water thi will tend to drive the discharge reaction jeff white how do i get the
