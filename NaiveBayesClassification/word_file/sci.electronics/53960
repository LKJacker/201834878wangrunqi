from karplu kevin karplu subject re decouple cap onboard i use on-chip capacitor to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small systolic array chip that have load on the clock line design wa in n-well cmo use the mosi scalable design rule here be some think on the bypas capacitor they do help much with simultaneou output switch there be still a large inductance between the bypas capacitor and the load capacitor on both the signal line and the grind return so you still get grind and power line bounce they do help a lot with on-chip load a i have with the high load on the clock line the transient you be try to suppres be really high frequency so forget about large area of poly-thin-oxide-diff capacitor since the rc time constant be too large what i do be to make a metal poly diff sandwich but put a lot of hole in the poly layer allow frequent contact i forget exactly how wide the poly line be if i be do thi design again i probably omit the diff altogether and use a solid poly sheet instead use just and poly and substrate but that ha such a high resistance it can be ignore at these speed you be probably better off try to tune ymy circuit to run with slightly slower edge and lower voltage swing especially for output signal than spend chip area on capacitor i have spare space on the die since the circuit wa too big for a mosi tiny chip and the next size up wa twice a big a i need kevin karplu kevin karplu karplu due to budgetary constraint the light at the end of the tunnel be be turn off
