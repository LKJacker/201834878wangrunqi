from webb webber ah subject re adcom cheap product i want to upgrade my system and wa think of buy adcom seperate i have hear from alot of person though that adcom sound great but that the component be make cheaply and therefore wo last very long the time estimate i hear be like only or year is thi true i own the adcom power amp a far a i concern there no amp which can touch it at the price range the build quality be very impressive and be far superior to other amp in the price range the whole amplifier be extremely solid with massive heat sink and very solid case if you open the amp up there be only very good quality component in and the amp seem to be design extremely well perfect symmetry for both channel and two transformer one for each channel the bind post on the back of the amplifier be virtually the same a those on the classe model ie very good i wa also sceptical about the amp be build in the far-east or where-ever but if you look in the amp and see what component they use and how it wa design you can easily see why the amplifier sound so brilliant i can not see why person say the amplifier wo last not with those quality component inside sure the amp run very fairly hot but that how you get an amp to sound incredibly good my last point i recently audition the adcom preamp something like the or something it wa two year old and it still sound like new if you build an amplifier decently like the adcom they will sound brilliant and last a long time period just my think but then i do own one of adcom amp alan webber webb webb the path you tread be narrow and the drop be sheer and very high the raven all be watch from a vantage point near by apprehension creep like a choo-train up ymy spine will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme
