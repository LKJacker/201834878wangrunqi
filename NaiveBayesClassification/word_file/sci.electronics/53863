from jeff jeff gruszynski subject re digital voltmeter how do it work mamishev alexander valentino write hello let me introduce a problem when i measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter use ac mode my output be an rm value a peak value over square right when i measure a square wave in the same mode ac my output be equal to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave i assume that a digital voltmeter make some kind of integration of the input value and divide it over the wave period right now i use it to measure the same square wave a above but distort by high-frequency harmonic ideally output should be the same but the output value wa only about of the previou one why what be the nature of thi output value what do the voltmeter actually measure and what do it show re rm read unles the dvm say it measure rm it probably average voltage the input be diode rectify and measure a dc if it say it rm and but measure incorrectly it measure average and multipling by a correction that only true for sine wave vave vrm if you want correct rm for most any waveform you need a true-rm which literally do the root-mean-square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry related question le important to me what be advantage and disadvantage of digital voltmeter to compare with analog one the last significant advantage of analog imo wa be able to see the signal if it wa change over time check electrolytic capacitor anymore most dmm have bargraph etc that duplicate thi thank you for ymy attention you could mail me ymy opinion at or open a discussion here i would appreciate either way alexander v mamishev power system automation laboratory phone office department of electrical engineering phone home texa a m university fax college station tx usa internet jeff gruszynski semiconductor test equipment system engineer hewlett-packard or t jeff jeff
