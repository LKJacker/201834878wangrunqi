from et eric h taylor subject re electronic tesla coil in article dp david prutchi write in article long jerry long write fred w culpepper fculpepp write a couple of year ago i put together a tesla circuit which wa publish in an electronic magazine and could have be the circuit which be refer to here thi one use a flyback transformer from a tv onto which you wind ymy own primary wind it also use power transistor in a to year ago i build a volt tesla and the thing wa very spectacular but beside friend depend on their knowledge of science and generate strong emi i never find anything useful that could be do with it is there any real-world application for tesla coil today david prutchi first of all realize that tesla invent ac power generator motor transformer conductor etc technically all transformer be tesla coil in general though when someone refer to a tesla coil they mean an air core resonant transformer the tv flyback version tesla coil see the for diagram ha not an air core it be of a clas of circuit call oscillating shuttle circuit osc generally osc be highly efficient but thi version use transistor and resistor which be very lossy device typically tesla use active reactance instead of passive resistor so that he could achieve efficiency of and better the usual application of an air-core resonant transformer or of an osc be to produce strong emi for wireles broadcast how well do you think ymy computer screen would work if we remove the hf hv tesla flyback coil from it if we be to remove from my home and industry all tesla coil my light would go dark my car would sputter and die my radio would go silent my industry would grind to a halt and we would have to go back to use coal for heat ga for lamp horse for transportation steam for power and telegraph for communication is that real world enough for you get the message we would not have the convienience we have today if not for tesla give credit where credit is due if it have be up to edison we still be in the century flame me at ymy own peril i very good at put edison down et tesla wa year ahead of hi time perhap now hi time come
