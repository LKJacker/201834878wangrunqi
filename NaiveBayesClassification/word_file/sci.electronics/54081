from fmg filip gieszczykiewicz subject switching ps question greeting i recently decide to chuck the linear regulator and learn the black magic art of switch power supply before anyone flame me i know both have their place anyway i build the basic up down converter with pretty good result efficiency but i run into problem when i try to design build anything that put out seriou amp i know it can be do i have some gut on my bench but something puzzle me i use a simple choke a the storage element basicly a toroid with a single wind but all commercial model use transformer with many wind i trace a few and they seem to use some of the wind for the usual but some of the other seem to loose me what be they for better than that anyone have a full schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of i love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such low volume my other problem in get high amp good efficiency be lack of source of ideal component calculate and limited knowledge of the whole topic i do thi on my own not school mind you in fact i have yet to take any course that cover transistor so be the answer to the accumulation of dead commercial model and truning into a scavanger not that it not what i do now and get understand schematic and a bite more of the mind-boggling theory take care my goal be in car battery out and on the other end and the distance between the two will be more than foot of gauge but le than foot would like to have a work model in a year or so do i have a chance to make it filip i buy a vowel gieszczykiewicz best e-mail fmgst all idea be mine but they can be your for only so respond now i live for my ee major winsurfing program sca and assort dream drive linux ha and ms-do ha ms-do be worry
