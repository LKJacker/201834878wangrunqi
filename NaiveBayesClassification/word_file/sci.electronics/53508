from david glen jacobowitz subject dumb question function generator i have a new scope and i think i save a few buck by buy one with a function generator build in after have it awhile i notice two thing about the function generator for one there seem to be a bia even when the be push in that be i have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal san some random bia the other really annoy thing be that the damn output wo go below about p-p i be a student you may have guess from my previou post and i often have to measure the input impedance of variou circuit i of the circuit have maximum input signal of way le than amplitude and most have input impedance in the of kohm range the thing be in order to use my function generator i have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable then of course to measurethe input impedance of my circuit i be go to have to throw in another resistor in series with the output of the generator i could just ignore it but now with thi little divider there i have to figure that in it kind of a pain in the a is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve thi little problem the box would tka the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that be some low unchanging number i would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so i could just build a little buffer amp but i like to have thi box not be active any quick idea the scope not break for other reason i have send it to the shop to get repair and they replace it the function generator wa the same way on that one too please help a i be feel very stupid today dave
