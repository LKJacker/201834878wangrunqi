from wellison subject re help with ultra-long time thank for the respose a they be all good idea and i be look at use a couple of the idea i recieved in the mail today the spec sheet on the mil spec version of exar chip it be stable down to c and suck very little power they show an application for a ultra-long time delay up to several year depend on the rc time constant in thi application they have two of them cascade together the reset and trigger pin of both chip be tie together and the timebase of the second chip be disable in thi configuration the output be high when the system be reset when trigger the output go low and stay that way for a total of x the time cycle of the first chip the total time cycle of the two chip can be program from to x r x c to x r x c in step by select any combination of the counter output to the timer output the beauty of it be the timebase chip would only have to have a time cap and a resistor for second per time cycle so i can get a maximum of second between time cycle x or about day of course that much more than i need day but the counter allow for binary step that can be select for the output for the puker after the first day and it trip it would reset it self for the next day time cycle and so forth power be still a problem though a few idea that you suggest wa to bury the electronic in a hole dig in the snow a an insulator and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimate snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack i like that idea thi thing ha to work for at least six week for three sample and the ga valf be volt to spit the pellet out onto the snow anyway i order the to see what i can do with them should be interest a long a i not the one that ha to go dig up the pellet in the middle of antartica freeze my bun off thank again everyone we
