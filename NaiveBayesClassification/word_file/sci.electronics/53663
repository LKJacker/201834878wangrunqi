from schmidt subject grounding power wire wa re a question about outlet wire there ha be quite a bite of discussion about house wire and ground practice here a few point need to be clarify the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wire method be use a a safety grind to carry fault current back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal object it should never except for a few exception to be discuss later carry the normal operate current of a connect load some equipment ha filter in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the ground conductor much communication or audio equipment be sensitive to noise or slight voltage on the ground conductor and may require special wire of the ground conductor to provide reliable operation orange outlet be often use for thi with insulate ground conductor wire back to the panel box and in many case back to the service anyone instal such a system should read both the section on ground in the national electric code and publication on instal quiet isolate grind system the code require the insulate ground conductor green wire to run with the current carry conductor back to the panel box and if require back all the way to the service entrance where it be bond to the service grind water pipe or rod many of these system be instal illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe grind or a quiet grind or either the grounded conductor of a circuit often call the neutral which be refer to in the code a the identify conductor and be suppose to be white or natural grey thi conductor be suppose to be connect to grind in most electrical system at a single point generally at the service entrance panel thi connection be through the main bonding jumper in many household service panel the main bond jumper be actually a bond screw which attach the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral be generally a current carry conductor in the case of a volt circuit it be one of the two conductor complete the circuit from the panel to the load device since the ground conductor neutral be only connect to the ground conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load be any distance from the service and draw any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the ground and ground conductor at the load under normal operate condition if you should incorrectly connect the ground neutral conductor to the ground conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the ground conductor since there will now be current flow through the ground conductor it will also no longer be quite at grind potential at the load end if the load equipment ha a metal case which be connect to the ground conductor through the u grind plug the metal case be now also no longer quite at grind potential the difference under normal non short-circuit condition may be only a few tenth of a volt but it could also be a volt or two thi normally do not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the ground equipment come into contact with an independently ground object such a a water or ga pipe a radiator a metal air condition duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through thi aalternate grind path if the contact be not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong condition thi arc could start a fire it be possible in some case that the sneak grind current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size cause it to overheat with the incorrect non single-point ground of the neutral if there be a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the ground conductor which increase the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and grind the voltage on the grind system be see a noise bu computer or audio equipment often cause malfunction i have spend some hour track down such short in technical facility where they be induce severe hum into equipment the neutral be usually bond to the grind at the distribution transformer a well a at the service entrance of each dwell thi be do primarily for lightning protection so that induce lightning current have a short path back to grind and also to assure that the current draw by short to ground object like pipe draw enough current to trip circuit breaker or blow fuse quickly the bad side of thi be that not all the neutral current from the dwell go through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flow through the ground electrode water pipe etc thi may cause corrosion in the pipe and possibly in thing like underground fuel oil tank and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic field due to the large loop between the hot conductor in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and grind there be those who feel these field may be unhealthy do flame me on thi i just tell you where the field come from not it health effect a far a i concern the jury be still out on thi note that the bond jumper be only instal at the main panel not at any sub distribution panel thi be one reason why it be illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath use a a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulate conductor for the neutral the sheath can be use in thi application only a the grounding conductor if the neutral be bond to the ground conductor in the sub panel say by forget to remove the bond screw all the ground conductor of the load on that panel will be above grind with the possible problem list above the code make exception for range and dryer a well a fee from one build to another in the case of the range and dryer the neutral may be use a the equipment grind under certain condition instead of a seperate wire every time the code be revise these exception come up for review these exception be in fact the first require safety grind in the day before u grind outlet and such the appliance manufacturer do want to have to redesign their range and drier and the contractor do want to have to run fmy wire cable with fmy fairly heavy expensive wire in place of three wire to the appliance no question it would be safer with seperate neutral to the stave but the neutral current be low for most burner set since most current be in the volt hot except at some low set the wire be large gauge and there be few report case of injury or damage so far the exception have survive in the case of fee between build it primarily for lightning protection person do wire should be aware what be and what be a legal ground conductor obviously the bare wire in romex grind be anywhere there be a green wire instal such a in a portable cord that be a good ground conductor the sheath of bx clamp in bx connector in metal box be a legal ground conductor in the u bx ha an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut thi aluminum band off at the end you do have to bond it to anything it do it job by touch every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tube be generally a legal ground conductor but may require a bond locknut where it enter a box or panel particularly for larger pipe greenfield look like big bx but you pull ymy own wire in the empty sheath after you run it be not a legal ground conductor a it do have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel ha too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green ground conductor inside the greenfield wiremold be also not a legal ground conductor a the paint on the box often prevent good contact and the fee to the wiremold extension be often from a box in the wall that may not be well connect to the first wiremold box i have personally discover case where the entire run of wiremold and the case of everything plug into all the outlet on the run be hot with volt why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there wa no grind wire in the wiremold and one of the outlet have short to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a grind wire back in the wiremold from the outlet at least to the first box in the original wire conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should grind the green on gcfi outlet when ever there be a place to grind them it be legal in the nec to use them without a grind if no grind be available it be better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you do install it the interrupter do depend on the grind to trip it be desirable to connect the grind if available because if the grind be connect the interrupter will trip a soon a a faulty device be plug in wherea without the grind it will not trip until someone or something provide a grind path for those question the legal use of ungrounded gcfi read in the nec d exception thi be the code my code be in the city but i know the rule ha change it might be renumbered though we have only touch the surface concern ground there be much more to thi subject but most of you have fall asleep by now john john h schmidt internet schmidt technical director wbau phone day adelphi university evening garden city new york fax
