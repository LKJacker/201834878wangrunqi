from einarus einar indridason subject re how to the disk copy protect in kschang kuo-sheng kasey chang write in article jmiller jeff miller write in an earlier article kasey chang write nothing but if you read my whole suggestion i say that you register vium mail by mail in ymy registration card then the company send you the patch which include the info you put on the registration card the problem with thi scheme be that when i buy a game i want to play it that day mail a card to and from californium would probably take a week or more i do say the program be disabled do i i hate it when person take my word out of context i mean that once you have instal it you can not deinstall it without register it or transfer it to another machine or some sort of limitation the author will decide which will be removed when the program is registered what you ca remove it unles you register you get tum be joke right what happen if i get a demo-version of that program install it and then decide that i do like it do i have to register to be able to get rid of it hell no that be the last thing i would think of if that be what you mean then you would better make pretty sure that a statement to that effect be print loud and clear on the package a better way to implement the above mention scheme be imho to allow anyone to install the program but if they register they get some additional feature enable it could mean only one new exe file need to be copy to have get the full-version of the program of course anyone be free to delete or remove that program at whatever time they like still we face the trouble of the new exe file around that could be solve by have the user register him self and get back a specially mark for him or her a new exe file a for some sort of limitation here be some suggestion limit the size of datum that the program can work with disable save the datum print it out with some defect in the output but be sure to mark them a such let some pop-up screen appear for ca sec when the program be start exit etc but do have it that you must register to be able to remove it einarus
