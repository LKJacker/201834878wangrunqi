from ulan dale ulan subject re why circuit board be green kuusama kuusama juha vtt write not that the question be anything important but i be still curiou why be that almost all print circuit board be green i have see a few blue one but no red yellow company logo etc is there a technical reason or could it be that the market geniuse have not tought about it yet the green layer be a solder-mask and be use to make a finish board look neat and to avoid solder bridge especially when use wave solder or any other mechanize approach i see red mask but most that i see be green a bakelite board will look brown in colmy and if the solder mask be put on look like a brown board with green on either side or just one side of the board a fibreglas board will look green from the side because the green solder-mask make the board appear that colmy if you get a fibreglas board with no mask it would be a whitish-grey colmy teflon board do exist a well but i not sure about that one i gues the stuff they invent for solder mask wa green so they not about to change also any change in any chemical probably require a better than normal clean of the machine that make board a lot of company do not make their own board they ship them to a real boardhouse
