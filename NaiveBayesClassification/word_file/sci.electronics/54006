from kschang kuo-sheng kasey chang subject re how to the disk copy protect in article schaefer arno schaefer write in article ketil ketil albertsen tih write in article mblock matt block write i gues what i be say be that ymy question be difficult if not impossible to answer what exactly do you want to know do you need a good one for a project you be work on how secure must it be are you try to crack one that someone else ha use i can probably make suggestion assume the activity be strictly legal in general it be a bad idea legally to tamper with copy protection it can also lead to corruption of file which you necessarily do not have back up of be a they be copy protect which can be devestating do you have absolutely no idea for practical application and be merely curiou please clear up those question and i try to help a much a i can may we interpret thi a an offer to volunteer a editor for a copy protection faq i be quite sure that i be not alone welcome such an initiative i will volunteer to ask some of the question if you will provide the answer hey now will you stop encourage him copy protection only serve one pur pose to keep the honest buyer from make legal backup copy it will definitely not stop any pirate if you want to protect you soft supply a good documentation and support thi be imho the only way of effectively protect software there be several type of copy protection and the point be to make sure the user be use a legitimate copy the simplest and virtually fool-proof way be for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it wa instal on some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a different machine not instal from original disk will not work the program be definitely backupable if restore to the same machine depend on the programmer do use a disk drive characteristic if the user do an upgrade to the machine should reinstall all program any way no document look-up no disk wear-and-tear i do not say that the original would allow only one install the user conscience should do that i know i get flame for thi but with the increase number of casual user who either unknowingly or do care about the software copyright it the truth i have friend who ask me for copy of my latest game all the time and when i refuse they go after somebody else casual pirate be become more of a problem some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copy i see what some of my friend dig up somewhere latest and the greatest game all crack within day of actual release you know how many byte you need to change in x-wing to disable the quiz two ye two and do ask me which one they be determined pirate be unstoppable give enough time but their result do not spread that far since pirate board be not that well-known and easily track once find by authority it be the casual pirate that the copy protection be determine to discourage what i believe the company should do be implement the above plu a special patch once the user register that loudly exclaim upon bootup registered to xxxxx addres city state zip and disable the above two benefit encourage registration cut down on pirate and make it more traceable because if the patch registration message be encrypt it will be quite hard to change and therefore provide a stable trail of who allow their copy out of their hand and thu violate their license agreement thi way the legitimate user who do not register will experience minimal discomfort who do major upgrade to their computer frequently a only problem they have be they wo be able to restore to another computer the register user would have prove they be legitmate user and therefore gain full right and can restore to different machine on the other hand the software company now have a record of where thi particular copy be suppose to be if thi user copy wa find to be somewhere it wa not suppose to be we know who ha break their license agreement of course a hacker can break that eventually but that not the point be it kasey chang
