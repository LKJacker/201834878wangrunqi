from johnh john haddy subject re oscilloscope trigger in article jeroen jeroen belleman write in article david glen jacobowitz write is it just me or do anybody else out there not like digital scope my school ha david jacobowitz oh no you not the only one analogue scope give you or me at least a fair idea of what go on in a circuit digital scope seem to have a habit of invent a sizable part of it even when there be only a few sample per period my display a continuou waveform complete with non-existing overshoot i wad through lot of manual page and menu but i have find yet how to turn thi off it do show which point have actually be measure a oppose to those which have be interpolate either perhap you use the wrong brand sorry all hp fan but i have a hard time be convince that their scope match the rest of their excellent gear one of the principal function i look for when consider a dso be whether you can turn interpolation off the other important feature be to disable repetitive waveform acquisition be able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode secondly i do like menu i want to see all common function with their own button you have guess i love analogue tek scope i choose a knob with print legend over an on-screen display with up-down button right away the single knob of most digital instrument never seem to be connect to the right function at the right moment i agree with you here the only consolation be that manufacturer be begin to pay attention to ergonomic when design the menu however to be fair it seem that first time scope user my student seem to adjust to menu easier than navigate around the twenty or more knob require of a real scope last but not least you never know if the waveform display be old or recent noisy or just incoherently modulate heck you do even know if it really look the way it display digital scope only show you a tiny fraction of what go on most of the time the busy compute thing thi be one area that newer dso be address i recently evaluate the latest box from tek their which seem to be a worthy alternative to a standard analogue cro thi instrument ha a spec mean that it be alway in real time capture mode the price also match equivalent analogue scope in the range the downer be that the instrument use menu again but at least they appear to be logically lay out there be only three situation for which i would prefer a digital scope looking at what happen before the trigger look at rare event and acquire the datum to have my computer play with it let hope scope manufacturer be listen best regard jeroen belleman jeroen one more thing about the new simpler front panel these instrument tend to use digital rotary encoder a knob now thi be a vast improvement over the old oak switch the single most common cause of failure in my scope other than student blow up input be mechanical wear on these switch i look at the new panel a a great step toward increase the longevity of the instrument johnh electronic department school of mpce macquarie university sydney australium email johnh ph fax
