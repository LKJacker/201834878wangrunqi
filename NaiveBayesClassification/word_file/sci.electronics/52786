from mr smith subject voltage multiplier problem hi i just build a valve preamp and use a voltage multiplier to step the supply voltage up to approx a the load resistance increase the rc constant decrease and hence the output voltage drop i need a high an output voltage a possible about the circuit consist of seven voltage multiplier stage ie diode and capacitor each capacitor develop about acros them and i take the output from acros seven each capacitor be at if i increase each of the capacitor rat that will increase the rc constant and hence alleviate some of the problem these capacitor be go to be a little expensive a i need of them so what would happen if i connect a at capacitor in parallel with the output and hence in parallel with the seven capacitor will it a i assume increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant if it do and my output voltage become more stable by do thi then i will have kill two bird with one stone a i be experience some ripple and hence amp hum and thi new capacitor will thi out and can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor choke to be place in the output line of the power supply to filter out the main hum lowest resistance possible i not get my preamp with me at the moment because it be too much of a distraction i at university and i get to get my dissertation finish in two week hence i mail not play with my solderoing iron it be cheaper too in the long run especially if new large capacitor do work a plan email please ca alway read the net thank in advance chri name mr chri smith twang on that guitar addr uni liverpool university quest to build more and more hardware dgree computer science what ever the sun may be it be certainly not a ball of flame ga lawrence all view express be my own and reflect that of private think
