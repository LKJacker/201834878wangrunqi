from dhollman cshl subject re how to the disk copy protect i think a few thing be be miss overall here first of all anyone with a do manual can copy a disk or copy anything hide file dont go far if you be deal with anyone who be not comletely do ignorant off of a hard disk cracker aren t interest in copy disk they be programmer who get some thrill out of go through unassembly list of program to disable copy protection such a serial number dialog box volume label check and who know what when it come to computer game those person be in the minority however in my experience with the world of person and software it seem that a good majority of person say will at some point copy a friend program gee you really oughtum try thi or accept a copy these be person who normally would buy a software package or do without but decide that just once it would matter the last thing be person who own or be responsible for more than one computer most person be go to spend x of computer for the same software package they will just install it x of time especially thing like do upgrade are we have fun yet
