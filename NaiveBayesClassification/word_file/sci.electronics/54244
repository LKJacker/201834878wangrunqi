from wtm bill mayhew subject re laser v bubblejet there be a cartridge cap upgrade for older deskjet printer available from hewlett-packard older original deskjet and possibly deskjet unit may have a black plastic slide with rubber cap component in the cartrige park area on the right side view from front of the printer newer printer have a gray or white plastic slide the black plastic slide can allow ymy cartridge to dry out there wa and may still be information package with ink cartridge explain the situation hp place a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjet to the new cap mechanism i do thi on my printer and do indeed find that the cartidge now last longer i do have the information handy i suggest contact ymy nearest hp service center for information on obtain the kit hp ha upgrade kit that consist of electronic and mechanical component that vary depend on the start level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade i upgrade my original desket to a dekjet the kit wa fairly expensive you be likely better off sell ymy old printer and purchase a new deskjet now that price have decline so much upgrading an original deskjet to require a fair amount of skill but no solder upgrading a deskjet plu to a be involf swap the processor card and change a few minor part contact ymy hp service center for further information the pcl language use by deskjet be considerably different from the pcl use by laser printer especially the newer laser printer the biggest problem be dumb laser driver that send a raster end command after each scan line thi make no material difference for laser but cause the deskjet to print the accumulate raster a you might gues the result be hideously slow print the new do wordperfect print deskjet driver be still guilty of thi particular behavior from the way wordperfect work thi would not be easy to change window wordperfect work efficiently unles you use the do driver instead of window the dialect use in the laserjet iiip allow compression that permit a full page dpus image to be render with only one megabyte of memory an uncompress image could be a large a about kbyte but the printer need about of memory for it internal house-keeping laserjet iv model support band print that allow incrmental download of the image with compression in limit memory situation deskjet downloadable font be not compatible with laserjet font a single page from a laserjet only require about second thi be faster than any but the most trivial print from a deskjet printer the presumption of course be that the laser printer ha complete it warm-up cyle until ink chemistry be change wicking result in image deterioration be unavoidable i wo use the word impossible but match laser quality output from a deskjet printer be unlikely chosing an appropriate paper type help but do not eliminate the problem laser printer be more wastful of energy and consumable component hp do accept return of spend toner cartridge mitigate the material waste problem to a degree energy waste could use more work warm-up time have decrease allow stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduce in the laserjet iv kyocera produce a laser print engine that employ an amorphou silicon image drum with a replacable toner system the image drum be good for approximately copy it be a very nice print engine i wish hp use the kyocera engine kyocera also ha a neat modular paper source and stacker system the recommend duty cycle for a deskjet be significantly lower than any of hp laser printer the pick-up pressure roller be subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out the usual symptom be that the printer become reluctant to fee paper the paper fee be integrate in a transport mechanism that be a single part from hp service replacement cost for the transport be almost the fee roller be not separately replacable though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician i have disassemble and reassemble the transport on my own printer it depend upon the application which printer be best for you if you only print or page a day and be satisfy with the appearance of output the deskjet be a very good choice a note the deskjet be my choice for personal use bill mayhew neoucom computer service department rootstown oh usa phone wtm
