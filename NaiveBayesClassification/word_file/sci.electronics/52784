from jgd john de armond subject re help with ultra-long time wellison write i have a project that wa droop in my lap that be somewhat a pain to design what i be look for be a stable ultra-long solid state timer what they want to do be to place thi thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six week every two week they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different color pellet by ga pressure out acros the snow then by dig down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measure a they come to the different color pellet the problem be try to build a timer that would stand the cold degree and a power source that would drain i have look at the timer and the standard dual timer but thier temp spec wo go that low also two week equate to second per fire which mean one big time cap i have find farad ye farad cap that have a work voltage of volt and be small in size why be you fool around with analog for thi job a single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily an only cost about that and a crystal and you in busines embed the whole thing in a foam insulate blanket power it from a solar cell use the exces power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darknes if you do want to try thermal management contact someone like icl and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal it cost at most if you use a single chip micro you look at a part count of maybe a processor a crystal two cap on the crystal a power fet to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery thi be fewer part than you can build an analog timer for and be infinitely more reliable add a power zener diode for heat and a solar cell and the part count scream up to pd assembler be available for all the common single chip micro thi application be so trivial you could even look up the op code in the programmer guide and create the binary with a hex editor john john de armond interested in high performance mobility performance engineering magazine tm interested in high tech and computer mariettum ga send ur snail-mail addres to jgd perform for a free sample mag need usenet public acces in atlantum write me for info on
