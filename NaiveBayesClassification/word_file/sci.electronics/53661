from wayne alan martin subject re what do nuclear site cooling tower do excerpt from re what do nuclear site by from subject re what do nuclear site cooling tower do date frus apr pdt in article swalker write i really do know where to post thi question so i figure that thi board would be most appropriate i wa wonder about those massive concrete cylinder that be ever present at nuclear poer site they look like cylinder that have be pinch in the middle do anybody know what the actual purpose of those thing be i hear that they call tower but what the heck do they cool except for their size the cool tower on nuclear power plant be vertually identical in construction and operation to cool tower design and build in the a hundred year ago for coal fire power plant use for light and early electric railway basicly the cylindrical tower support a rapid air draft when it air be heat by hot water steam circulate thru a network of pipe that fill about the lower of the tower to assist cool and the draft water mister be add that spray cold water over the hot pipe the cold water evaporate remove the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the result water vapor be rapidly carry away by the draft thi produce the cloud frequently see rise out of these tower that slight pinch maybe of the way up the tower be there because it produce a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produce compare to a straight cylinder shape the tower be use to recondense the steam in the seal steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and use again the wider the temperature difference acros the turbine use in the power plant the more effecient they be and by recondensing the steam in the cool tower before send it back to the boiler you maintain a very wide temperature difference sometime a high a degree or more from first stage hot turbine to final stage cold turbine r tim coslet usenet technology n domesticate natural phenomenon great explaination however you leave off one detail why do you alway see them at nuclear plant but not alway at fossil fuel plant at nuclear plant it be prefer to run the water close cycle wherea fossil fuel plant can in some case get away with dump the hot water a i recall the water be a hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plant and of course there be le danger of radioactive contamination wayne martin
