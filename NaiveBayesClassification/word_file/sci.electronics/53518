from kolstad joel kolstad subject re dumb question function generator in article david glen jacobowitz write i have a new scope and i think i save a few buck by buy one with a function generator build in hmm now where wa that ad for the combination crank i saw function generator ha a offset and the amplitude too high is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve thi little problem the box would tka the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that be some low unchanging number i would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so i could just build a little buffer amp but i like to have thi box not be active sure you already get the right idea ignoring the ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second just run it into say a voltage divider make of ohm in series with ohm thi new circuit be the thevenin equivalent of one that put out of the original voltage and ha an output impedence of negligibly le than ohm you may want to monkey with the value a little depend on whether you care more about the exact divide ratio or the availability of part how that sound joel kolstad thi be why those high voltage probe for multimeter can be accurate but still cheap they have something like meg in series with which do load the often high impedence source much a well a keep the probably meg impedance multimeter happy
