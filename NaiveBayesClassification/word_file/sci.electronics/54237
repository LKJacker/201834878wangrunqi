from mcarr michael carr subject digital ac scaling being in the visualization stage of a circuit design right now i wa wonder what the best way to scale an ac voltage use an digital word be i be think of use the common method of send the word through an adc and then compare it with the ac voltage convert to a sawtooth wave to get a duty cycle however i be leary of thi method because it a require a lot of part and more importantly b create a lot of interference from the switch on the entire ac line i realize that correct filter could cancel out most of thi interference but that would require more part and boost the price further someone mention to me that they have see an ic which input bite of datum and directly scale the ac voltage come in all on-chip unfortunately he could remember the chip number or the manufacturer if anyone else ha hear of thi chip please e-mail me i be build thi project a a dimmer box for a light controller circuit and it be important that the cost of each box remain very low because one dimmer be require for each light that the user wish to control well each channel at least therefor if each box cost i doubt that an end user will want to dish out x for sixteen channel thi be something i have notice about today dimmer box they be so expensive anyway any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily do thi or info about the chip which will do it for me alway the prefer method will be greatly appreciate michael carr m-carr
