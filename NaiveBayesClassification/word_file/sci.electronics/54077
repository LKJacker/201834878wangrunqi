from rdell subject re how to the disk copy protect in article write in article noeler eric richard noel write i hate hard copy manual and would rather have all doc online not because i want to copy the program but because it usually faster and and convenient than sift through an old book i ca find just mho but i prefer hardcopy book because you can have three or fmy of them open spread acros the bed next to the desk in my dorm and reference them while use the program full-screen the window help thing come closest to good on-line documentation i see but they generally be detail enough and would probably take a large amount of space even compress which be at a premium on my system in fact the manual be the primary reason i buy borland c compiler instead of use the one the lab license in the lab of course i get a shelf full of book to help me out when i stick to each hi own agree personally i can not flip from page to page on a screen and retain information a easily a in the write page off deeper end why do everyone think they need to be able to make a backup copy almost all new software must be instal to the hard disk so you be leave with the original a ymy backup i think it a waste of time space and money a well a it make it to tempt to lend out the backup we destroy about six set of original microsoft word for mac and word for window may have be a bad batch of disk do have the faintest idea what happen to them they just go bad were store near any magnetic field or otherwise mistreat indeed they be only use once given thi and the massive headach find a work set of disk to fix some of the machine that periodically go down i say have work backup be a godsend i sure wish we have them sometime i think murphy law hold true more often than newton when we need them i think it sortof like snake antivenin of the time you have absolutely no use for it but when you need it boy do you ever need it ditto in fact at work where thing be dead if the backup be no good i insist on have at least a level backup system it seem that whenever you have good backup you never need them but if you do have them murphy guarantee that you suffer for it i do have backup of my original at home but then my machine do see anywhere near the of these here at the lab and so i consider it le of a risk still i usually make work copy of them when i install them and then eventually re-use these work copy for something else no flame intend just my think just mine too and mine of course richard dell
