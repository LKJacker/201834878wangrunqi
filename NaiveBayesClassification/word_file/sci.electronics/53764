from kubovich mark w kubovich subject common-mode noise and small signal i have never work with really small signal before and have a few question about low level noise i have notice that the waveform synthesizer that i be use analogic ha some relatively large common mode noise on it i be use thi synthesizer to out another transient waveform and be amplify the difference several hundred time the ha about mvp-p of common mode noise and thi tend to make my measurement hard to repeat the noise be not quite in sync with line frequency and on a spectrum analyzer the main component be about how can i get rid of the noise when i look at the spectrum use an hp audio range analyzer the noise go away the minute i switch to on the input i be guess the anlayzer ha a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to dc also if i use a differential amplifier ia to solve the problem how important be it to use one of these driver an amp connect to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble cause by different cable capacitance if anyone can suggest a good ic ia for use with transient signal with content from to about i would appreciate it
