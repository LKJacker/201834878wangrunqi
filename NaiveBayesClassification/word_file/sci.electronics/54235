subject re how to the disk copy protect from sjmadsen steve madsen kuo-sheng kasey chang kschang write in article sjmadsen steve madsen write thi be not a good idea i upgrade my motherboard last fall i would have be quite piss at any software that would have force me to reinstall simply because i change motherboard opinion be understandable i assume you have a tape drive not all of u have about floppy around for backup you know actually no i do have a tape drive in the event of a total hard disk failure i reinstall the app from original and restore the datum from the backup i keep of that with upward of of stuff on my hard disk there be no way i go to try and back it all up without a tape drive would be nice to have one though ram be something you add all the time so no it more like bio manufacturer processor type datum can not be use esp with these new flash rom bio machine with update on a diskette maybe maybe not today it do happen a often i would hope but then if a bio be buggy and the user get an upgrade the bio information be go to change at least the date anyway tagging the bio manufacturer be still go to falsely tag those user who upgrade the motherboard thi type of upgrade do require a hard disk on the other hand to make thi les intrusive it could be disguise a please insert original disk xx a i need file yyyyyy for update it would be perfectly reasonable sort of a long a it wa do too terribly often otherwise i think it would get annoy and the user would go look for other software thi be silly it much easier to loan disk to a friend and let them do an install than to backup ymy copy already on disk and then give them that ymy scheme be go to stop anyone of course it be easier are you say then the original should allow only one install what be ymy point of course not if something get corrupt and my app need to be reinstall the worst thing i want that software tell me be thi software ha already be register to blank and it be against the law to install it on other machine or something similar acces for window do thi and it only require a click on ok to go away pretty non-intrusive but it get the point acros what i say wa the program should have certain restriction such a the restrict-to-one-machine until the program be register with the manufacturer the manufacturer will then supply the then-proven-legitimate-user with a patch that will disable the restriction and proudly proclaim the legal copy with the registered to xxx screen thi be a great idea i like the key system that some shareware product use the only problem be that it will be difficult for big software company to implement thi without it get very cost-ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the user steve madsen sjmadsen ask me about linux the free unix
