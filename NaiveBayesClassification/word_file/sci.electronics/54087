from gfl lenahan grant f subject re adcom cheap product much delete about assembly in usa v other i wish to focu on the subject of warm-running amplifier sure the amp run very fairly hot but that how you get an amp to sound incredibly good an amp that run hot ha no bear on how it gon na sound the amp you have probably be run class-a the whole day because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp want to skimp on heatsinking or cool to save cost hmmmmm there be a correclation between warm-running amp and good sound or in ymy word it do have a bear on now i do suggest that everyone run out and create combination that will degrade lifespan but a cold-running circuit be much more suceptible to temperature variation with varrying current than be a warm-running one and since junction resistance be a function of temperature thi ha a detrimental effect on linearity a few fact bia point vary with temperature junction resist varrie with temp adcom product do not run class-a if you still do beleive thi assertion consider the warm-up requirement for most good test equipment or better yet just listen to an amplifier warm-up on many design it quite audible on mine about minute for the output stage many hour for the driver fortunately the driver be not switch in any experiment or when draw conclusion from listen betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bia idle current level both have a positive correlation with low distortion and good sound quality and high bia result in warmer operation all other factor be equal grant
