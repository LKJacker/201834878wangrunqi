from idh ian hawkin subject making up odd resistor value require by filter when construct active filter odd value of resistor be often require something like a k ohm resistor it seem best to choose common capacitor value and cope with the strange resistance then demand is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance give fix resistor of the standard value per decade etc it be a common enough problem yet i cant recall see a program that tell that gife rq start with q and find prefer value x y and z cheer ian h
