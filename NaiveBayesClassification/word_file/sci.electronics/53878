from kolstad joel kolstad subject re how to the disk copy protect in article seharus babak seharus write i have write a program and i want to market it i would like certain degree of protection since my main custmer be individual and not the cooperation i know laser hole burn method and hardware key method however my software be go to cost only so i can not afford that also at thi low price i can not afford person make too many copy of my software well i gues say upto illigal copy be ok by me however i do not want someone to get a copy of pctool and copy my software off course i never mean to forbid the true hacker from copy since they can develope a better program anyway i would bother with the copy protection if i be you if you program be any good the pirate will have strip the protection and will be distribute the strip version be well under a week hardware method prevent j random loser from use hi copy ius pc to pirate ymy software but do stop anyone who know a few person with enough connection to real pirate who will be able to defeat ymy check for the hole code you may want to price ymy software depend on what it be a tad higher a price change from to probably would turn off very few potential buyer and that way you could tolerate more pirate whose number do change with the price a for the pirate figure ha ha of course a lot of pirate just have thi thing about have pirate software even if they never use it so perhap that really would count toward even so be awfully low joel kolstad i assume you talk pc software if you talk unix or something else somewhat obscure copy protection might be a slightly more viable alternative
