from mark underwood subject re how to the disk copy protect in article kschang kuo-sheng kasey chang write there be several type of copy protection and the point be to make sure the user be use a legitimate copy the simplest and virtually fool-proof way be for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it wa instal on some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a different machine not instal from original disk will not work okay so what do you do if some part of the machine presumably the part on which the code number or whatever that the program ha fixate itself upon go bad you replace that part and now ymy program wo run because it on a different computer thi be of course assume that the program use something in rom like the bio serial number maybe and not a disk-based code number obviously if the drive go bad you be reinstall the stuff anyway i work in a computer lab which be part of the university microlab system we have the wonderfully fun task of maintain well over a hundred machine both pc and macintosh a well a administer a network of over next machine i personally be concern only with a small lab with ten pc and ten mac i not the manager but help him with admin often imho copy-protection scheme of any sort be nothing more than a major headache for the legitimate user anyone who want a copy of ymy program and do care about legality will get a copy period pirate board or no pirate board i too have friend who blatantly and quite successfuly hack copy protection scheme practically in their sleep let consider what go on in my lab almost daily we have at least one machine down sometime several due to some goofball screw up some set or other on a piece of software admittedly we be student mostly be not the world most efficient and effective network administrator but we try keeping even the twenty machine that be partly my responsibility even vaguely look and act similar to the average user and maintain behind-the-scene consistency be a real headache but not so bad a headache a try to remember twenty different folder location of norton utility when some guy trash hi disk often we have hardware problem at peak busines time and have to do some parts-swapping to get stuff work temporarily well i cut to the chase and quit bore the point be often we have to re-install software and copy configuration file etc from machine to machine by far the easiest way we have find to do thi be to get one machine work exactly the way we want to then copy the complete setup of thi machine to the other nine of that machine type thi ensure u that for at least ten minute we have ten identical machine to work with having them network simplify thi considerably a my major package wordperfect window etc be all network version and thu only one copy to me with often however we need to install a package request by some instructor to one some or all of the machine for a special project thi be usually a hand-written or shareware etc program similar to what i believe the original poster wa ask about the few we have have with copy protection scheme have cause nothing but nightmare for u to maintain in short do waste ymy time with a copy protection scheme it sort of like outlaw gun the criminal will get ymy program anyway and you will only be hurt the legitimate honest user write a good user guide and tech manual whatever else for ymy program please do thi regardles of whether you copy protect the thing and only distribute the manual to licensed user jack the price to cut ymy loss but please take a cue from the major company who can admittedly afford the cost of illegal copy far better than you and do burden the legitimate user with a copy protection scheme sorry for the tirade but it be a long day here mark s underwood ee student university of kentucky lab assistant boyd hall microlab a tiny little division of uk library microlab e-mail the program be definitely backupable if restore to the same machine depend on the programmer do use a disk drive characteristic if the user do an upgrade to the machine should reinstall all program any way no document look-up no disk wear-and-tear i do not say that the original would allow only one install the user conscience should do that i know i get flame for thi but with the increase number of casual user who either unknowingly or do care about the software copyright it the truth i have friend who ask me for copy of my latest game all the time and when i refuse they go after somebody else casual pirate be become more of a problem some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copy i see what some of my friend dig up somewhere latest and the greatest game all crack within day of actual release you know how many byte you need to change in x-wing to disable the quiz two ye two and do ask me which one they be determined pirate be unstoppable give enough time but their result do not spread that far since pirate board be not that well-known and easily track once find by authority it be the casual pirate that the copy protection be determine to discourage what i believe the company should do be implement the above plu a special patch once the user register that loudly exclaim upon bootup registered to xxxxx addres city state zip and disable the above two benefit encourage registration cut down on pirate and make it more traceable because if the patch registration message be encrypt it will be quite hard to change and therefore provide a stable trail of who allow their copy out of their hand and thu violate their license agreement thi way the legitimate user who do not register will experience minimal discomfort who do major upgrade to their computer frequently a only problem they have be they wo be able to restore to another computer the register user would have prove they be legitmate user and therefore gain full right and can restore to different machine on the other hand the software company now have a record of where thi particular copy be suppose to be if thi user copy wa find to be somewhere it wa not suppose to be we know who ha break their license agreement of course a hacker can break that eventually but that not the point be it kasey chang
