from edhall ed hall subject re building a uv flashlight in article jhawk john hawkinson write one other thing a friend of mine mention something about near-uv light be cheaper to get at than actual uv light do anyone know what he wa refer to i do want to get into a semantic argument but contrary to some other post near uv light be actual uv light the near mean that it be close to the visible spectrum of relatively long wavelength not that it be nearly uv i sure you can figure out now just what far uv be regular incandenscent flashlight bulb emit tiny amount of uv in the near end of the spectrum such that a filter can be use to remove the visible light and thu create a weak uv source stronger source be go to require ga probably mercury vapor discharge tube such a fluorescent tube with uv phosphor be careful though strong uv source can cause physiological damage especially to the eye the shorter wavelength be the most dangerou it would project a beam like a flashlight but replace the tube in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tube would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source it would be bright enough to be useful but not dangerously so ed hall edhall
