from cyberman cyberman subject re analog michael fulbright say analog to all on mf i be try to build a synchronou demodulator and i hit a snag mf in my application i want to be able to change the gain of an mf op amp amplifier from to controlable vium a digital input mf the most obviou way i come up with be to use analog switch mf to adjust the gain of the op amp the only analog switch i have mf experience with it the unfortunately i want to switch an mf ac signal which go from about to and the be only mf for positive signal how about use a it ha a seperate grind for the analog output it would get you bite mf another part which catch my eye wa the analog device thi mf be a balance demodulator which appear to fill exactly the need i mf have the datum sheet wa somewhat skimpy on application note could mf someone comment on use thi chip for the follow application or how about a multiply convertor thi be essentiallty what you be make stephen cyberman mangled on frus at catch the blue wave blue
