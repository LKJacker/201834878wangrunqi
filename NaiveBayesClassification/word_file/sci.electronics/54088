from dtmedin dave medin subject re suggestion on audio relay in article billq billy quinn write i build a little project use the radio shack relay to switch audio i get pretty bad when the thing switch i wa do most of the common thing one be suppose to do when use relay and nothing seem to get rid of the click my question be is there a good circuit that i can use for switch audio so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio line i will appreciate any advice or reference to advice also exact part name etc for the relay will help the first step be to make sure that there be no dc component intentional or not on the audio line to be switch if neither the output or input present an unintentional dc level let say they capacitively couple then put a k resistor from each input to grind and from the output to grind be a good precaution against leakage in any couple cap present a dc level that be guaranteed to cause a click if the device present an unintentional dc level that be from more than just couple capacitor leakage then you need to remove the dc before switch with couple capacitor of ymy own if you have more than one relay each relay switch one input through to a common output you can use make-before-break switch where for a brief instant both source be connect during a switch change thi may mask the switch click an audio switch that be clickles be make by take a light bulb and make ymy own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor ldr seal inside a piece of black heatshrink many broadcast console use thi older but time-honored technique claro actually make a complete optisolator like thi but i do have a part number handy radio shack ha a ldr grab-bag you might want to try for a simple solid state clickles switch that be cheap you might try look at the analog switch that be commonly available or it older predecessor the again the dc component must be remove prior to switch other alternative include jfet switch both discrete and ic and diode switch which work relatively well surprisingly all the above with their pitfall and application tip could easily make a subject for a multi-page article solid state switch may induce a click of their own when turn on due to charge be inject into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal change state technique to minimize thi include lower the impedance of the signal path through the switch differential switch and slow the risetime of the control pulse with the cut the click can be a simple a put resistor in series with the control pin hope thi help at least get you start dave medin phone w ssd networking h intergraph corp internet dtmedin huntsville al uucp uunet ingr catbyte dtmedin everywhere you look at least around my office the opinion express here be mine or those of my machine
