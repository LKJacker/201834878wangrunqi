from henry henry spencer subject re a moisture repellant wa lead acid battery concrete in article myer bob myer write it be the average temperature that be the key factor here but rather which be better at transfer the heat out of the presumably warmer than grind temperature battery uh bob why be the battery warmer than grind temperature on the time scale in question and with the considerably reduce temperature swing several foot underground there be go to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what it sit on question why do a concrete floor feel cooler than the surround dirt when you place ymy hand on it because the temperature of ymy hand unlike that of the battery be determine by the balance between internal heat production and external heat los you feel the greater rate of heat los from an object ymy hand which be keep much warmer than it surround in the case of an object with no significant internal heat production thi will affect how quickly it come into equilibrium with it surround if it start out not in equilibrium with them but wo affect the final temperature for the same reason windchill affect whether you will freeze but not whether water will freeze resemble a high-speed collision henry spencer u of toronto zoology between and suno dick dunn henry utzoo henry
