from oxreid subject re radar detector detector in ragee randy agee write so the question be what do the radar detector detector actually detect would additional shield stray rf generate by a radar detector or be the rf actually be emit by the detector antenna are any brand quieter than other ok so ymy a ham well tune in or these number sound like some you have herd before that right you guess it they be common if number every super-het receiver ha a local oscillator s which generate an if thi be what ymy detector detector be detect the local oscillator some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more way to receiver you if you want to receiver something at say you must generate a local oscillator signal of ymy local osc frequency thi if be then feed into a normal agc ckt the detector be key uppon the agc voltage ymy mileage may vary since the agc be a negative fee back device a positive voltage set off a i think you get the picture
