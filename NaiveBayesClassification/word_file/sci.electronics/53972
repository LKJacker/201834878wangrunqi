from mcmahan dave mc mahan subject re oversampling cd player in a previou article kolstad joel kolstad write in article hcb h c bowman write i just buy a new portable cd player for the office and i notice that it proudly proclaim time oversampling on the box now while i think i understand what oversampling be the rate of discrete sample exceed the highest frequency component of interest by some factor i do understand thi time busines it seem to me that when i buy my first cd player wa it really year ago the spec say time could someone please tell me whether i get senile if i not then what good do it do for the player to take sample at a higher rate the datum be only ever read once bar mistrack and such of course and eventually get turn into khz bite two channel datum oversampling take two discrete datum point and interpolate point between them for n time oversampling when i ask person say that the interpolation wa not simply linear interpolation but significantly more complicate you be quite correct in ymy understand the filter be not interpolation a that would distort the frequency content of the signal you be listen to generally these player run the sample thru an all-pas filter network i have do thi for ecg waveform from a person heart and the effect be rather spooky it actually reconstruct peak that be there correctly too and fill in the gap with the properly compute value just a if there have be a real sample take at that point i use a cpu to do all the math it take a decent but not unreasonable amount of cpu time to do thi you can keep up with thing in realtime if you write efficient code in case you care the filter method use an fir finite impulse response filter i gues that cd maker use the same kind of method anybody out there know the real answer i say that they use a tap delay line with weight to accomplish the filter thi strike me a the most cost effective method for volume production run anyway then the purpose of oversampling be to move the effective sample rate up to n time khz in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filter for the same quality filter higher oversampling let you build cheaper filter wherea for the same price filter higher oversampling let you build better filter so assume the quality of all other component in a cd player remain the same oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to anti-alia filter actually i think the only reason they do thi be so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic i would gues that it be acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not you can use sloppier component and give the filter a roll-off that be so sharp it too bad that they charge more for something that i think be actually le costly to build i seriously doubt that the filter cost the same but be better they be build to a price spec and that spec say cheap a possible joel kolstad dave dave mcmahan mcmahan
