from wiegand robert wiegand subject re lead acid battery concrete carter ame write i wa just wonder one thing actually two i hope that thi be the proper place to post thi subject why do a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when store on a concrete floor i decide to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage thi year to preserve them and i just go to use them and notice that not only do they not work but they act like the two terminal be short i ask a friend and he say that you should never do that it ruin them but he could tell me why i do see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the battery however you would have be better off leave them outside keeping them cold would have be better for them than bring them inside a warm battery will self-discharge faster than a cold one when you be store a battery it a good idea to charge it once a month letting a battery go completely dead be bad for it i suspect thi be what cause ymy problem robert wiegand motorola inc wiegand disclamer i do do it i wa somewhere else at the time
