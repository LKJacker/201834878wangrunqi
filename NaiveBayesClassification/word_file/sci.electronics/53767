from jkaidor jerome kaidor subject re electronic odometer wa used bmw qu just a few comment about the feasability of zip up a bunch of mile on ymy electronic odometer with an oscillator i would expect to be able to do thi not because the engineer at bmw be put in anti-fraud logic but just because an automobile be a noisy hostile environment for electronic and i would expect the software to be conservative if i be to design a microprocessor-based program it would have the follow feature just off the top of my head is thi a real pulse or just a glitch smoothing the rate-of-change of speed can not be too high thi be a car not an electron top speed limit anything above be ridiculou must be electrical noise or contact bounce a for get in and presetting the pin if thi be the circuit board out of a bmw dashboard i seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pin in the middle of the card good luck get at the counter i would expect a high input frequency to damage the meter remember it probably damp so it ca move too fast and be probably protect after all a car be an extremely hostile place for delicate electronic there use to be an app note in the national semiconductor linear databook that go into thi in good detail jerry kaidor jerry jkaidor jerry kaidor
