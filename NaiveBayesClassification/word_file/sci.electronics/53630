from alung aaron lung subject re adcom cheap product in article webb webber ah write stuff delete i wa also sceptical about the amp be build in the far-east or where-ever but if you look in the amp and see what component they use and how it wa design you can easily see why the amplifier sound so brilliant good point also i would be surprise that the component they use off-shore be of inferior quality a long a it wa properly design and robust premium component be use it should matter where it be assemble i can not see why person say the amplifier wo last not with those quality component inside sure the amp run very fairly hot but that how you get an amp to sound incredibly good an amp that run hot ha no bear on how it gon na sound the amp you have probably be run class-a the whole day actually i be wary of excessively hot amp even though the component inside may be rat to run that way excessive heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component regardles of quality in fact an amp that do run hot to the touch be because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp want to skimp on heatsinking or cool to save cost hmmmmm aaron
