from alung aaron lung subject re ic package in article seema seema varma write hi i be look for some help in choose a package for a high-speed silicon adc currently be fabricate thi be a phd research project and i have to test the chip at speed on a pcb i expect to have roughly package circuit and will do dc low-speed and high-speed test use different set-up for the test chip i know for sure that a dip will not work the long lead line have too high an inductance getting a custom-made package be too expensive so i be try to choose between a flatpak and a leadles chip carrier the flatpack would be hard to test since it ha to be solder on to the test setup and i would spend load of time solder a i keep change the test chip the leadles chip carrier socket also have long lead line and may not work at high speed do anyone out there have of thi field i would greatly appreciate help any idea name of company manufacture would help the multi-layer fancy gaa package seem like a bite of overkill seema varma you do mention whether or not cost be an issue where exactly be you run the digital side ttl ecl we run and all over my ic test equipment all day long in the ecl domain and we use dip along with plcc and pitch qfp to name a few i do see a problem in package a long a you adhere to sound engineer practice a good source of information be motorola mecl system design handbook the latest ed be date that be consider to be one of the bible in high-speed design the very fact that you need to build a test fixture mean you most likely go to need a socket it in itself ha far more inductance per pin than the package you be test not to mention any impedance discontinuity i do see the big concern over the package because it probably be go to make that much difference if you try to get ttl to run at have fun ttl wa never design to run in a environment aaron my opinion have nothing to do with my company the standard disclaimer apply
