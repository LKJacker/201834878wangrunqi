from subject level brightnes xma light set for easter ye i know it nowhere near christma time but i gon na loose net acces in a few day maybe a week or if i lucky and want to post thi for interest person to save xma note bell lab be a good place if you have a phd and a good bos i have neither subject xma light set with level of brightnes another version of a variable brightnes xma light set thi set start with a blinker bulb string diagram orginal way set b b modify set for level brightnes string string b rtn note no mod to wire to the right of thi point only one blinker be use note that the blinker would not have a much current thru it a the string bulb because of the second string of bulb in parallel with it that why the use of the resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunt thru the second string while the blinker be glow and the second string be not glow when the blinker go open thi resistor ha only a slight effect on the brightnes of the string slightly dimmer slightly brighter or use a bulb in place of the resistor if you can get one caution do not replace with a standard bulb a these draw too much current and burn out the blinker approx what you see when it work powerup string will light at full brightnes and b will be light bypass most of the current from the second string make them not light b will open place both string in series make the string that wa out to glow at a low brightnes and the other string that wa on before to glow at reduce brightnes be sure to wire and insulate the splice resistor lead and cut wire in a safe manner
