from mamishev alexander valentino subject digital voltmeter how do it work hello let me introduce a problem when i measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter use ac mode my output be an rm value a peak value over square right when i measure a square wave in the same mode ac my output be equal to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave i assume that a digital voltmeter make some kind of integration of the input value and divide it over the wave period right now i use it to measure the same square wave a above but distort by high-frequency harmonic ideally output should be the same but the output value wa only about of the previou one why what be the nature of thi output value what do the voltmeter actually measure and what do it show related question le important to me what be advantage and disadvantage of digital voltmeter to compare with analog one thank you for ymy attention you could mail me ymy opinion at or open a discussion here i would appreciate either way alexander v mamishev power system automation laboratory phone office department of electrical engineering phone home texa a m university fax college station tx usa internet
