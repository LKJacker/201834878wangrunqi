from wagner tom wagner wizzard of old equipment nanaimo campu subject re suggestion on audio relay in article alung aaron lung write in article billq billy quinn write i build a little project use the radio shack relay to switch audio i get pretty bad when the thing switch i wa do most of the common thing one be suppose to do when use relay and nothing seem to get rid of the click my question be is there a good circuit that i can use for switch audio so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio line i will appreciate any advice or reference to advice also exact part name etc for the relay will help are you switch high level signal or low level signal like pre-amp out level signal also be the click you mention the big clack that happen when it switch or be you refer to contact bounce how be you drive the relay ttl gate output switching transistor how be the relay connect to what you be drive need more specific to answer ymy question a a general rule no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contact the noise you hear be due to the momentary open and close of the path the noiseles way of transfer audio be to grind the circuit in high impedance audio circuit a resistive t be construct close to characteristic impedance of the circuit grounding the imput connect to the t transfer the audio in low impedance circuit transformer be usually use and the input be short out or ground secondary be parallel at the characteristic impedance sometime if it be necessary to actually switch audio a second contact be use to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switch time telephone relay be handy because contact can be adjust to make before break and vica versa but i have see any of these for year nowady switch be do electronically with op amp etc a novel circuit i use to build wa a primitive optical isolator it consist of a resistive photocell and a lamp all package in a tube when the lamp be off the cell be high resistance turn the lamp on and the resistance lower pass the audio once again thi device in a t switch the audio varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control use variable resister and you have a mixer lot of luck tom tom wagner audio visual technician malaspina college nanaimo british columbium loc callsign weapon kentucky rifle snail mail to site rr nanaimo british columbium canada i do not recyle i keep everything all standard disclaimer apply
