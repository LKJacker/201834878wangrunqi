from warren warren gaiewski subject re d g h type amplifier in article mark yeck write hey can someone clue me in on these and other weird type of amplifier just a brief intro to the concept behind these would be cool i have the clue on type a b and ab already and stuff but these other one be mention occasionally and i dont know what they do i think type d be like a pwm scheme or something thanx in advance the whole point to these weird amplifier type be improve efficiency clas d amp be pwm pulse width modulation amp which work very much like switch power supply i think i see these thing call clas s before a well they capable of very high efficiency and would be suitable for very high power i yet to see anything like thi use in an audiophile amp though i be try to design a three-kilowatter for the last year to be use a an inverter for an up but have be have seriou problem with layout parasitic irf in parallel any help with a do-able isolate drive ckt would be appreciate i not absolutely positive about thi but i beleive a g amp be one that operate off a variable or switch power supply rail voltage the carver amp do something like thi they use some sort of phase-control circuit i do not fully understand it operation to reduce the transformer size and i beleive that be patent i have an apart try to fix and find that it have three rail voltage that it switch between i run a simulation on pspice and find that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation heat under large-signal condition or when drive reactive load which draw high current at the zero-voltage cross think speaker dr diode great sound start with warren the source warren
