from dtmedin dave medin subject re oscilloscope trigger in article david glen jacobowitz write can someone out there explain exactly what the feature find on oscilloscope do lot og good explanation delete lot more delete is it just me or do anybody else out there not like digital scope my school ha some beauutful hp that be digital with all the bell and whistle include soft-key which i think be a loveley touch that be software key you do forget that you be deal with a computer those scope even with all their neatnes still make the ickyest look wave lotsa feature but ugly output and those be the best digital i have ever see i see a lot of cheaper digital and they look terrible i think the hangup with digital scope be that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basi and some of the function be typically present in my opinion in a counter-intuitive fashion hp ha make some stride in their series imo automatic setup be fine for simple repetitive waveform but can give you some crazy result on more complex event where you need to understand how the scope be actually the event for example be the scope in equivalent time or in real time sample mode equivalent time be a mode where sample be built-up slowly by add a delay to the trigger event each sweep what wa the scope actual sample rate at the time how be the datum be massage after capture but before display etc one common misconception be the speed of the scope is the hp scope you use really a mhz scope or be it a mhz sample rate scope mhz single shoot significance whose front end include can support mhz waveform important for equivalent time sample the mhz input in thi case really only help you when ymy waveform be repetitive or on a single sample when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time so there be a lot more variable in understand how to get useful information from a digital scope i prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for event where i need storage for later analysi or comparison when the event be within the capability of the scope now for the price of true mhz digital scope to fall dave medin phone w ssd networking h intergraph corp internet dtmedin huntsville al uucp uunet ingr catbyte dtmedin everywhere you look at least around my office the opinion express here be mine or those of my machine
