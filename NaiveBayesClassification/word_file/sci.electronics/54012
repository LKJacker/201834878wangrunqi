from johne john eaton subject re can radio freq be used to measure distance robert g carpenter write i wonder if it possible to use radio wave to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver seem to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance thi would be for short distance ft and i would need to have accuracy of inch or so you might try look at what available in laser locate system they work best for close work mile and under rf be use for much longer distance in two major mode transponder and phase measurment transponder require you send a pulse to another station and it return it to you and you measure the round trip time minu the receiver time phase measurement require two or more transmit station send the same frequency signal multiplexed in time a receiver can pick them up and measure the phase shift between signal map can be draw that plot the line of position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two station john eaton hp-vcd johne
