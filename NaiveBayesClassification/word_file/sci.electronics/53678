from iisakkil mika iisakkila subject re what to do with old simm rubin daniel j rubin write how hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular motorola microcontroller not hard you can do the refresh and acces cycle by software but thi hog most of the available cpu cycle on a low-end controller i see some application note from philip that use one of their derivative a a printer buffer with up to of dynamic ram that wa access and refresh with software bit-banging another alternative would be to use one of those nice dram controller chip that create static ram appearance and all that but they may be too expensive to make it worthwhile segmented memory help structure software
