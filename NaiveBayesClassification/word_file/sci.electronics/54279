from vanderby david vanderbyl subject re lead acid battery part the lead-acid secondary cell release energy electricity with the follow chemical reaction pb lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water heat of formation delete the heat of reaction at c be therefore kcal per mole produce note that lead sulfate be not very soluble gram per gram water at c and it will thu precipitate out of solution where the reaction be occur or the cathode positive terminal of the battery i be almost sure it be the positive terminal where the precipitate form but i may be wrong oh well i do have a corrode battery to corrobate and i do feel like think through it right now the major problem with thi be that the reaction take place in an acid solution be soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out also be in a water solution a and thu the heat of formation of and be for the most part irrelevant what be important to notice here be that the reaction a you know it would be be exothermic or energy discharge a it turn out the reaction be indeed exothermic heat produce more about thi later what actually happen to make the battery completely useles be thi we talk lead-acid battery of course the battery slowly self discharge a thi discharge take place two thing happen the level of pb ion in the acid solution increase the lead and lead oxide plate be dissolve the level of ion in the acid solution decrease the solution become le acidic or more like water if you like now a the post to which i be respond correctly state will precipitate in a water non-acid solution when the battery dy be fully discharge we end up with a high concentration of pb and in water so form in the solution and fall to the bottom of the battery of course thi happen in vary degree the more discharge the more precipitate form the precipitate form a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery if there be enough of the lead and lead oxide plate leave to touch the precipitate more common in a newer battery a dead short result i have see product in automotive shop to correct thi condition but they be for the most part useles they can dissolve the but can not restore the lead and lead oxide plate properly you may have some succes with these product for a newer battery stuff delete to understand why lead-acid battery do indeed discharge faster when store on concrete a oppose to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechatelier principle which can be paraphrase a anything subject to some stres will act to move to a more comfortable position here be the thermal conductivity of a some select material stuff delete thi be where lechatelier principle come into play removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion if the reaction normally occur at room temperature keep the battery at that temperature require the removal of any heat produce a concrete surface be a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface store a battery in the corner of a pour concrete basement and you have surface remove energy which pull the reaction along thi stuff be just make up by the author and be completely invalid in fact the discharge reaction take place at a higher rate at higher temperature a logical consequence of the above argument be thi if you really want ymy car to start lower the battery temperature to to the reaction along we all know from experience at least those of u in canada do it get cold up here that thi be not true if we want to start my car on a really cold day we warm the battery beside which there be not enough energy release through self discharge to appreciably raise the temperature the air would amply dissipate any such heat whether the bottom of the battery wa insulate or not thi be of course irrelevant since you would want the battery to be cool during storage just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charge
