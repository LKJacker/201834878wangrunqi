from john john west subject re atarus processor ifarqhar ian farquhar write in article squish shishin yamada write the atarus use a cpu just like their entire line computer a well a the game machine wrong it ha a for those who would like to know the wa a without irq or nmi and with only addres line give memory space it have one custome chip not an asic in the sense that word be now understand the tium sometime know a the although most other manufacturer list that a the cium complex interface adapter tium stand for television interface adapter and it handle sound paddle and the minimal video hardware the possess did know about it be call the that the cium find in the commodore i do believe thi chip exist when the wa around the tium wa map into the bottom byte of page and shadow in the bottom byte of page to get an image on the screen you have to wait until the raster line ymy picture start at load bitmap for thi line into the register tell them what x position to take how many duplicate you want etc then do it all again for the next line thi take all of the processor time during the visible portion of the display there wa also a standard ram timer riot plu a voltage regulator and if memory serve a timer that all the ram wa map into the top byte of page and shadow in page the ha a zero-page address mode on most instruction that be both shorter and faster than the normal one so it be important on a machine like thi to have the scratchpad ram in page unfortunately it also want it stack to be in page the stack pointer be bite and the high byte of the addres be hardwired to the iot section wa map into page somewhere bite register ca remember if each bite could be independantly set to i or o like the and and bite timer with a programmable prescaler i think thi wa some power of there be no interrupt in the system so many game would set up the timer at some know time go away and do something else for a while then sit and wait for the timer to run down there wa no logic in the box to do addres decode the riot have at least chip select pin probably one active high one active low and i imagine the tium wa much the same variou addres line be feed directly to chip select the like to have rom right at the top of memory so the have to use rom with active high chip select not exactly normal so some cartrige have a in them to convert thi to the more usual active low chip select john west
