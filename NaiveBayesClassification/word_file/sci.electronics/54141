from ejajko edward jajko subject re how to the disk copy protect in article noeler eric richard noel write i strongly disagree i think most pirate be do by amateur who wo copy the program if diskcopy ca do it i hate to disagree but i will note i do pirate software nor do i trade it i simply have meet and talk extensively with those who have that it the fbi can tap someone else phone most pirate be do by person who do use the program they pirate a crack program tend to get pass on resplendant in the variou graphic and animation that advertise whoever perform the modification s i admit that a large portion of the busines world be involve in copy of program to one fellow worker maybe take it home for use on one own pc but such trade tend to be interdepartmental or at most spread throughout the busines a a whole how many time have you have someone walk from busines to busines let person copy disk it mostly a matter of convenience a person see a program they want to use and they feel justify in make a copy since someone already pay for it etc etc a note thi be start to change a bite not much though if you talk a max goal of pirate copy i bet that anything that will beat diskcopy and ca be easily copy from a hard drive will suffice what about commercially available copy program copyius how about program like teledisk that can do thing diskcopy ca and before anyone dispute thi because they feel that those who would copy would know about thi after work with person around computer one come to realize that the user do know much any computer enthusiast be at least better at pre-guessing command and how to use them can you sit down and use something without read the manual and it be these person who be do the pirate not joe window user who ca remember a few argument to the dir command i hate hard copy manual and would rather have all doc online not because i want to copy the program but because it usually faster and and convenient than sift through an old book i ca find really i find it even out the online stuff can be read through faster but you stick read it in linear flow start to finish unles you jump ahead with a search or such a book though you can flip through faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty index too but i partially agree i often wish i could grep something that wa write down off deeper end why do everyone think they need to be able to make a backup copy almost all new software must be instal to the hard disk so you be leave with the original a ymy backup i think it a waste of time space and money a well a it make it to tempt to lend out the backup what if they need to re-install the idea of a backup still hold if the original disk go bad they out of luck for about week which be the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disk if they do it without a charge edward w jajko the nekomancer ejajko mein fuhrer i can walk doctor strangelove
