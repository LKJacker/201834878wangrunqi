from plumpe david plumpe subject re making up odd resistor value require by filter in idh ian hawkin write when construct active filter odd value of resistor be often require something like a k ohm resistor it seem best to choose common capacitor value and cope with the strange resistance then demand is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance give fix resistor of the standard value per decade etc it be a common enough problem yet i cant recall see a program that tell that gife rq start with q and find prefer value x y and z since you worry about the third decimal place i assume you use tolerance resistor and capacitor
