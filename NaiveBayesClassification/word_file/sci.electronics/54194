from dpierce richard d pierce subject re pink noise in article david sharpe write pink noise and white noise be equal amount of all frequency thi be in most case around the hz range be use to adjust for room dynamic and stuff like that there be a few eq out on the market that have pink noise build in most all from audio control have them i know the do wrong wrong completely wrong and a little mislead too white noise be random noise whose energy density be constant for a constant bandwidth that be a hz wide band at hz will have precisely the same amount of energy a a hz band at khz pink noise be random noise whose energy density be constant for a constant precentage bandwidth thu a wide band of noise at hz whose bandwidth be hz will contain the same energy a a wide band at khz whose bandwidth be hz wide white noise be often use with spectrum analyzer that have constant bandwidth pink noise be use with audio-type real-time analyzer whose bandwidth be centert-frequency dependent often describe a octave or octave or some such terminology white noise relative to pink noise ha more energy at high frequency at a rate equal to db per octave pink noise relative to white noise ha more energy at low frequency at a rate equl to again dick pierce loudspeaker and software consulting sartelle street pepperell ma voice and fax
