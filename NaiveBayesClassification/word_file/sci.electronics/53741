from baker john p pdd subject how do differential mode gp work i understand that the new gp box now have an option know a differential ready apparently land-based beacon tranmit gp correction information to ymy gp receiver with differential option instal how do thi system work what frequency be use for the land-based beacon thank in advance charlie thompson here a rough sketch of how the system work a reference station with a very exactly know position compute the error in the incoming gp signal these error be due to several factor include atmospheric distortion sa selective availability time dither etc the reference unit contain complex computational equipment to back out the error in it position since it know where it be already it then transmit these correction on a broadcast which be available to any number of relatively local receiver if the receiver be nearby and be use the same satellite a the reference unit the error should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit thu the receiver unit may apply the correction calculate by the reference unit the u coast guard be currently a far a i know instal a series of coastline transmitter for differential gp these station will use exist radio tower i believe the frequency be to be approximately khz there be many other private corporation offer dgp signal on different frequency for example pinpoint offer correction signal and receiver unit use an fm broadcast system which ha station all acros the u the correction code be usually transmit use the rtcm format advertised accuracy espouse to meter error john p baker my opinion be my own i do know john hopkin university anyone else who want them anyway applied physic laboratory laurel md
