from tgg tom gardner subject re can radio freq be used to measure distance in robert g carpenter write i wonder if it possible to use radio wave to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver ye it call radar seem to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance thi would be for short distance ft and i would need to have accuracy of inch or so depend on the environment in a static environent such a a waveguide ye in a dynamic environment with object move about the multipath kill thi concept how about measure vertical distance a well any chance or be i get ridiculou what be the difference between vertical and horizontal what frequency would be best for thi or do matter thi depend on the require range the require accuracy the allowable ambiguity in range the frequency the fcc etc allow you to use
