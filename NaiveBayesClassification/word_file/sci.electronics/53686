from henry henry spencer subject re in article mpaul marxhausen paul write ok what a quick rundown on all the series variation we repair something with a on it and the question arise well do i really need the act part flipping through digi-key i see al a c hc ac acq act hct acht hctl here something i post about thi a few year ago it not fully up to date with all the new variation some of which be just different manufacturer synonym in practical term ignore the technological detail thi be my view of the family nb i be not a giant corporation which influence my view on thing like availability and backward compatibility the original speed good power consumption fair effectively obsolete now use or later except for a very few oddball function like which be hard to find in newer family modification of for higher speed at the cost of higher power consumption very obsolete use modification of for lower power at the cost of lower speed very obsolete use cmo later modification of for even higher speed at some cost in power consumption effectively obsolete use combination of and for speed comparable to with lower power consumption best all-round ttl now widest variety of device fast a blaze power not too bad the clear choice for high speed in ttl availability and price generally good failed competitor to although a few part do thing that be hard to find in and thu be still useful possible replacement for generally soup up still fairly new availability and price possibly a problem fairly old family cmo device with ttl pinout competed with series not too successfully obsolete use or newer cmo family thrown in a the major non-ecl logic family the old cmo family still viable because of very wide range of device low power consumption and wide range of supply voltage not fast very forgive and easy to work with beware static electricity but that comment apply to many other modern logic family too there be neat device in thi family that exist in no other the clear choice when speed be not important a new attempt at cmo fast compare to old cmo power consumption often lower than ttl possibly a good choice for general-purpose logic assume availability and affordability cmo logic level not ttl one beware very limit range of supply voltage compare to older cmo also major rise of power consumption at faster speed with ttl logic level much the same comment a read the fine print on thing like power consumption ttl compatibility in cmo involf some compromise thrown in for speed freak the low end of ecl variou source claim that it be easier to work with than super-fast ttl for seriou high-speed work les forgive though read and follow the rule or it wo work availability to hobbyist limit can be expensive for real speed freak hot ecl harder to handle than and inconvenient package much more useful datasheet however a for compatibility between family the family except and be all more or le logic-level compatible but how many device you can drive from one output vary enormously with x and y you just have to read the spec and do the arithmetic and be compatible with the other with a bite of hassle compatibility can be a bite of hassle or a lot of hassle depend on what supply voltage be use or to anything else be considerable hassle me i use and with a sprinkle of t and be interest but i have use either significantly yet all work be one man work henry spencer u of toronto zoology kipling henry utzoo henry
