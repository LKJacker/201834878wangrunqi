from caryd cary david allen subject self-modifying hardware permit me to quote fragment of praetzel article out of context newsgroup from praetzel eric praetzel date feb gmt currently the xnf format be propierty and i know of at least on person at a university who wa able to get it after sign a non-disclosure agreement the xilinx-bit map format be pretty well top secret i would love to know it because then you could make a it be i have to reverse eng the xilinx tool to dump the bite map to the fpga because it only run on the computer with the hardware key self-modifying hardware could be very interest computer that could write thier own program assembler compiler be an immense breakthrough from calculator that could i eagerly await a programmable gate array which use a pd format and do not cost ymy first bear to program till then we will keep on reverse engineer whatever we can a it be one company that i work at ha go under fpga be what they need to make their product competitive they could not afford them in the end you could say that they could not afford to not use them but the management discover that too late eric my condolence i ca even imagine what i could do with self-modifing hardware i can imagine self-modifying software and even though all my teacher say that bad even worse than goto check out what the expert use to say about self-modifying code he use order rather than opcode on the principle of large scale computing machine by goldstine and von neumann collect in john von neumann collected work vol v reprint here with absolutely no permission from anyone we plan to have a full size binary digit word hold either contain full size number equivalent to decimal digit but we will use the first binary digit to denote the sign or two binary digit order it should be add that thi technique of automatic substitution into order the machine ability to modify it own order under the control of other one among it order be absolutely necessary for a flexible code thu if part of the memory be use a a function table then look up a value of that function for a value of the variable which be obtain in the course of the computation require that the machine itself should modify or rather make up the reference to the memory in the order which control thi look up and the machine can only make thi modification after it ha already calculate the value of the variable in question on the other hand thi ability of the machine to modify it own order be one of the thing which make cod the non-trivial operation which we have to view it a david cary tenor e and comp engineer finger caryd s e ave tulsa ok usa sol universe v david cary tenor e and comp engineer finger caryd s e ave tulsa ok usa sol universe v
