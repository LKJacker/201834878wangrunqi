from ggruscho george gruschow subject re how to the disk copy protect seharus babak seharus write in mblock matt block write in article seharus babak seharus write i wa wonder what copy protection technique be avaliable and how effective be they ha anyone have any experience in thi area with highest regard babak seharus uh oh umm there be a number of copy protection scheme some involve modify the physical medium and some involve encryption scheme c all of the one that have exist over the course of compute have be successful for a time i recall however near monthly release of new way to crack the copy protection scheme of the latest release the fact be none of them be completely secure or anywhere near it some be more or le difficult to crack and some have already be crack i gues what i be say be that ymy question be difficult if not impossible to answer what exactly do you want to know do you need a good one for a project you be work on how secure must it be are you try to crack one that someone else ha use i can probably make suggestion assume the activity be strictly legal in general it be a bad idea legally to tamper with copy protection it can also lead to corruption of file which you necessarily do not have back up of be a they be copy protect which can be devestating do you have absolutely no idea for practical application and be merely curiou please clear up those question and i try to help a much a i can incidentally the uh oh at the top be indicative of the dread anyone who ha watch their friend hack equipment be cart off feel when they be ask how to hack the area you be broach be work with danger many of which include break the law or at least address it from one side or the other matt i have write a program and i want to market it i would like certain degree of protection since my main custmer be individual and not the cooperation i know laser hole burn method and hardware key method however my software be go to cost only so i can not afford that also at thi low price i can not afford person make too many copy of my software well i gues say upto illigal copy be ok by me however i do not want someone to get a copy of pctool and copy my software off course i never mean to forbid the true hacker from copy since they can develope a better program anyway with highest regard babak seharus one of the most popular method of course be the password check where they ask you for a word from page x line y and word z but thi be pitifully simple to remove unles you throw some checksum into the main part of ymy program and some self-rewriting code to confuse some person also make sure that ymy program can not be run out a debugger another method of course be to not even make bad sector on the original disk just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector to help you here you also must do the code protection scheme mention in the first paragraph make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated part of the disk with garbage a well or they wan na be cracker can just look for the junk in some random sector like you mention there be the laser hole disk and hardware key but they be both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user which you be the opposite of what you want another configuration that can be use be to save the configuration of the machine that it be be instal to in the most undecipherable format you can think of if the program do not find that thi be the same system it request be instal by the original disk again the original disk should be encrypt compact have many sector that should be check and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original can not be copy once again you must put code-encryption self-rewriting code and multiple crc check in the program to make sure that it do not get change among other thing thi also protect ymy program from virius if the program detect a change in it code tell the user that a viru ha be detect in the program tell them the program be viru secure and remember you have help the world kill some pirate and kill some viruse feel good i hope that i have help have fun knock some crack out well you ca do it everything that can be write can be crack but you off in the proces goodbye what be the program that will be sell george gruschow death do you gronk ggruscho
