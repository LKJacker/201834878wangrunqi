from webb webber ah subject re adcom cheap product aaron lung alung write i wa also sceptical about the amp be build in the far-east or where-ever but if you look in the amp and see what component they use and how it wa design you can easily see why the amplifier sound so brilliant good point also i would be surprise that the component they use off-shore be of inferior quality a long a it wa properly design and robust premium component be use it should matter where it be assemble definately i agree wholeheartedly if they can build the amp where the labmy be not so expensive they can afford to put decent component in and go to more effort to improve the design of the amplifier a adcom ha do i can not see why person say the amplifier wo last not with those quality component inside sure the amp run very fairly hot but that how you get an amp to sound incredibly good an amp that run hot ha no bear on how it gon na sound the amp you have probably be run class-a the whole day actually i be wary of excessively hot amp even though the component inside may be rat to run that way excessive heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component regardles of quality in fact an amp that do run hot to the touch be because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp want to skimp on heatsinking or cool to save cost hmmmmm sure i do mean to imply that because of the heat generate the amp sound good my adcom gfp run fairly warm not hot to the touch but enough to satisfy me that the amp be run nicely i do like it when an amp run dead-cold it make one think that the amp be do nothing the heatsink that adcom use in their amp be certainly far for skimpy they massive thing with heat vent both below and above more than enough to carry away excessive heat my opinion once again alan webber webb webb the path you tread be narrow and the drop be sheer and very high the raven all be watch from a vantage point near by apprehension creep like a choo-train up ymy spine will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme
