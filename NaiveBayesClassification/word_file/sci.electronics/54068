from cmh hick subject re making up odd resistor value require by filter idh ian hawkin write when construct active filter odd value of resistor be often require something like a k ohm resistor it seem best to choose common capacitor value and cope with the strange resistance then demand is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance give fix resistor of the standard value per decade etc it be a common enough problem yet i cant recall see a program that tell that gife rq start with q and find prefer value x y and z i once write such a program in bbc basic it wa very crude and take around second to do an exhaustive search with a small amount of intelligence and tell you the best combination rq and the best below rq if you want to write one just store the prefer value in an array and then search the solution space use three nest loop i sure you could knock thi up in an hmy christopher christopher hick paradise be a linear gaussian world cmh also report to taste hot and sweaty
