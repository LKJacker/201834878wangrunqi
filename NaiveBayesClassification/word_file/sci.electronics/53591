from seema seema varma subject ic package hi i be look for some help in choose a package for a high-speed silicon adc currently be fabricate thi be a phd research project and i have to test the chip at speed on a pcb i expect to have roughly package circuit and will do dc low-speed and high-speed test use different set-up for the test chip i know for sure that a dip will not work the long lead line have too high an inductance getting a custom-made package be too expensive so i be try to choose between a flatpak and a leadles chip carrier the flatpack would be hard to test since it ha to be solder on to the test setup and i would spend load of time solder a i keep change the test chip the leadles chip carrier socket also have long lead line and may not work at high speed do anyone out there have of thi field i would greatly appreciate help any idea name of company manufacture would help the multi-layer fancy gaa package seem like a bite of overkill seema varma
