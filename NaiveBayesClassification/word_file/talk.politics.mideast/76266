from dbd david davidian subject account of anti-armenian human right violation in azerbaijan account of anti-armenian human right violation in azerbaijan prelude to current event in nagorno-karabakh i saw a naked girl with her hair down they be drag her she keep fall because they be push her and kick her she fell down it wa muddy there and later other witness who saw it from their balcony tell u they seize her by the hair and drag her a couple of block a far a the mortgage bank that a good block and a half or two from here i know thi for sure because i saw it myself deposition of tatyana mikhailovna arutunian nezhintseva born train conductor azerbaijani railroad resident at building apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan i have live very long in sumgait only eight year i move there from novosibirsk my son enter the baku nautical school and so i transfer to azerbaijan later i meet someone and marry him and now my name be arutunian my husband name that there would be a massacre wa not discuss openly but there be hint and gibe so to speak at the armenian person and they be mock the russian too i wa constantly aware of it at work and not just thi past year i could find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because i i just say it could steal could deceive and could be involve in bribe-taking and when i ask for decent work condition they tell me leave do keep the other from work you be cut out for thi kind of work and at work and around all the time i would hear gibe at the armenian like the turk have it right they kill them all the way they multiply here they make it hard for u to live and thing will be just fine if we get rid of them all no problem the turk will help they say if we ask them they rid armenium of armenian in half an hmy well that the way it all wa but i never think of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy because you just could imagine it here we be live under the soviet government for year and no one even consider such an idea possible but i have be form my own opinion and in the presence of authoritative person i would often ask where be thi all lead do person really not see what kind of situation be emerge here the russian be flee sumgait there be very few of them leave why be no one deal with thi what go on and when it all happen on the and it become clear that everything have be arrange by someone because what else be you to make of it if the first secretary of the city party committee be march ahead of the demonstration with an azerbaijani flag i would be say thi now if i have receive personal confirmation from him later because when we be under guard in the sk club on the he come to the club that muslimzade the woman tell me there he be there he be that muslimzade i do believe the rumor that he have carry an azerbaijani flag i think that they be just false rumor i go over to him and say are you the first secretary of my city party committee he answer me ye and i ask him tell me do you really march ahead of that gang carry an azerbaijani flag and behind you they be carry denigrate sign i do know exactly what they say but there wa mention of armenian blood and he tell me ye i wa there but i try to dissuade them from it then i ask him another question and where be you when they be burn and slaughter u and he say i we do know what to do we do know we do anticipate that that would happen in sumgait comrade mamedov the first deputy chairman of the council of minister of the azerbaijani ssr answer the same question for me no we actually do anticipate the slaughter in sumgait at that time we be try to contain the crowd of in baku that wa prepare for a massacre those be hi exact word the one he say in the office of the council of minister of the armenian ssr and now about the event themself of course it painful to discus them because it may seem that it not true to someone else variou rumor concern what happen be make the round some be true other be but unfortunately there be more true one than false because it wa so horrible in my age here in the space age the age of science the age of progress i do know if someone have tell me thi story if i be live in or around moscow i would have believe it why not because it wa really a genocide it wa a massacre that genuinely what it wa for example on that day the i do know about the because my husband and i be both sick both of u have the flu and we be in bed on the my neighbor come to my place and say you in bed you do know anything about it there wa a demonstration in town and after it they be overturn armenian car and burn them they be look into car and ask you an armenian if they answer in armenian then they turn the car over and burn it thi be make up the wife of the senior investigator of the baku ministry of internal affair tell u he wa return home from hi dacha with hi wife raisa sevastyanova she my neighbor she immediately come and tell li that they have land right in the middle of it i do know what to call it the cavalcade of automobile they be stop he answer in azerbaijani they let them go but they make him honk the horn they be kick up a fraca we do even believe it and i say certainly that do happen how can that be and she say muslimzade wa lead the crowd and the sputnik store wa completely smash because most of the salesperson there be armenian and when he saw that they have start break the glas in that store he say do break the shop window do destroy state property but do whatever else you want i do hear thi with my own two ear but it be a fact that the store wa tear up and the director of the store wa beat for employ armenian although he an azerbaijani while we be talk all of a sudden right acros from u sevastyanova be the first to look out the window and say look there a crowd out there and sure enough when we look out there we saw that the crowd have already start wreck the neighbor build there wa an armenian family there a woman and two girl they live acros from u i sorry i do know the build number or the person name since we be in my husband apartment in microdistrict and i live in microdistrict no there wa awful loot go on there at the time the most hideou thing be go on there then one build there our wa attack twice once wa enough for them they return to the place where they have finish the armenian off if an azerbaijani family dare to conceal armenian they beat the azerbaijani too they also beat russian if it wa russian do the hide because there be russian among them they say so on television there be person of variou nationality but they do tell u why there be person of different nationality because they would have touch the azerbaijani if they have dare to stick up for the armenian and give them temporary shelter in their home at the time i saw thi from the window i wa there sevastyanova wa there and so wa my husband we go out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony all kind of thing even a sofa then when it wa all down there they burn it up then we saw the crowd and they be all ooh at first i could figure out what wa happen and later i tell my husband lendrush l think they beat someone out there and he answer i do know could be suddenly the crowd separate for a moment and i saw it and raisa sevastyanova saw it too my husband have turn the other way he do see it i saw a naked girl with her hair down they be drag her she keep fall because they be push her and kick her she fell down it wa muddy there and later other witness who saw it from their balcony tell u they seize her by the hair and drag her a couple of block a far a the mortgage bank that a good block and a half or two from here i know thi for sure because i saw it myself then the crowd rush toward my build we be stand there and you can of course imagine what we be feel were they go to kill u or not and i also have the awful think that they might torment me the way they torment that woman because i have just see that i ask my husband i give him an axe and say you kill me first and then let them do what they want with the corpse but my neighbor it true defend u they say there be any armenian in my entryway go away only muslim live here disaster miss u that time but at two in the morning a crowd of about person approximately come back to my place my husband wa already asleep he can sleep when he upset about something but i ca i wa stand run from balcony to balcony my power wa out i do remember for how long but it wa a though it have be deliberately turn off there be no light whatsoever and i wa glad of course i think it wa better that way but then i look and the crowd be at my balcony thi wa at in the morning the first time they be at my build it wa and now it wa in the morning but i never think that that old woman on the first floor the azerbaijani wa awake and watch out there be human be among them too so she go out with a pail of garbage a though she need to be take garbage out at two in the morning she use it a a pretext and go toward those young person they really be youngster from my balcony you could see perfectly that they be young azerbaijani boy they speak azerbaijani and when they come up to her she say what do you want and they answer we want the armenian family that life here point toward the second floor with their hand she say i already tell you we do have any armenian here now leave do you hear thi be an old muslim woman talk to you and grab the hand of one boy who wa try to walk around her and enter the build anyway and start push him away and so they seem to listen to her they be all very young they start apologize and leave that wa the second time death wa at my door i forget to mention about one other apartment a man name rubik life there i do know him really i know hi daughter i mean i saw her around but we really do know them but i do know that that guy who life on the fourth floor acros from my entryway go to chernobyl and work there for eight month to earn money can you imagine what that mean he risk hi life to earn x amount of money in order to better hi family he buy new furniture and wa get ready to give hi daughter hand in marriage but ala everything wa ruin by those creep and scoundrel they throw everything out the window and the rest we saw from my balcony how the neighbor on the leave and right run into the apartment and carry off everything that have already be smash or take what be one to think of that it mean that the parent in those family be in on it too unfortunately i come to be of the opinion that it wa all organize and that everything have be foresee in advance both the beat of the armenian and the strip of apartment something on the order of we move the armenian out and take over their apartment i have work honestly my whole life you can check everything about me i come a a patriot from china wait for night on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr i come to my homeland a a patriot because i know that the party and the komsomol be holy thing but when i saw in sumgait that there wa anything holy about them that party membership wa buy that komsomol member join only for personal gain that there be no ideal no idea god save me everything wa be buy and sell i saw all of it and understand how they could allow that crap to go on like it do i ca talk any more about it the image of that beat when i go out of my own apartment they pick u up under soviet army guard they have arrive from all over to suppres that gang not only armenian but some russian family and their child too come out of their apartment and join u because no normal person who have see that could stay there with the situation the way it wa and what interest be that when we leave on the bus i ride and think that at least one group of person for sure person would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for the armenian would somehow understand the injustice of what wa do but have analyze and weigh the whole thing once i calm down have think it all through i come to a conclusion that be share by many person if a lot of azerbaijani do want their armenian neighbor to be kill and that basically depend on that muslimzade he say that he have want to calm them down then be it possible that he do have person at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute go and announce it on television citizen of sumgait take what you can into ymy hand let protect my neighbor from thi massacre those crowd be such that there wa no control them basically they be unarm they do have firearm mostly they have knife they have all kind of metal part like armature shaft sharpen at the end special rock different to a degree that we notice them there be rock like those in sumgait soil they be bring from somewhere a though it be all specially plan so a i wa say i weigh it all out and if any of my neighbor have want to defend u why wa it arrange it mean that the government do want to do it when the crowd wa move from the city party committee to the sputnik what there wa no way of inform baku no there wa no way it turn out the crowd wa do violence in my microdistrict i wo mention the thing i do see myself i only talk about the thing i myself witness they be in microdistrict begin at in the even when i saw them from the other build and they be somewhere else until mid-night or one in the morning because at they come back to my build they have completely finish make their predatory round of microdistrict when they return to my build i tell my husband lendrush now the polouse be probably go to come my god now the authority be probably go to find out and come to my aid well ala no there be to be no authority not a single policeman not a single fireman not a single ambulance come while they be rag a it turn out a we later find out begin on the might of the there be dead person ruin apartment and burn auto one car near the bu station it wa burn and overturn it wa probably there about fmy day everyone saw it and what go on in block those who live there know they saw from their balcony how they attack the soldier in the bus how they beat those poor unarm soldier and how on that square i ca remember the name of it where there be that fork come from the bu station that intersection now i upset and i ca think of the name there a tall build there a and from the balcony there person saw that butchery when the poor soldier wear only helmet with shield and those unfortunate club move against that mob and when they fell those boy run up and use stone big heavy stone beat them to death on their head who could have guess that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government the upshot be that thi republic ha not be under soviet control for a long time but no one want to pay any attention or get involve if you be to go and ask at my work many person would confirm that i tell the truth i be struggle for truth for five year there already the five year that i work at the azerbaijani railroad some person there consider me a demagogue other who know what some think i an adventure seeker and some a prankster but i want everything to be right i would become outrage how can thi be why be it person treat one another thi way on a soviet railroad a though the azerbaijani railroad be azerbaijani property or the property of some magnate or some mafium if i want to i get you out of here if i want to i get rid of you if i want to i do something else and there a black market price for everything in the most brazen way a coach to moscow cost so much a coach on a local train cost so much once when i wa complain to the head of the conductor pool he have the nerve to tell me maybe you wo even believe thi but thi i afraid i hear with my own ear tatyana just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect you alone against everyone so instead why do you give more money to the chief conductor and everything will go fine for you i start to cry turn and leave what else could i do where else could i go to complain i realize that everything wa useles and the root of the whole thing be that it all go on and no one want to see it i file a write complaint and they grind it into dust they destroy it i still have a copy but what the use when the general procuracy get involve with the investigation of the bloody sumgait affair in addition to the information about what i saw what i wa a witnes to i give testimony about the mafium at the railroad they accept my petition but i do know if they go to pursue it or not because you excuse me i no longer believe in the thing i aspire to the thing i believe in before it all dead they just spit on my soul stomp on everything physically and most important spiritually because you can lose belong that nonsense that all come with time but when ymy soul be spit upon and when the best in you ymy belief be destroy it can be very difficult to restore them i want to tell of one incident i just do know at the time i wa in such a state that i do even take minor thing into account here be an example of course it not a minor one my neighbor raisa sevastyanova she ha a son valery who be in the grade in a school in microdistrict a boy vitaly danielian i do know hi last name go to school with him or rather go to school with him i wa just sit in an apartment try to make a phone call to moscow oh ye and there one important detail when the massacre begin for two to three hour the phone be work in armenian apartment and later in several russian and azerbaijani apartment but the fact of the matter be that service wa shut off you could not call anywhere why again it mean it wa all plan how come service be cut off for no reason and the light go off and those brat be rag a they like they be afraid they run about freely they that no one would slap their hand and no one would dare to stop them they know it now i go to tell about the incident so thi little vitaly vitalik an armenian boy go to school with valery they be in the same clas according to what valery and hi neighbor pal say at the time i wa in the same apartment a they be i sit at the phone wait for the call to be put through a mob attack the build where vitalik live so valery run to hi mother and say mamma please let me go to vitalik what if they kill him maybe he still alive maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow he a nice guy we all like him he a good person he smart hi mother would let him go in tear she say valery you ca go because i be afraid he say mamma we can get around the crowd we just watch just have a look they make it through i do know i think vitalik parent live in microdistrict no and when they get there they make a superficial deduction knowing that balcony and door be be break everywhere that you could see from the street which be the armenian apartment in the build they go here and there and look and saw that the window be intact and so they calm down but even though the window in that apartment be not break everything inside wa totally smash and vitalik lay there with a break skull and hi mother and father have already be murder little vitalik do even know they be dead so two week ago i do know he wa in critical condition no maybe it wa longer we leave sumgait on march spend some time in moscow and then we come to yerevan so it be about a month already it so hard to keep all thi straight so valery the next day when he find out that vitalik family ha be kill and vitalik wa ling in the semashko hospital in baku valery and hi classmate get together and go to visit him but they would admit them tell them that he wa in critical condition and that he wa still in a coma they cry and leave have also find out that the girl i saw be kick and drag wa in that hospital too a it turn out she wa bring there in seriou condition but at least she wa alive at the time when we get to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another throw ourself into their arm and ki them because you have wonder if these friend be alive or not if those friend be alive or not and when you saw them you be so glad to find out that the family have live when you saw person you hear thing that make ymy hair stand on end if you publish everything that happen it will be a hideou book a book of thing it be even difficult to believe and those two girl who be rap be entirely black and blue the one at the sk they know i not lie that girlfriend come up to one of them and say what happen and she bar her breast and they be completely cover in cigarette burn those rogue have put cigarette out on her breast after something like that i do know how you can live in a city and look at the person in it now when we stay at the military unit for a while they provide well basic condition for u there the military unit be locate in nasosny some six mile from sumgait and live there we meet with a larger group of person there be about person at the unit you know there wa a point when i could even go outside because if you go outside you saw so much heartbreak around you and when you hear the false rumor ye by the way false rumor be spread in sumgait say that the armenian around yerevan have destroy azerbaijani village and raze them to the grind with bulldozer i do know whether to believe it or not and person who do know any better get the idea that it wa all do in revenge but when i arrive in armenium and wa in spitak and in spitak all those village be not only intact but at that time have even be protect just in case they be guard they get better food than do the inhabitant of spitak not a single person there die and no one be plan to harm them around yerevan all the village be safe and unharmed and the armenian do attack anyone but actually after an evil of the magnitude suffer in sumgait there could have be a feel of vengefulnes but no one act on it and i do know why you sometime hear accusation to the effect that the armenian be guilty that it be they who organize it rumor like that be be spread in azerbaijan and if one old person say it and ten young one hear it they not only perceive it with their mind but with their heart too to them it seem that the older person be tell the truth for example one say did you know that out of person kill by the way originally they say person but later they find a be azerbaijani and one wa an armenian of course i upset but it utterly impossible to discus such thing and not become upset sometime l forget thing but i know i want to return to the time when we be in the sk club acros from the city party committee when i saw muslimzade in the sk club build i go to him to ask because i could believe that he have march in the front carry a banner i already mention thi and if i repeat anything please excuse me i ask him why do you do that and why be you here now why do you come here to laugh at these woman who be strew about on the floor the overcrowd there wa tremendou it wa completely unsanitary and several of the child be already sick it true the troop try to make it livable for u they cook for u on their field stave and provide u with wonderful food but the thing be that their main job wa to ferret out the gang that wa still at it everywhere that wa continue it sordid affair everywhere plu they be never give any direct order they do know what they be authorize to do and not to do and it wa only on march at five in the even that krayev himself the lieutenant general the city commandant of sumgait wa give full authority and tell everyone over a microphone from an armor personnel carrier that now he could do what he want to do a hi heart advise him and relocate person to the military unit but that not what i want to talk about now muslimzade characteristically try to get me out of the sk build and take me to the city party committee which be acros the square from the club he take me by the hand and say citizen do worry we go and have a talk in my office i tell him no after everything you do i do believe one iotum of what you say if i go to the city party committee i disappear and the trace of me will disappear too because you ca stand it when oh ye and there wa another interest detail from that meet it wa even very funny although at the time i wa up to laugh he wa in a nice expensive hat and so a to put him to shame so to speak i say oh why do you come here all duded up like a london dandy you smell of good perfume you in ymy starch shirt and you have ymy expensive hat on you come to ridicule the poor woman and child who be lie on the floor who be already get sick whose relative have die did you come to laugh at them and the one who wa accompany him an azerbaijani i do know who he wa or what hi title wa he quickly snatch the hat off muslimzade head and hide it then i say my god we not marauder we not you we do come to you with the intention of steal well kill me kill me muslimzade say to me but i not guilty kill me kill me but i not guilty and i say ok fine you not guilty have it ymy way but give u an answer we ask you where be you when they be torture and rap those poor woman when they be kill the child burn thing carry on outrageously and wreck all those apartment where be you then you know we do expect it we do not know what to do we do anticipate that something like that would happen in sumgait i start laugh and say it truly funny he say what could i do we do know what to do and i say i sorry but it be ridiculou if i tell you the first secretary of the city party committee should march out in front with a banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cro over hi dead body that what you should have do that the way it wa during the war not a single party committee secretary compromise himself either he die or he lead person into battle and what do you do you run away you leave you hide you march with a flag because you be afraid excuse my language you fear for ymy own damn hide and when we ask you you tell u that you get confuse and you ask me what you could have do that right i tell him the city party committee get confuse all the party committee get confuse the polouse get confuse baku get confuse they all lay in a faint for two week and the gang run the show with impunity and if it be for the troop it would have be just two day there would be a single armenian leave in sumgait for sure they would have finish their bloody affair because they brazenly go up to some russian too the one who try to say something to them and they tell them soon a we finish with the armenian we come after you too and by the way there wa a colonel who take u to the military unit he wa the one with the light blue collar tab who fly in and two hour later arrive on an armor personnel carrier when we be at the sk and take u to the military unit and who later start move u from the military unit we ask him what how what will come of u he openly say you know for u the main thing now be to catch that gang we finish that quickly you stay at the military unit for the time be and we decide later the general procuracy of the ussr arrive it consist of investigator from all city there be some from stavropol from everywhere just everywhere because the affair wa truly frightful about thi by the way comrade katusev speak a everyone know he the first deputy general procurator of the ussr when he give u a speech from the armor personnel carrier at the military unit by the way he tell u the honest truth because he could not say it because he wa still experience hi first impression of what he have see and he say there wa afghanistan and it wa bad but sumgait it horrible and the person who dare to do such a thing will be severely punish in accordance with my law and that a quote then one mother throw herself at him her two son have die before her very eye and say who will return my son who be go to punish the culprit they try to calm her down and he say in order for u to conduct a proper investigation in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility you must help u because we do know maybe there wa someone else in the gang who be now be conceal in home and maybe the neighbor know maybe someone saw something do be afraid write about it in detail so that you not afraid everyone know that many of you be afraid have live through such horror they think that if they write the whole truth about let say their neighbor or someone else that they will seek revenge later we go to do it like thi we go to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there we do need to know who write it the name of the person who write wo be make public but we need all the information let each and every one not be afraid let each write what be necessary who they saw in that gang who make threat or shout threaten gibe about the armenian you must describe all of these person and put the information into the urn two soldier and a major guard the urn and sure enough many person person who do even want to write i know one woman who ask me she come up and say you a a russian the same thing wo happen to you a will happen to me so please i give you the information and you please write it down for me so she wa afraid and there be a lot like her but later after katusev make hi speech she sit and write down everything she know and we throw it all into the urn now we do know if it will be of any use for a factual picture will emerge from all that information one person can lie but thousand ca lie thousand simply ca lie you have to agree with that a fact be a fact why for example should someone say that black be white if it be really black the first deputy chairman of the council of minister of the azerbaijani ssr mamedov a i say wa in yerevan my husband and i be at the council of minister of the armenian ssr and find out that mamedov wa present the one who have come to convince the person of sumgait to return to their previou dwell to their old apartment we ask for a meet with him and it wa grant when we go to see him he try to behave properly very politely delicately but when the truth wa tell right to hi face and when i ask him some of the same question i have ask muslimzade where be you personally when they be beat u now you try to convince u to return why do you think at the time that they be slaughter u where it wa all lead he say you tell the truth let not mince word you tell me right to my face and i tell you straight i tell you the pure truth i wa get out of bed in the even the whole government wa up include me and we be restrain a crowd of about in baku but we never expect that in a city like sumgait with it fine international record such a thing could happen we expect it in baku i say so that mean you expect it all the same why be you expect it and he say you know it just happen that way we be expect it in baku we be try to restrain it but in sumgait i say fine you do know for the first three or fmy hour but then you should have know why do no one help u and he say well ok we do know what to do and thing like that basically it wa the same story i get from muslimzade later when he say you go on back the situation in sumgait be favorable now everything be fine the armenian be friendly with the azerbaijani to thi l answer you know what i speak with you a a member of a neutral nation i have never argue with armenian or with azerbaijani and i wa an eyewitnes you tell me please comrade mamedov i ask him what would you say about thi honestly if you be be completely frank with u then he say ye i admit that i be honestly ashamed shame on the entire azerbaijani nation we have disgrace ourself not only before the entire soviet union but before the whole world because now the voice of america and all the other foreign radio station of variou hue be brand u with all kind of rumor too and i say there nothing to add to what really happen i do think it possible to add anything more awful he say ye i agree with you i understand ymy pain it be truly an unfortunate occurrence i repeat that he say unfortunate occurrence and then he suddenly remember himself what he wa say he have a pen in hi hand he wa fidget with it nervously and say oh excuse me a tragedy really i take thi to mean that he really think it an unfortunate occurrence and of course he say i understand that have go through all thi you ca return to sumgait but it necessary to cool down and realize that all those person be be try and he even give a detail which i do know if it matter or not that policeman be be try specifically in relation to that bloody affair ye by the way there be another good detail how i wa set up at work in baku after the event i go to an undergarment plant there wa an azerbaijani work there and suddenly she tell me what they do nail ymy husband they screw up i wa floor i have imagine that anyone in baku too could say something like that well after that i go up to see to my office i need to find out about those day what wa go to happen with them how they be go to put down those day from february to march and the administrator tell me i do know tatyana go to the head of the conductor pool be grateful if they do put it down a unexcused absence i wa really discourage by thi they all know that we be but a hair away from death and barely survive and here they tell me that i wa skip work a though i wa off enjoy myself somewhere i go to the office of the chief of the pool hi last name be rasulov and he have that position for many year incidentally he a party member and be a big man in town and suddenly when i go to him and say comrade rasulov thi be the way it wa he look at me askance and say and why be you he know me by my previou last name why do you get wrap up in thi me i say what do you mean why do i get wrap up in thi me my husband an armenian i tell him i have an armenian last name and he screw up hi face make a kind of a grimace a though he have eat something smy and say i do expect that you would what do he mean by that and how should he behave the chief of the pool a man who supervise worker now it true there wa a reduction but for sure there be still conductor work for him and if someone who supervise a staff that size say thing like that then what can you expect from a simple uneducated politically unsophisticated person he go to believe any and all rumor that the armenian be like thi the armenian be like that and so on by the way that mamedov now i go back to mamedov office when i ask him are you really go to guarantee the safety of my life if we return to sumgait he answer ye you know i would guarantee them i do want to take on too much i would guarantee them firmly for year but i wo guarantee them for longer than year i say so you get another thing like that plan for year from now so they be quiet and then in another year it happen again i could contain myself any more and i also tell him and how do it get to that point certainly you know about it how they be treat the russian for example in baku and in sumgait how they be hound from their job certainly you receive complaint i write some myself why do no one respond to them why do everyone ignore what wa go on did you prepare person for thi by the way you treat them and he say you know you finally start to insult me he throw hi pen on the desk maybe now you say i a scoundrel too i say you know i not talk about you because i do know but about the one who i do know i can say with conviction ye that comrade wa involve in thi that and that because i know for certain well anyway he assure u that here in yerevan there be false rumor that sumgait armenian be here and be in sumgait and have get back to work everyone wa work he say and life wa very good we drive about the town ourself comrade arutiunian first secretary of the communist party of armenium ssr come from the council
