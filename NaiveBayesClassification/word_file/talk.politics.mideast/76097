from basil hamdan subject re wa go hezbollah in article shaig shai guday write snip imagine it be not a terrorist camp a you and the israeli like to view the village they be small community with kid play soccer in the street woman prepare lunch man play card etc i would not argue that all or even most of the village be terrorist camp there be however some which come very close to serve that purpose and that be not to say that other do not function in that way prior to the invasion the village i describe wa actually the closest i could come to describe mine i agree there may be other village where the civilian population ha desert because it be too close to israeli line and thu get bomb more often in such village often the only remain inhabitant be guerilla and some elderly who have nowhere else to go but for the most part the typical south lebanon village be more like mine one where civilian and guerilla live together they be often inhabit the same house many family be large some have member of the family involve in hizollah most other be not that be what be so hard of south lebanon israel be not fight an army with well draw battle line but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blend with the local populace not because they be evil coward that use woman and child a shield but because that be the only way one can fight a more powerful better equip occupy army some of the village and your might well be among them be a you describe not all be there be a large number of group in the area back by variou organization with a wide range of purpose hizbollah and amal be two of the larger one and may still be hizbollah and amal be now the main two militia though hizbollah person tend to be more commit to resistrance operation and better motivate by religiou conviction a to retaliation while mistake may be make that be still a far cry from indiscriminate bomb which would have produce major casualty it may be a mixture of what we both say sometime israel choose it target carefully at other time it just send it pilot on sortie aim at a town in general since it only know that the attacker come from that specific village but ha no further intelligence on several occasion israel retalliated against civilian refugee camp even in north lebanon just to show that it will not sit idly after it soldier have be attack most of the time it direct the sla to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some lebanese village on the other side i have experience thi shell myself on several occasion thi be why the sla militium be sometime even more despise than israeli troop well here we disagree i think that israel would willingly withdraw if the lebanese wa able to field a reliable force in the area to polouse it and prevent further attack i hope you be right on israeli willingnes to withdraw but i still contend that withdrawal would be the better course for israel security since it would reduce it military loss and i claim that the lebanese and syrian would be able to prevent any further attack on northern israel there seem to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstance and now the lebanese government ha prove that it be capable of control and disarm all militia a they do in all other part of lebanon no the syrian be more than happy to have israel sink into another lebanese moras i could elaborate if necessary hmm here we disagree on what serve syrium interest better i think syrium want to have lebanon all to itself it would be will to guarantee northern israel security in return for israeli withdrawal i do think syrium want israel to be involve in it protectorate of lebanon syrium be sit at the negotiate table because it ha come to accept that and want to get a political resolution a renewal of hostility along the lebanese front could put the whole me peace negotiation back in question i agree only in the case of the isareli soldier their kill can not be qualify a murder no matter what you say no but it be regretable a be the whole situation i agree that the los of any human life be deplorable and regrettable shai guday stealth bomber o software engineer thinking machine corp the wing ninja of the sky cambridge ma basil
