first point to note regard the appropriation of the history of the holocaust by zionist propaganda be that zionism without anti-semitism be impossible zionism agree with the basic tenet of anti-semitism namely that jew can not live with non jew the history and root of the holocaust go back a long way while the industru of death and destruction do not operate before it root be firmly place in the century jewish aspiration for emancipation emerge out of the national struggle in europe when the hope for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change be dash other alternative for improve the lot of the jew of europe achieve prominence the socialist bund a ma movement with enormou follow have to contend with opposition from a new and small almost insignificant opponent the political zionist in outline these two offer diametrically oppose option for jew in europe while the bund wa suggest join force with the rest of europe worker the zionist be propose a new programme aim at rid europe of it jew by set up some form of a jewish state historically nothing be inevitable all depend on the balance of force involve in the struggle history can be see a an option tree every time a certain option be choose other route become bar because of that choice movement backward to the point before that choice wa make be impossible while zionism a an option wa take by many young jew it remain a minority position until the first day of the reich the zionist federation of germany zvfd an organisation represent a tiny minority of german jew wa select by the nazi a the body to represent the jew of the reich it wa the only flag of an interantional organisation allow to fly in berlin and thi wa the only international organisation allow to operate during thi period from a marginal position the leader of the zionist federation be propel to a prominence and centrality that surprise even them all of a sudden they attain political power power base not on representation but from be select a the choice of the nazi regime for deal with the the problem their position in negotiate with the nazi agreement that affect the life of many ten of thousand of the jew in germany transform them from a utopian marginal organisation in germany and some other country in europe into a real option to be consider by german jew the best example of thi wa the agreement of immediately after the nazi takeover in jew all over the world support or be organise a world wide boycott of german good thi campaign hurt the nazi regime and the german authority search frantically for a way disable the boycott it wa clear that if jew and jewish organisation be to pull out the campaign would collapse thi problem wa solve by the zvfd a letter send to the nazi party a early a june outline the degree of agreement that exist between the two organisation on the question of race nation and the nature of the problem and it offer to collaborate with the new regime the realisation of zionism could only be hurt by resentment of jew abroad against the german development boycott propaganda such a be currently be carry out against germany in many way be in essence unzionist because zionism want not to do battle but to convince and build in their eagernes to gain credence and the back of the new regime the zionist organisation manage to undermine the boycott the main public act wa the signature of the transfer agreement with the nazi authority during the zionist congres of in essence the agreement wa design to get germany jew out of the country and into mandate palestine it provide a possibility for jew to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country through a transfer of german good to palestine thi right wa deny to jew leave to any other destination the zionist organisation wa the act agent through it financial organisation thi agreement operate on a number of front jew to leave the country break the ring of the boycott export german good in large quantity to palestine and last but not least enable the regime to be see a humane and reasonable even toward it avow enemy the jew after all they argue the jew do not belong in europe and now the jew come and agree with them after news of the agreement break the boycott wa doom if the zionist organization find it possible and necessary to deal with the nazi and import their good who could argue for a boycott thi wa not the first time that the interest of both movement be present to the german public a complementary baron von mildenstein the first head of the jewish department of the ss later follow by eichmann wa invite to travel to palestine thi he do in early in the company of a zionist leader kurt tuchler having spend six month in palestine he write a series of favourable article in der sturmer describe the jew of zionism a jew nazi could accept and understand thi little-known episode establish quite clearly the relationship during the early day of nazism between the new regime and the zvfd a relationship that wa echo later in a number of key instance even after the nature of the final solution become clear in many case thi mean a silence of report about the horror of the extermination a book concentrate on thi aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust be post-ugandan zionism in the crucible of the holocaust by s b beth-zvus in the case of the kastner episode around which jim allen play perdition be base even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of event do not exist it occur near the end of the war the ussr have advance almost up to germany italy and the african basis have be lose the nazi be on the run with a number of key country such a rumanium leave the axi a second front wa a matter of month away a the western ally prepare their force in the midst of all thi we find eichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder set up hi hz in occupy budapest after the german takeover of the country in april hi first act wa to have a conference with the jewish leadership and to appoint zionist federation member head by kastner a the agent and clear house for all jew and their relationship with the ss and the nazr authority why they do thi be not difficult to see a oppose to poland where it three and a half million jew live in ghetto and be visibly different from the rest of the polish population the hungarian jew be an integrate part of the community the middle clas wa mainly jewish the jew be mainly middle-clas they enjoy freedom of travel serve in the hungarian fascist army in fronline unit a officer and soldier their name be hungarian how wa eichmann to find them if they be to be exterminate the task wa not easy there be a million jew in hungary most of them resident the rest be refugee from other country many have hear about the fate of jew elsewhere and be unlikely to believe any statement by nazi official like elsewhere the only person who have the information and the ear of the frighten jewish population be the judenrat in thi case the judenrat comprsied mainly the zionist federation member without their help the ss with officer and le than man plu a few hundred hungarian polouse could not have collect and control a million jew when they do not even know their whereabout kastner and the other be leave under no illusion eichmann tell joel brand one of the member of kastner committee that he intend to send all hungary jew to auschwitz before he even start the expulsion he tell them clearly that all these jew will die a day unles certain condition be meet the committee face a simple choice to tell the jew of hungary about their fate with neutral rumanium where many could escape be in most case a few hour away or to collaborate with the nazi by assist in the concentration proces what would not have be believe when come from the ss sound quite plausible when come from the mouth of the zionist leadership thu it be that most of the hungarian jew go quietly to their death assure by their leadership that they be to be send to work camp to be sure there be thirty piece of silver in thi narrative of destruction the train of which eichmann promise to kastner a promise he keep to the last detail for eichmann it wa a bargain allow jew to survive a the price pay for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million jew there wa no way in which the jew of hungary could even be locate not to say murder without the full collaboration of kastner and hi few friend no doubt the ss would hunt a few jew here and there but the scale of the operation would have be miniscule compare to the half million who die in auschwitz it be important to realise that kastner wa not an aberration like say rumkovsky in lodz kastner act a a result of hi strongly hold zionist conviction hi action be a logical outcome of earlier position thi be instance when he expose to the gestapo the existence of a british cell of saboteur palgi and senesh and persuade them to give themself up so a not to disrupt hi operation at no point during hi trial or elsewhere do kastner deny that he know exactly what wa to happen to those jew to conclude the role play by zionist in thi period wa connect to another role they could and should have play that of alarm the whole world to what wa happen in europe they have the information but politically it wa contrary to their priority the priority be and still be quite simple all that further the zionist enterprise in palestine be follow whatever the price the life of individual jew and non-jew be secondary if thi proces require deal with fascist nazi and other assort dictatorial regime acros the world so be it
