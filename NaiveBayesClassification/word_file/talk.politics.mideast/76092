from basil hamdan subject re wa go hezbollah in article adam adam shostack write tell me do these young man also attack syrian troop in the south lebanon area only israeli and sla and lebanese troop be present syrian troop be deploy north of the awali river between the awali river and the security zone only lebanese troop be station with the blood of it soldier if israel be interest in peace than it should withdraw from my land there must be a guarantee of peace before thi happen it seem that many of these lebanese youth be unable to restrain themself from violence and unable to to realize that their action prolong israel stay in south lebanon that be ymy opinion and the opinion of the israeli government i agree peace guarantee would be better for all but i be address the problem a it stand now hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be conclude soon and will include security guarantee for both side my proposal wa aim at decrease the casualty in the interim period in my opinion if israel withdraw unilaterally it would still be better off than stay the israeli obviously agree with you and be not will to do such a move i hope to be be able to change ymy opinion and their that why i post to tpm if the lebanese army wa able to maintain the peace then israel would not have to be there until it be israel prefer that it soldier die rather than it child a i explain i contend that if israel do withdraw unilaterally i believe no attack would ensue against northern israel i also explain why i believe that to be the case my suggestion be aim at reduce the level of tension and casualty on all side it be unfortunate that israel do not agree with my opinion if israel really want to save some israeli life it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called security zone before the conclusion of the peace talk such a move would save israeli life advance peace effort give israel a great moral lift better israel public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociation since israel can rightly claim that it be genuinely interest in peace and ha already offer some important concession israel should withdraw from lebanon when a peace treaty be sign not a day before withdraw because of casualty would tell the lebanese person that all they need to do to push israel around be kill a few soldier it not gon na happen that be too bad along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarm by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attack against it northern city and that if such a shell occur than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it why should israel not demand thi while hold the buffer zone it seem to me that the better bargain position be while hold ymy neighbor land because israel be not occupy the security zone free of charge it be pay the price for that once israel withdraw it may have lose a bargain chip at the negociate table but it would save some soldier life that be my contention if lebanon be will to agree to those condition israel would quite probably have leave already unfortunately it do seem that the lebanese can disarm the hizbolah and maintain the peace that be completely untrue hizbollah be now a minor force in lebanese politic the real heavy weight be syrium ally the be support by syrium the lebanese army be over troop and unify like never before hizbollah can have no moral justification in attack israel proper especially after israeli withdrawal that would draw the ire of the lebanese the syrian and the israeli if israel do withdraw and such an act hizbolllah attack israel would be akin to political and moral suicide basil adam adam shostack adam if we have a budget big enough for drug and sexual favor we sure would waste them on member of congres john perry barlow
