from ramin ramin moshiri-tafreshi subject re europe v muslim bosnian my recollection of book be slitely different it be my understand that croat be ally of germany during wwius while serb have side with russium a a result serb do take a beat from croat not bosnian moslem while germany have the upper hand even today russian serb a their slovac brother thi be one of the issue involve in the lack of active intervention against serb a for the bosnian moslem i have not hear of any alliance with germany or russium in recent history therefore i be curiou if they do or be able to treat other party in thi conflict with same brutallity a they be get it today in the past history regard ramin moshirus
