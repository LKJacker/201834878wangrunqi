dairy publish book you find account of the massacre there include deir yassen though with the number of massacre man child and woman be greatly minimize there be no know write directly attributable to menachem begin which admit a massacre at deir yassin thu hasan be wrong a per request of hasan from the revolt by menachem begin dell publishing ny pp apart from the military aspect there be a moral aspect to the story of dir yassin at that village whose name wa publicize throughout the world both side suffer heavy casualty we have fmy kill and nearly forty wound the number of casualty wa nearly forty percent of the total number of the attacker the arab troop suffer casualty neraly three time a heavy the fight the word troop be unjustified there ha never be any evidence that there be any regular or irregular arab force in the village apart from the villager defend themself according to the haganah observer the force suffer a lot of casualty because they be incompetent soldier when they run into trouble secure the central part of the village a small group of palmach soldier come and take it without a single casualty begin failure to even mention the palmach be only one of the major inaccuracy to use a kind word in hi account incidentally three time a heavy may be correct a there be seriou evidence that the arab los wa closer to life than to the oft-quoted life however note that begin compare wound jew to dead arab he fail to mention the number of wound arab gues why wa thu very severe yet the hostile propaganda disseminate throughout the world deliberately ignore the fact that the civilian population of dir yassin wa actually give a warn by u before the battle begin one of my tender carry a loud speaker wa station at the entrance to the village and it exhort in arabic all woman child and age to leave their house and to take shelter on the slope of the hill by give thi humane warn my fighter throw away the element of complete surprise and thu increase their own risk in the ensue battle a be thoroughly establish by many source the loudspeaker truck get stick in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warn a substantial number of the inhabitant obey the warn and they be unhurt a few do not leave their stone house perhap because of the confusion the fire of the enemy wa murderou to which the number of my casualty bear eloquent testimony my man be compel to fight for every house to overcome the enemy they use large number of hand grenade and the civilian who have disregard my warn suffer inevitable casualty the education which we give my soldier throughout the year of revolt wa base on the observance of the traditional law of war we never break them unles the enemy first do so and thu force u in accordance with the accept custom of war to apply reprisal i be convince too that my officer and man wish to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the dir yassin battle but those who throw stone of denunciation at the conqueror of dir yassin would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy in connection with the capture of dir yassin the jewish agency find it necessary to send a letter of apology to abdullah whom mr ben gurion at a moment of great political emotion call wise ruler who seek the good of hi person and thi country the ruler whose mercenary force demolish gush etzion and fling the body of it heroic defender to bird of prey reply with feudal superciliousnes he reject the apology and reply that the jew be all to blame and that he do not believe in the existence of throughout the arab world and the world at large a wave of lie propaganda wa let loose about attrocity the enemy propaganda wa design to besmirch my name in the result it help u panic overwhelm the arab of eretz israel kolonium village which have previously repulse every attack of the haganah wa evacuate overnight and fell without further fight beit-iksa wa also evacuate these two place overlook the main road and their fall together with the capture of kastel by the haganah make it possible to keep open the road to jerusalem in the rest of the country too the arab begin to flee in terror even before they clash with jewish force not what happen at dir yassin but what wa invent about dir yassin help to carve the way to my decisive victory on the battlefield the legend of dir yassin help u in particular in the save of tiberia and the conquest of haifa it be worth note how begin dispute the standard myth that the palestinian arab flee a part of a calculate plan a footnote from the revolt to counteract the los of dir yassin a village of strategic importance arab headquarter at ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story allege a massacre by irgun troop of woman and child in the village certain jewish official fear the irgun man a political rival seize upon thi arab gruel propaganda to smear the irgun an eminent rabbi wa induce to reprimand the irgun before he have time to sift the truth out of evil however good come thi arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst arab and arab troop who be seize with panic at the mention of irgun soldier the legend wa worth half a dozen battalion to the force of israel the dir yassin massacre lie be still propagate by jew-hater all over the world apparently of israeli historian be jew-hater in reference to denunciation of dir yassin by fellow jew i have previously post quotation by irgun participant that totally destroy begin whitewash i have no particular desire to post it yet again brendan normally bdm
