from tclock tim clock subject re zionist leader frank statement in article odv aap alberto adolfo pinka write in article tclock tim clock write try come up with ymy own definition of any or all self-hating people to me any who reject their culture to the point where they only see the absolute negative of that culture generally or regard a particular event and accept only those view purely oppose aspect of that culture thu selective belief of historical fact and a complete ignore of context result hate their culture i believe that thing be get mix here critizicing israel be anti-zionist be not see the absolute negative of that culture if that culture refer to be israeli be anti-zionist can be see a a complete denial of that entity right to exist and it legitimacy just a say that islam ha no right to establish and implement a state that include any non-muslim both be absolute one-dimensional view of that culture with regard to the issue of state maybe because a person can see the positive of that culture be that that person oppose zionism and the action of the state of israel if that be the case one would expect a few of that culture positive to be discuss with regard to the issue at hand since the issue center on israeli culture i have yet to hear of any positive of that culture in thi discussion i for one consider the action of the state of israel with respect to the human right of the palestinian person a an example of an action thaty oppose what jewish culture wa suppose to uphold a an example of respect and what the jewish person learn about oppresion segregation and year in the diaspora i agree with you but i also feel that when a culture feel it be confront by another group that wish to see that culture disassemble the first culture ha little choice but to try to secure it survival a well a maintain it moral center since the culture be not about to turn away from either the matter of it survival or the value of it moral principle it ha the virtually impossible job of balance to discus israel fault and crime without any recognition of thi circumstance and reality it face be a consciou decision base on the discussant political bias not on an honest and empathetically open understand of the situation the same apply to those who attempt to paint the palestinian movement a all bad and dispense with consideration of the reality face them that certainly describe elia since he ha no intention of recognize that alongside the palestinian experience and perspective there exist also that of israeli he might not want to recognize that it do not make him a self-hating jew a far a i see it at most he be a person who be not tell the truth you beg the question by center on the symptom while the issue of self-hating address the motivation i certainly feel that anyone who expend so much effort inflate distort and rob human context from aspect of own culture be reflect a degree of dislike for it since bite of that culture be bind due to upbringing to be a part of a bite of self dislike seem likely to be mix in somewhere who be a jew a person whose integrity decay when unmoved by the knowledge of wrong do to other person a j heschel that be why i get move when i see the israeli army kill person in the occupied territory a much a i get move when i see a plestinian stab person in israel and thi be precisely why israeli society ha be tremendously harm by the action it it government ha felt it have to take in response to an other perceive a a threat just a with you there ha long be a strident and emotional debate about the pain israeli feel when force to balance desire for survival and moral belief the trauma of have to make that choice be make worse by the fact that neither can be conveniently brush aside a a result of a reason political debate for the sake of the other only reshape but so far it seem that the blame be alway put on the other if you read thi newsgroup for example israel be never guilty by herself she be alway respond to the action of the other and it go a if the action of isreal do not also affect the response of the other in a cycle that never end also there be blindnes to try to understand what the other feel and why a you well know thi proces of blame the other for the morally questionable action one side be force by the other of course to take be thoroughly practice by both side if you be only hear the pro-israeli crowd self-supporting argument that may be due to the fact that you be not listen for anything else i certainly hear the similarly distort element in thi newsgroup a well a in there be alway and excuse there be alway a rationale to explain why thing happen a they do and what be the worst part for me there seem to be all the time an intention to try to de-humanize the other a if the other do not care about their future child peace etc etc aap i agree agree agree agree however in my response to the initial discussion above between davidsson and those oppose hi presentation i saw davidsson carefully put academic frill around a blatantly one-sided series of them yesido yesido yesido i do not find the approach of those oppose davidsson to be center at all on a denigration and denial of the other side i certainly do wonder if the degree to which davidsson view on the middle east have distort be connect to hi dislike and rejection of hi jewish lineage having say thi however i agree with you that thi constant accuse other of be self-hating jew seem pointles it be not worse a label than be why you on their side except to perhap imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic biasednes tim tim clock student ucus tel department of politic and society fax university of californium irvine home tel irvine ca
