auditorium make a sound they be silent look at one another and gradually start to leave some guy a really fat one say ok we scar them enough let leave they leave slowly pompously it seem to me that

why do you come who send you here no one want you here have you kill person person yet what be you do here one of the soldier say do scream at u we muslim but we not from the sumgait polouse they call

worry i find you no matter where you be no matter what happen we go to the hospital there we be examine by a department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva i think her name wa she examine u the ambulance wa from baku i figure out that the sumgait ambulance have do anything they do respond to any call person call and neither the polouse nor the ambulance show any sign of life that doctor look me over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good have happen for she become quite glad i even think to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad be wrong she look me over and say now why be you suffer so you do know what ymy person have be do ymy person do even worse thing and i think great i have to deal with her and i felt so bad i think why do i just die so a not to have to hear more stuff like thi from person like her here i be in thi condition and be tell about something that my person do i just do have the energy to say how could my person possibly be smart enough to think of something that your have already do i stay there then they bring in another woman ira b she wa marry and she wa rap in her own apartment too there be three of u ira lyuda and the next morning they take lyuda and ira away they do do anything to help u thi wa in the old maternity home in the combine block they do do anything more than examine me that wa it i do want any shoot or tranquilizer nothing what shoot could have calm me down i do even want to look at them i lay in the ward either it just work out that way or they do it on pur pose but i wa alone i wa alone even though the ward be pack that same even a woman come by and ask me what wa wrong with me that my face wa disfigure she ask what have happen to me and i say better to ask ymy brother what happen there no point in ask me ymy brother can better explain what happen she fell into a faint all the doctor throw themself at her and the doctor categorically forbid anyone to come into my ward then person from work come to see me my bos hi daughter they bring me clothe because i wa literally naked the only thing i have on wa a dres but the woman who give it to me wa very short and the dres wa way up

come and bring me something in a sack apple i think three or fmy pound but i could take them i have become so weak that it wa just embarrass i say that i could take the apple and really do have any appetite no one have to bring me anything some woman take the sack and oh ye then i hear that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hide or tear up completely so that no one would know that i wa an armenian maybe they would figure it out from look at me so they must have be think that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be worse or perhap someone wa outside on the street i do know in any case i do sleep a wink that night the next morning they pick me up a whole polouse detail put me in a bu and off we go i do even know where they be take me they take me to the club where the troop be the very one i wa in that ill-fated even i get off the bu near the city party committee there be a great many troop tank armor personnel carrier the whole scene wa terrible i saw a few person i know there and that calm me a little i have already think that i wa the only one leave so there be five or six of u leave in sumgait after that night i still do know what happen to my parent they do come to see me in the hospital and my bos tell me that everything wa fine i do know whether to believe him or not maybe he wa just try to calm me down maybe something happen on the way then i go to the club and saw a lot of person i know they all know one another they be all kiss each other and ask what happen what go on two day later they come to see me from work they be there all the time each day they come show interest and be constantly bring me money they do everything they could of course i most thankful to my bos the only one of my colleague who do lose hi presence of mind and who do change hi opinion neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happen he constantly take an interest a sincere interest from the heart then about two day later the secretary of the party committee come not from my party organization but from the first trust which our be part of comrade kerimov a very important figure in my town he make arrangement with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if i sit down by myself i could get up or lie down again there wa something wrong with my lung it wa hard to breathe they examine me there several time there i lay be several doctor they all think that that it must just be from all the blow i do know they do diagnose anything in particular when i wa in the maternity home i even ask i make it a point of insist that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful there wa no way something inside wa break my rib well they take me there and take x-ray and say that everything wa fine there be emergency medical worker on duty in the club the mother of one of marina friend wa there she wa the head doctor at the sumgait child clinic they have every kind of antifever agent in the world which wa exactly what i need at that moment i think i say that i wa have great difficulty breathe i could seem to get enough air something wa wrong with me they put tight bandage around my chest and waist later i overhear some person say that i have be cut all over i think they just saw me be all bandage up and decide that my breast and face have be cut but i wa cut they take u to the khimik board house we live there a long time soon appear representative they be agitate at first person would not talk to them and drive them off one of the armenian woman shout we demand that seidov come the response wa it seidov who send u seidov be the chairman of the azerbaijani council of minister the woman say we only see seidov daughter have her come here we do the same thing to her that they do to my daughter and then we deal with you agitator and so on more of them say have seidov himself come thi go on day in day out the agitator keep come and come thi drive u out of my wit then person gradually start depart for yerevan because they realize it wa senseles to stay everything get on my nerve the smell the small child there be child at the sk club child who have literally just come out of the maternity home what be they do in a club that do even have run water all the time at first we have to pay to eat there they even overcharge u a it turn out on the second day someone tell u that they would bring u food for free the child be ill everything stink there well imagine about person in a small movie theater with seat for no more than you could sit or lie down it wa impossible to even move the stench wa awful even the smallest infant take ill overnight there i hear that they be arrive seriously ill in yerevan the infant they have to be wash they have to be bath not to mention that we the adult be ill and need care person be faint right and leave i just do know everyone wa cry everyone only the young person the man somehow manage to keep it together but the woman be in a constant state of panic it seem to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seem clear that we have be gather together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there would be a single armenian leave then person go up to the attic i do see them i only hear them because i wa lie down and could get up i lay right on the stage we have some room there apparently they catch two person with either oil or ga i think they want to burn the theater maybe someone saw them i do i wa in no condition to open my eye everyone wa suspiciou of everyone else they would ask are you an azerbaijani i think i saw you somewhere i think you an azerbaijani they lead out all the man and start let them back in by check their passport relative might be cover for each other half of the person do not have any document there be person who have run out of their home in nothing but a pair of pant and slipper or wear just a shirt not like they should have with their id so on the on sunday i think the polouse do nothing to help u on monday everything resume where it have leave off on block they do spare a soul there not child not pregnant woman nobody they kill they burn they hack with axe just everything possible they murder the melkumian family whom i know my mother work with them their daughter in-law go to school with my older sister they be brutally murder only the two daughter-in-law survive by a miracle one wa able to save herself she run away the neighbor would take her in so she run about the build until she find refuge she wa pregnant and have two small child thi all continue on monday in block on the when the troop be already in the city they murder person they overturn automobile and they burn entire family they say they do even know for sure if the person be armenian or not i hear that the lezgin suffer too i not sure myself i do see any lezgin who have be injure they burn car so it very difficult now to say exactly who die and who do it wa very difficult to identify the corpse or rather what remain of the corpse after they be douse in gasoline and burn it all very hard to imagine of course i hear that many person disappear without a trace from the btz plant two person include a woman who work the night shift aunt razmella who also live in microdistrict they be stop bus between baku and sumgait in the even person who have be visit baku be return to sumgait and person from baku be go home from sumgait and there be student too they be simply savagely murder they be stop the bus the driver immediately do what they be tell because there wa just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally mind person they stop the bus drag the armenian out and kill them on the spot i do see it myself but i hear that they put them all in a pile so a to burn them later it wa hard to discern from the corpse well you ca call them corpse you have to figure out from the ash who it wa l hear that two fellow save two woman one a student ira g if i not mistake she wa in the hospital a long time after that and she still ca figure out who save her she wa also brutally rap and beat and throw onto a pile of corpse the fellow pull her out of that whole pile of corpse put hi coat on her take her into hi arm and carry her to the city i still ca imagine how he manage to do that i hear that from engel grigorian he know her apparently well a lot of person go to that hospital anyway she wa in the hospital and sing a song in armenian and they write the word down and i think he still ha that piece of paper because he say that a lot of person now have that song the one she sing in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape they could find the guy who save her he leave her in someone apartment and call the ambulance she wa in such awful shape that probably like me she could remember anyone face i think that i know one of the person who break into my house maybe i have talk with him once but i receive so many blow everything wa just knock out of my head i ca remember to thi day who he wa then it seem i saw the secretary of the directorate party organization where marina work she go to school and work she go to night school at azi and work by day at the khimzashchitum construction and installation administration i the secretary of the komsomol organization at my administration and often meet with the secretary of party and komsomol organization we have joint meet i know them all i even talk with them and he i know be from armenium an azerbaijani but from armenium it become obviou that many of those person be azerbaijani bear in armenium they take me to variou polouse station to the polouse precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy get involve in the case and i iden tified the photograph of person who i could more or le recognize they show me the person who be in my apartment they work on my case but i ca even recognize them although it wa prove that they be the one they process it somehow they tell me that they know that someone hold me by the arm and someone else hold me by the leg when they be drag me there wa someone else in my apartment who do not even touch me he just steal a blanket and an earring or something like that all these person all of them a much a i hear about them and see them they be all from kafan the secretary of the party organization be name najaf najaf rzayev he wa there when everything start it must have be him because i do recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i know beside him all the more since i tell him listen you do something because you know me he turn away and go toward the bedroom where marina wa well you could see marina anyway there wa such a noisy confusion of person that you could make out anyone all of it fly right out of my head and then gradually i become myself again at the city party committee there be military person there i tell them what go on and they write it all down i tell them hi name on march the secretary of my first trust party organization the one we part of come to see u hi name be najaf rzayev i tell mamma if he here despite the fact that i give hi name it mean that either hi alibi ha be confirm or probably that they think i crazy not responsible for my word he say what do they do to you how awful myself i hide an armenian family then after some time go by he come back again and say something entirely different i wa at home my family and i go to baku i say marina what be he say he say something totally different before after that i do go to see my procurator my case be be handle by a procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov tell me that rzayev case have just get to him and there be so name involve what be they do with rzayev did he prove hi alibi or not they just think that since i wa hit in the head i ca say anything for sure whether it wa him or not it will be an insult if he wa in my apartment and do have to pay for it but at the same time i afraid to say i a hundred percent sure that it wa he because no mat ter who i name they tell me no you wrong he do do that that one wa there all the face have get mix up

balcony the mob throw her there and all of them run into the bedroom we have all kind of box with dish in them the dowry for all three sister they steal everything in the apartment leave only small thing at that moment lyuda come to and start remember everything well see the face hear the voice two person be say they could burn the apartment another say why burn the apartment when i get three kid and no place to live so thi guy wa in temporary house he do have anywhere to live he wa from sumgait they be sure that they would get the apartment beside the neighbor be azerbaijani why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijani that what they say how do they know there be azerbaijani there if they just pick a place think that armenian live there we have a list of the resident for my part of the build my name be in there but how could they know that azerbaijani live on the other side of the wall from u so they do set fire to my apartment i do know i wa in such bad shape that if all of it have come to a halt when i wa outside if someone have ask me what wa happen i would have say that a civil war wa go on well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they be beat me i open my eye and saw that all the neighbor be stand on their balcony and watch like at a free horror film so a civil war wa go on and only the armenian be be fight if it be a world war or something like that they would have be fight everyone but they only fight u then i meet some woman from my build some azerbaijani they be cry they tell me karina we saw all of it how could it happen they ask me well i just do know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happen to me i think that if it be the other way around either i would have be able to take it or i would have try to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman do in front of my build a woman life there an awful dissipate woman if you can call her a woman the dissipate life she lead two armenian family live there in her part of the build she come out on the balcony and saw what wa happen to me and start to scream and curse she come down to the entryway and say you come in thi entryway over my dead body so not one of them take it in hi head to go in that entryway some folk be say that those person be so out of control that they do even know what they be do i do think that true they know very well what they be do if they do even lift a hand against that woman they could have care le about her but the fact that she wa an azerbaijani stop them they be just beast they have smoke so much when they come to my place they be all chew something i notice everyone who come into the apartment wa chew something i think my god maybe i just think that maybe i lose my mind but no they all chew something maybe it be some kind of drug it must be because at first glance they all seem to be such normal person young clean-shaven look exactly a if they have come to some sort of celebration but they be shout something they do talk they shout a though there be deaf person there they scream and scream yeah kill kill we kill the armenian only they do shout kill they shout gurun ermianlary gurun

when i wa lie on the grind and all those person be stand on their balcony i do hear anyone voice no one say what be you do leave her alone mamma even tell one of the neighbor woman that if it have be

entryway an old sick woman try to stop the pogrom the azerbaijani have a custom if a woman take her scarf and throw it on the grind the man be suppose to stop immediately the old woman from the fourth entryway do that but they stomp her scarf into the grind push her off to the side and say if you want to go on live you disappear into ymy apartment so she leave that trick do work on them even the neighbor who help u move tell me ok fine calm down forget that it happen i say i only forget it if i tell them right then that it have happen to their daughter and if that do have any effect on them
