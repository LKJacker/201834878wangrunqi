from dbd david davidian subject seventh century armenian math problem from quantum magazine page the problem book of ananium of shirak on the ancient peak of ararat the century have come like second and pass on avetik issahakian by yurus danilov some year ago journalist interview celebrity like to ask them what book would you take with you if you be to go off on a space flight and though the number of book allow on the trip vary from to depend on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer and celebrity be person of the most vary taste age and profession not one of them dare to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problem some of these person certainly exclude thi kind of literature because they be train in the humanity and have nothing but scorn for number though secretly afraid of them other steer clear of such puzzle book because they be master of incomparably more difficult branch of modern mathematics and do mind say for all the world to hear that they do know how to solve mere arithmetic problem professional mathematician be no exception here what the russian mathematician alexander khinchin a specialist in statistic write about arithmetic i willingly confes that any time a fifth-grader ask me to help solve an arithmetic problem it wa a hard work for me and sometime i fail completely of course like most of my friend i could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route construct equation or set of equation but we be suppose to avoid use algebraic analysi at all cost by the way it a fact that be well know and oft repeat that a a rule neither high school graduate nor student at teach college nor teacher begin their career nor i must add scientific researcher can solve arithmetic problem it seem the only person in the world who be able to solve them be fifth-grade teacher now i not insist that a book of arithmetic problem be include in the bookbag of anyone fly into space but a sense of justice induce me to recommend one particular problem book one that will satisfy the most fastidiou taste and supply food for think sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the moon but for a extend space voyage say to venu and back one for the road they both take out the book they bring for the road kingsley glance at the royal astronomer book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroat shoot at each other with revolver god know what thi kind of stuff lead to think kingsley the royal astronomer look at kingsley book and saw the history of herodotu good lord next he be read thucydide think the royal astronomer fred hoyle the black cloud the book i talk about be very big but it problem constitute elegant miniature from seventh-century armenium naive and wise at the same time rich in strike detail and the bright coloration of the period these problem be reminiscent of the relief on the famou monument of armenian architecture the church on the island of akhtamar in lake van in what be now turkey they be a inseparable from the image of armenium a the elegant letter of the armenian alphabet invent by mesrop mashtot or the song of komita or the paint of saryan an edition of these incredibly beautiful problem ha long be a bibliographic rarity it wa publish under the title problem and solution of vardapet ananium of shirak armenian mathematician of the seventh century translate and publish by i a orbeli petrograd the abundance of close observation and wide-ranging information about the way of life and custom of that remote epoch when ananium of shirak live and work have actually render a disservice to hi problem book for many year the book wa know only to researcher in the humanity specialist in armenian history who jealously guard their treasure and would let just anyone see it even now after research by k p patkanov the learn monk father kaloust orbeli a abramyan v k chaloyan and other ha bring the work of ananium of shirak to light in scholarly circle the general reader remain ignorant of the very existence of thi remarkable problem book vardapet ananium of shirak once fell in love with the art of calculation i think that no philosophical notion can be construct without number consider it the mother of all wisdom ananium of shirak among ancient armenian thinker vardapet ananium of shirak stand out because of the breadth of hi interest and the unique mathematical orientation of hi work some of hi work have be preserve in addition to the problem and solution the follow tract have find a special place in the estimation of scholar on weight and measure cosmography and calendrical theory and armenian geography of the seventh century the authorship of the last work wa long attribute to another outstanding thinker of ancient armenium movse of khoren in hi autobiography ananium of shirak ha thi to say about himself i ananium of shirak have study all the science of my armenian land and have learn the holy scripture intimately in the expression of the psalmist every day i illuminate the eye of my mind feeling myself lack in the art of calculation i come to the conclusion that it be fruitles to study philosophy the mother of all science without number i could find in armenium neither a man verse in philosophy nor book that explain the science i therefore go to greece and meet in theodosiople a man name iliazar who wa well verse in ecclesiastical work he tell me that in forth armenium there live a famou mathematician christosatur i go thi person and spend six month with him but soon i notice that christosatur wa a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary fact i then go to constantinople where i meet acquaintance who tell me why do you go so far when much closer to u in trebizon on the coast of pontu life the byzantine vardapet tyukhik he be full of wisdom be know to king and know armenian literature i ask them how they know thi they answer we saw ourself that many person travel long distance to become pupil of so learn a man indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of constantinople philagru travel with u bring many young person to become pupil of tyukhik when i hear thi i express my gratitude to god who have quench the thirst of hi slave i go to tyukhik at the monastery of st eugene and explain why i have come he receive me graciously and say i praise my lord that he send you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of st gregory i be glad that all ymy country will learn from me i myself live in armenium for many year a a youth ignorance reign there vardapet tyukhik love me a a son and share all hi think with me the lord bestow upon me hi bless i completely assimilate the science of number and with such succes that my fellow student at the king court begin to envy me i spend eight year with tyukhik and study many book that have not be translate into my language for the vardapet have an innumerable collection of book secret and explicit ecclesiastical and pagan book on art history and medicine book of chronology why enumerate them by title in a word there be no book that tyukhik do not have and he have such a gift from the holy spirit for translate that when he sit down to translate something from the greek into armenian he do not struggle a other translator do and the translation read a if the work be write in that language originally tyukhik tell me how he have achieve such vast erudition and how he have learn the armenian language when i wa young he say i live in trebizon at the court of the military chief ioannu patricu and for a long time up to the accession of mauritiu to the throne i serve a a military man in armenium and learn ymy language and literature during one attack by persian troop on the greek i wa wound and escape to antioch i lose all my possession praying to the lord to heal my wind i make a promise if you prolong my life i shall dedicate it not to accumulate perishable treasure but to collect treasure of knowledge and the lord hear my prayer after i recover i go to jerusalem and from there to alexandrium and rome upon return to constantinople i meet a famou philosopher from athen and study with him for many year after that i return to my homeland and begin to teach and instruct my person after some year that philosopher die not find a replacement for him the king and hi courtier send for tyukhik and invite him to assume the teacher position tyukhik cite the promise he make to god not to move far from the city turn down the offer but because of hi wide lean person come stream from all country to study with him and i the most insignificant of all armenian have learn from him thi powerful science desire by king bring it to my country support by no one obligate only to my own industry god help and the prayer of the blessed educator and no one thank me for my effort problem and solution a half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the book be print on verge one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth on rag paper one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth on vellum and forty-five inscribe copy on dutch paper and so find how many copy be print in all imitation of ananium of shirak a latin proverb say habent sua fatum libelli book have their own fate the fate of problem and solution by ananium of shirak be quite amaze the manuscript of ananium book be preserve only because accord to armenian historian in ancient and medieval armenium manuscript be guard from invader like weapon and cherish like one own child biding their time the manuscript lay in the matenadaran a renowned depository of ancient manuscript now the mesrop mashtot institute of ancient manuscript and it hmy finally arrive in the learn monk father kaloust use two manuscript to publish the problem book supplement it with an introduction and commentary in the book wa translate into russian edit annotate and typeset by iosef orbeli a prominent scholar and later a member of the academy of science of the ussr in the translator word the problem of ananium be amuse full of life and simple orbeli go on to say the subject of the problem be generally take from everyday life the scene be predominantly hi homeland shirak and the surround countryside and the dramati persona if they be name be the local prince the kamsarakan include nersekh who wa a contemporary of ananium like other ancient author ananium of shirak use only aliquot that be fraction with a numerator of when it be necessary to write fraction with numerator other than one ha to represent it a a sum of aliquot see the epigraph above like any true work of art the problem of ananium suffer terribly in the retell you have to read the original albeit in translation in their full glory so let open ananium problem book a gift from acros the age problem and relate to the armenian uprise against the persian in problem my father tell me the follow story during the famou war between the armenian and the persian prince zaurak kamsarakan perform extraordinary heroic deed three time in a single month he attack the persian troop the first time he strike down half of the persian army the second time pursue the persian he slaughter one fourth of the soldier the third time he destroy one eleventh of the persian army the persian who be still alive number two hundred eighty flee to nakhichevan and so from thi remainder find how many persian soldier there be before the massacre problem during the famou armenian uprise against the persian when zaurak kamsarakan kill suren one of the armenian azat send an envoy to the persian king to report the baleful news the envoy cover fifty mile in a day fifteen day later when he learn of thi zaurak kamsarakan send rider in pursuit to bring the envoy back the rider cover eighty mile in a day and so find how many day it take them to catch the envoy problem mention vessel make of vary amount of metal in the russian translation they be all call dish but in the original armenian accord to orbeli note the dish in the first and second instance be call mesur and in the third instance scutel scutel be a common armenian word but mesur have not be encounter in armenian literature before ananium problem and solution problem there wa a tray in my house i melt it down and make other vessel from the metal from one third i make a mesur from one fourth another mesur from one fifth two goblet from one sixth two scutel and from two hundred ten dram i make a bowl and now find the weight of the tray several of the problem reflect the richnes of the caucasian fauna in ananium time for instance problem problem once i wa in marmet the capital of the kamsarakan strolling along the bank of the river akhuryan i saw a school of fish and order that a net be cast we catch a half and a quarter of the school and all the fish that slip out of the net end up in a creel when i look in the creel i find forty-five fish and now find how many fish here be in all the temptation be great to present all problem but i restrain myself and offer you just one more problem provide some interest information about the wild animal that inhabit armenium at one time but now extinct for so long that there be no mention of them even in zoological reference book the wild donkey accord to the generally accept view never roam the armenian land yet ananium of shirak offer evidence to the contrary problem the hunt preserve of nersekh kamsarakan ter of shirak and asharunik wa at the base of the mountain call artin one night great herd of wild donkey enter the preserve the hunter could not cope with the donkey and run to the village of talin tell nersekh about them when he arrive with hi brother and azat and enter the preserve they begin kill the wild beast half of the animal be catch in trap one fourth be kill by arrow the young which constitute one twelfth of all the animal be catch alive and three hundred sixty wild donkey be kill by spear and so find how many beast there be at the start of thi massacre set in type by me iosef orbeli hi biography could not be squeeze into the framework of a bibliography k uzbashyan academician iosef abgarovich orbeli anyone who be lucky enough to hold a copy of the small print n be the solution to the epigraph in the previou section of the russian translation of ananium of shirak problem and solution a thin book with yellow page ha probably notice the variety of the font the elegance of the border and the high quality of the design print and bind such great attention to detail be characteristic of work that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking and thi problem book wa indeed a kind of diploma attest to the professional maturity of the man who create it an advertisement at the end of the book read thi book wa typeset in december at the print office of the russian academy of science by me iosef orbeli the text wa also proofread lay out and decorate with border by me variou circumstance prevent me from carry thi project to the end the final page of the book be typeset by m strolman typesetting wa neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist iosef orbeli who later become the director of the hermitage museum in leningrad he wa also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith orbeli have already become acquaint with the famou academic print house typi academia found in and know all over the scientific world for it rich collection of font and it virtuoso typesetter in prepare to publish the corpu of ancient inscription preserve on the wall of armenian church orbeli find it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique sign and ligature thi complicate work wa do by m g strolman unfortunately the entire set of letter wa destroy during the blockade of leningrad in world war ius when orbeli come to the print office of the academy of science time be hard the only way to publish the newly translate problem of ananium wa for orbeli to learn typeset he have alway be attract to the printer craft in orbeli become the director of print at the academy of science even after he retire he remain a tireles champion of russian academic typography back to earth thi book by definition do not exhaust all the most important work in thi domain the editor hope that those who be guilty of thi incompletenes will read these line and sting by shame will work up if not a collection like thi at least a monograph v bonch-bruyevich introduction to the russian translation of solid-body symmetry by r knox and a gold let imagine a time when space flight be an everyday thing and high schooler will spend their break a astronaut-in train in the perelman crater on the far side of the moon maybe one of the space traveler will take thi very copy of quantum and another look over her shoulder will read thi article and say to himself thi ananium from shirak seem like a pretty interest guy when i get home i try to find hi problem good luck my young friend ananium be sure to entertain you perhap by then there will be more than n copy of hi timeles problem and solution and we can hope they will be a lovingly print a the masterpiece create by iosef orbeli
