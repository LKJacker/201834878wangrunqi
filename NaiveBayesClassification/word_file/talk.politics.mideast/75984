and their role in the fifteenth and sixteenth century klau schwarz werlag freiburg page during the fifteenth century when the ottoman be struggle to reestablish themself in the balkan there wa considerable turmoil among the jewish community in central and western europe even if the difficulty of the darker century immediately precede the fourteenth be minimize it be easy to understand the attraction which ottoman life particularly when compare to life in europe hold for the jew there be no way to tell how many jew leave christendom for the realm of the rise muslim ottoman but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from christian country it be record that some jew flee to ottoman territory the regularity of these report suggest that the ottoman be consider reasonably tolerant protector and that there wa a regular trickle of jewish family move southward and eastward from western and central europe it be evident that the effect of plague late crusade and the general intolerance and persecution of jew in christian europe result in the redirection of the whole focu of jewish life which for more than two century wa to be orient toward muslim east page in the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the edirne jewish community wa rabbi yitzhak sarfatus the ashkenazi chief rabbi of the city he wa the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tell u something of the situation of the edirne jewry in the fifteenth century sarfatus himself wa from christian europe and supposedly write thi letter at the behest of two recent arrival from there who upon see the prosperity and freedom of the ottoman jew prevail upon him to write their european coreligionist apprise them of the situation and urge them to migrate thi remarkable letter advise it recipient not only of the pleasant condition in the ottoman domain but describe a well the ease of travel to palestine and the holy place an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be bury there page the impression gain from the hebrew source be that the jew be firmly aware of the community of interest which exist between them and the ottoman especially in comparison to relation with the christian of europe confirmation of the commonality of interest between muslim and jew be also indicate by the fact that european christian perceive the jew a ally of islam and be well aware of muslim-jewish cooperation certainly the activity of important jewish financier and politician represent the ottoman government abroad do not pa unnoticed european source be the basi for much of my knowledge of their career in addition it appear that christian pirate plunder turk and jew their swear enemy and that european consider the jew to be agent who regularly report to the ottoman there be well-known example of overt jewish support for the ottoman in the struggle against european power the two best know instance of jewish support for the campaign ottoman be the frequently cite instance of the jewish contribution to the conquest of buda in the early sixteenth century and of rhode we also have report of sympathy for the ottoman during the siege of chio an unpublished ottoman document show dramatically the mutual interest which exist in some greek town page it be clear that throughout the sixteenth century it wa a generally accept fact that the interest of jew and muslim coincide frequently and all party involve jew muslim and christian be aware of the situation page it seem that the relation between greek and jew be not particularly cordial the two group have little in common few common interest and perceive no common philosophical or religiou tradition which could serve a the basi for cooperation rather than enmity if there wa any identifiable bond of good will which exist between religiou community in the fifteenth and sixteenth century it wa that between muslim and jew neither of whom have much in common with the orthodox page the general impression of muslim-jewish relation in the ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth century be one of community of interest from the earliest time the ottoman seem to have welcome jew to their territory and to have find in the community already exist in place which they conquer a cooperative element the jewish response to thi tolerance wa a steady flow of jew from christian country to ottoman domain page from the period before we have only a few indication that the ottoman-jewish relationship wa well on the course of amity which would characterize it for year afterward but the liberality of the ottoman in contrast to the intolerance of the byzantine and the protection and the security which the ottoman offer in comparison to condition elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the ottoman and the jew recognize their mutual interest page it be impossible to say how fundamental the jew be in the succes of the ottoman in rebuild istanbul or in ottoman mercantile succes in the sixteenth century that they play an important role in both can not be doupted it be also unclear whether they be important enough to say that the ottoman would not have experience their great succes without the jew and that no other group could have be find to serve the ottoman a well a do the jew it be however unmistakably clear that there be few parallel in world history to thi remarkable partnership between jew and the non-jewish society in which they live we must conclude that the ottoman could probably not achieve their succes without a group perform certain task for them a well a the jew do certainly for the jew of the fifteenth and sixteenth century the ottoman empire wa a most remarkable and salubriou home a version of rabbi sarfatus
