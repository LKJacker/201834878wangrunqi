from tclock tim clock subject re peace talk resume in article ohayon tsielohayon write in article tim clock write tc do you a i do agree that thi sort of peace proces be need tc what about the particular point mention in the article is what tc israel be supposedly go to propose good do it go too far tc not far enough tc if you do agree that a peace proces be need what be i personally think that a peace proces be need since only through negotiation will the future generation be able to live in stability unfortunately not all think like thi we have case like ana omran hamza saleh jle mohammed reza mehmed abu-abed anwar mohammed and other who think that jihad be the only solution if we ca avoid throw out gut-reaction to what we see a extremist view here in the newsgroup we certainly not go to be any better at it in the real world hey it easy here after read the offend post we can step back take some deep breathe exercise have a gallon of ice cream or sex whichever calmsu and reply in something other than the usual king-of-the-hill mentality my view be that israel ha make more gesture toward it arab fo than the opposite what have the sysrian give to u or propose what have the palestinian propose if the palestinian would just revoke or rewrite their charter or just condemn act of palestinian violence that would be a good start perhap start here with an immediate accusation be not a particularly good way to generate open response how about explain what you see a be israel real worry and how they need to be address since the other side see israel gesture in a completely different light than you do perhap they also have real worry from their point of view what be they how can those worry be address the palestinian have all to gain from these negotiation it seem though that they be not strong enough to make decision on their own and be plague by internal strife that be why we be not get anywhere fundamentalism be slowly take over in the territory then it will be too late to discus issue with the palestinian since they will only vow for the destruction of israel it be certainly much harder to reach compromise or even sit down and talk with an other side which be fracture into several different ideology each with it own set of demand while it be up to them to generate unity on their side be there anything that israel can do without sacrifice it security it position to encourage that unification along line that israel prefer arab must take example on egypt egypt come to the bargain table get what it want from israel and there be now peace and cooperation between the two country the tougher you play ball with israel the tougher israel get tsiel tim clock student ucus tel department of politic and society fax university of californium irvine home tel irvine ca
