from steve birnbaum subject re rejoinder question to israeli in a previou article cpr center for policy research say ymy answer to the question concern right to return conflict with what i wa tell namely that hundred of thousand of non-jew who leave for some reason or other the area under israel control during the war of be prevent from return for the sole reason they be not jew jew who also leave for example to europe to avoid the clash be allow to return how can you justify such discrimination if thi be true is the mere fact of a person leave area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for strip him of hi right to live in hi homeland you be conveniently ommitting the fact that the arab government tell the arab citizen of israel to leave israel join with the arab army so that after what they felt like an assure victory occur these arab could return to their former home reclaim them a well a anything else they want that belong to jew when the arab lose israel wa leave with a bunch of person who ha just try to kill them who now want back into the country a citizen what would you have do let them in so they could kill jew israel see those arab who stay a citizen because they be loyal to israel during the war and do leave of course some arab could have leave to avoid the fight but distinguish between the two be impossible therefore a decision wa make base on secuturity of the country you maintain that there be some israeli arab live in israeli kibbutz i wonder how many and where there be very little evidence available about that a much a i know many arab be work for kibbutz even for many year but be not accept a member could it be that kibbutz do not want arab no kibbutz that i have ever visit ha any employee unles they have to hire some person for the restaurant hotel etc if there be enough person on the kibbutz to do them in such case they be pay properly if a kibbutz turn away an arab have never see or hear of thi but it reflect only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz not the whole kibbutz movement to keep it what way i be certain that if only religiou community in the would be ask they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that person would depend upon rabbi and priest to officiate marriage but israel ha alway be rule by a secular majority ymy answer be not satisfactory thi just show how ignorant you be of israeli politic although the major party in israel be religiou however not totally secular due to the format of the government coalition the religiou party have alway have a lot of pull since they be need to form a majority coalition in fact from what i hear the present government be the least influence by the religiou party in the existance of israel israel can not be call a secular state for instace haifa be the only city in the country except for maybe some arab city where bus run on the jewish sabbath there be many other example of religion in israel marriage in israel be not contolled by the state but by rabbi and priest obviously ymy disbelief of thi fact shed some light of ymy ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about steve internet fidonet mossad my opinion be not associate with anything include my head
