from subject re saudi clergy and their western supporter v human right ilyes sez so how would have you defend saudi arabium and roll back the iraqi invasion be you in charge of saudi arabium all muslim know that the whole thing wa set up to destroy iraq not to liberate kuwait the person who be kill by the invasion be more many many more than the one that be kill by the iraqi in their smaller invasion i live in the west and i have see how ymy medium prepare you helples naive american for a war against no doubt you plan on exploit helples naive american for ymy own purpose hmm let see iraq even before the artificial conflict between iraq and kuwait that lead to the invasion a the cium correctly predict and pretend to be surprise not to know it just happen that saddam wa so predictible and so arrogant and stupid what would i have do most muslim would choose dead kuwaitis over dead iraqi and dead kuwaitis the first case would happen if no western intervention happen and the second case wa a direct or indirect result of western envolvement possibly if iraqi have indeed die but thi number be base on greenpeace estimate greenpeace have compromise it allege impartiality during the war by condemn the potential environmental consequence of allied miiltary action while initially completely ignore iraq horrible environmental crime start with the dump of million of barrel of oil into the gulf at ahmadi to the blow of over oil well what be the real number there ha be a lot of work on thi in the last two year none of it report a the greenpeace figure seem to get continuously bandy about the real number seem to be around on the same order a the number of kuwaitis kill torture and kidnap during the occupation i include an article i recently post below but thi be really old news independent television news report a figure around only a few month after the war but it wa hardly report for the ally to have kill iraqi they would have have to kill twice the total number of iraqi in kuwait the favor image of the hysteric be the last battle of the war at mutla thi wa yet another example of the american and european medium play into the hand of iraq and it de facto ally the destruction of the iraqi convoy at mutla wa portray a an all-out slaughter thi be simply not true the head and tail of the convoy wa bomb initially result in a lot of casualty at these point before bomber come back most of the rest of the iraqi soldier flee on foot furthermore ymy estimate of kuwaitus war dead if ally have invade be completely ridiculou you have acknowledge certainly implicitly that saddam be a barbarou brute you have acknowledge the hundred of thousand he ha be responible for kill in hi own country you know that the man he appoint a governor of kuwait ali majid wa hi most brutal henchman preside over the near genocide of the kurd in the late and more recently the yet when it come to hi treatment of kuwaitis he be an angel in ymy estimate he would kill fewer than he already have when the war start what a joke apn iraq war dead copyright the associated pres all right reserve by nick ludington associated pres writer washington ap after the persian gulf war end the world wa tell that a many a iraqi soldier be kill at one point even baghdad put the toll that high a do the defense intelligence agency in private but official have be backpedal ever since even though the pentagon ha yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public now one former dium analyst say the number of iraqi troop kill may have be a low a that conclusion by john heidenrich write in the current issue of the quarterly magazine foreign policy represent the lowest estimate yet from defense source the revision suggest a le devastate iraqi toll fit a pattern of vastly moderate military claim in the month after the war end claim for a number of weapon also be scale down despite the dramatic videotape of successful weaponry or the shock picture of iraq disastrou retreat from kuwait argument have continue unabated about what really happen in the gulf war heidenrich be not the first to question the iraqi death toll number that originally be air more that a year ago air force lt gen charle horner the commander of the air campaign in the gulf war say he believe the iraqi military death toll wa fewer than for the entire war the pentagon itself still refuse to provide an estimate of the number of iraqi who die in the war against the coalition in january and february on monday pentagon spokesman lt cmdr joe gradisher reiterate past statement that there just be a number that be credible but some current internal estimate range from to iraqi troop kill say one analyst speak on condition of anonymity who be familiar with the pentagon report allied death be put at american by friendly fire british by american fire frenchman italian and among variou arab ally of the postwar reassessment the most widely publicize wa the army reluctant acknowledgement month later that it tout patriot air defense system wa nowhere near so effective a claim against iraq scud missile the bush administration initially claim an almost perfect record for the patriot last spring it revise the hit ratio to percent the succes record of the navy tomahawk high-tech cruise missile use against target in baghdad and other part of iraq also turn out to be more modest than initially indicate by the pentagon the first iraqi casualty figure to surface after the war come in a may report by the environmental group greenpeace which say to iraqi soldier be kill it estimate that to iraqi civilian be also kill the same month publish report say the defense intelligence agency estimate iraqi soldier be kill and wound in the air and grind campaign although the agency qualify that by say the estimate could be off by a much a percent in either direction but a more information become available those figure gradually be revise downward the house armed service committee staff estimate dead and wound after a review last year but heidenrich write in the current issue of the quarterly foreign policy estimate the total death toll from both the air and grind offensive a low a with about wound heidenrich base the conclusion in hi article on the number of body find and bury by troop and on prisoner of war interview he note that only about of iraqi prisoner of war be wound based on the calculation that about half a many wound escape a be capture he put the number of wound at about using a conservative ratio of one dead to two wound applicable to third world army like iraq he set battlefield death at maybe the figure be too low he write maybe the real death toll on the battlefield wa or or even even then the evidence suggest a death toll of well below or even in an interview he say the figure wa obviously off base because it would mean that virtually all the iraqi soldier in the kuwait theater of operation be casualty he say today bloodiest war be not those fight with high technology but rather the drawn-out conflict such a those in yugoslavium and somalium
