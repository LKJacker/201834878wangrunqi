from benali ilyes b bdira subject re the israeli pres mark ira kaufman write for ymy information on israel since i read both american medium and israeli medium i can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the american pres for knowledge about israel do not have a true picture of what be go on of course you never read arab medium i read arab israeli jer post and thi network be more than enough and western american french and british report and i can say that if we give israel and arab on the bia scale of course you can switch the polarity israeli newspaper will get either a or american lead newspaper and tv news range from to ye there be some that be more israeli than israeli the montreal suburban a local free newspaper probably be closer to kahane view than some israeli right wing newspaper british range from neutral to french that iknow of of course range from afro-french magazine to arab official medium range from to egyptian to in sa why no because they do not want to overdo it and stir person against israel and therefore against them since they be do nothing a to the claim that israeli paper be bias of course they be some may lean to the right or the leave just like the medium here in america but they still report event about which person here know nothing i choose to form my opinion about israel and the mideast base on more knowledge than do an average american who rely exclusively on an american medium which do not report on event in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy the average bia of what you read would be probably around while that of the average american would be the same if they do not read or read the new-york time and similar news-maker and if they read some other relatively le bias newspaper so you be not better off
