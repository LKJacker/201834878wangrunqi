from center for policy research cpr subject unconventional peace proposal from center for policy research cpr subject unconventional peace proposal a unconventional proposal for peace in the middle-east by elia davidsson the follow proposal be base on the follow assumption fundamental human right such a the right to life to education to establish a family and have child to human dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc be more important to human existence that the right of state in the event of a conflict between basic human right and right of collectivity basic human right should prevail between the collectivity define themself a jewish-israeli and palestinian-arab however label an unresolved conflict exist thi conflict ha cause great suffer for million of person it moreover poison relation between community people and nation each year the united state expend billion of dollar in economic and military aid to the conflict party attempt to solve the israeli-arab conflict by traditional political mean have fail a long a the conflict be perceive a that between two distinct which claim the land there be no just nor peaceful solution possible love between human be can be capitalize for the sake of peace and justice when person love they share having state my assumption i will now state my proposal a fund should be establish which would disburse grant for each child bear to a couple where one partner be israeli-jew and the other palestinian-arab to be entitle for a grant a couple will have to prove that one of the partner posse or be entitle to israeli citizenship under the law of return and the other partner although bear in area under current isreali control be not entitle to such citizenship under the law of return for the first child the grant will amount to for the second the third child for each child for each subsequent child the grant will amount to for each child the fund would be finance by a variety of source which have show interest in promote a peaceful solution to the israeli-arab conflict include the government jewish and christian organization in the and a great number of government and international organization the emergence of a considerable number of marriage in all of whom would have relative on side of the divide would make the conflict lose it ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society the existence of a strong stock of person would also help the integration of israeli society into the middle-east in a graceful manner objection to thi proposal will certainly be voice i will attempt to identify some of these the idea of provide financial incentive to select form of partnership and marriage be not conventional however it be base on the concept of affirmative action which be recognize a a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effect of segregation and discrimination international law clearly permit affirmative action when it be aim at reduce racial discrimination and segregation it may be object that the israeli-palestinian conflict be not primarily a religiou or ethnical conflict but that it be a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenou colonize society that can only regain it freedom by arm struggle thi objection be base on the assumption that the be not zionism a ideology and practice but israeli-jewish society and it member which will have to be defeat thi objection ha no merit because it do not fulfill the first two assumption concern the primacy of fundamental human right over collective right see above fundamentalist jew would certainly object to the use of financial incentive to encourage marriage from their point of view the continue existence of a specific jewish person override any other consideration be it human love peace of human right the president of the world jewish congres edgar bronfman reflect thi view a few year ago in an interview he give to der spiegel a german magazine he call the increase assimilation of jew in the world a calamity comparable in it effect only with the holocaust thi objection ha no merit either because it do not fulfill the first two assumption see above it may object that only a few person in would request such grant and that it would thu not serve it purpose to thi objection one might respond that although it be not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal the existence of such a fund would help mix couple to resist the pressure of their respective society and encourage young couple to reject fundamentalist and racist attitude it may object that such a fund would need great sum to bring about substantial demographic change thi objection ha merit however it must be remember that huge sum more than billion be expend each year by the united state government and by organization to maintain an elusive peace in the middle-east through armament a mere fraction of these sum would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate toward the existence of marriage in thu encourage the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land i would be thankful for critical comment to the above proposal a well for any dissemination of thi proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment elia davidsson post box reykjavik iceland
