campaign bullock however never do go back gerard also seem to have have a close relationship with mossad which may have start in when he go on an adl junket to israel the adl frequently sponsor trip for american law enforcement official to israel where they be win and din and meet their counterpart in variou intelligence agency according to an affidavit by san francisco polouse inspector roth the all-expense pay trip to israel wa more or le a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the adl to continue the close relationship it ha with specific law enforcement officer from the united state gerard may have like what he saw in israel a short time after travel there he go to addi ababa where he help with mossad rescue of ethiopian jew a gerard relationship with south africa deepen he talk more openly about hi exploit in the cium bullock recall gerard mention that he have be in algerium on cium busines and that gerard discuss the plo and say the fbi report to thi louie once respond that israeli intelligence have determine that the plo and the african national congres be cooperate gerard also speak of have travel with the cium to afghanistan louie also tell gerard and bullock about hi adventure inside south africa a an intelligence officer both gerard and louie trade story and regale each other and bullock with tale of scrape although there be still much mystery about what trigger law enforcement investigation of the adl it wa probably the theft of a classify fbi report on the nation of islam from the fbi san francisco office polouse arm with search warrant recover the report in the adl san francisco office gurvitz say he have send a copy of it to mira boland the director of the adl fact find division in washington boland wa prepare an op-ed piece for the washington time in which she argue that the nation of islam should not receive federal fund for the reconstruction of because the group be anti-semitic and violence-prone boland who have arrange the adl polouse junket to israel attend by gerard testify in a criminal trial in roanoke virginium that she have work for the cium for month and later wa a subcontractor for the defense department before join the adl during the trial boland admit to share information with a cium official at an invitation only adl conference after he wa question by the fbi last fall gerard flee to the philippine which ha no extradition treaty with america gerard be believe to have supply information from polouse computer not only to the adl but to israel and south africa a well the san francisco examiner report that gerard may be charge with violate federal espionage law although bullock work for the adl for year and irwin suall praise him in a july memo a my number one investigator the adl now argue that he wa a rogue agent in it own defense the adl also assert that it fact finder operate no differently than journalist after all ask adl official do journalist keep file but the difference between the practice of journalism and the adl method of gather information could be more strike journalist place information in the public domain where they be hold accountable for falsehood distortion and libel and for the most part journalist do share their investigative file with foreign and domestic polouse agency the adl ha no such inhibition because many of it file be not open to public scrutiny false information collect by ideologically bias researcher can not be correct once a proud human right group the adl ha become the jewish think polouse the adl say it a human right group not just for jew but for everyone say chip berlet a highly respect researcher at the massachusetts-based political research associate which monitor right-wing extremist group that fine but it ca do that and spy on palestinian it blatantly unethical and frankly immoral my argument to person be that the adl wear fmy hat each of the hat independently be appropriate it be a broad-based human right group that look at the broad issue of prejudice and discrimination it be a group that defend jew against defamation entirely noble nothing wrong with that hat it be a group whose leader at least consistently defend the action of israel against it critic which again be entirely appropriate and it be a group that maintain an information-sharing arrangement with law enforcement again there be nothing wrong for a group to do that but you ca do all fmy it be impossible to do all fmy and not violate the bind of ethic there a built-in conflict of interest if you wear all fmy hat adl national director abraham foxman apparently see no such conflict in a september letter to the voice foxman complain adl ha a proud record of fight bigotry and promote civil right and constitutional freedom any imputation of an effort or motive on my part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone be false and baseles throughout hi piece on aipac spy friedman describe the dissemination of information a if it be slander and the existence of file a a token of mccarthyite inclination the depiction be mislead in several way virtually every journalist academic politician and organization keep file on subject they deem relevant trace the logic of friedman reckles charge the library of congres be tantamount to the kgb moreover disseminate the public record of a public figure be neither defamation nor mccarthyism but many believe the adl be increasingly in the defamation busines ask jesse jackson jame abourezk or the leader of the new jewish agenda all past target of adl smear at the same time the adl exonerate the fascist world anti-communist league which assist ronald reagan covert war against nicaragua a policy endorse by adl leader in the early researcher rus bellant and berlet ask to meet fact find head irwin suall to discus their work on anti-semite lyndon larouche my view then of irwin suall wa that he wa thi really terrific investigator say berlet so we introduce ourself say what we be up to and suall lean back in hi chair and basically run down a dossier on each of u about what my political activity be who we work with what organization we belong to obviously he wa just try to blow u away and he succeed admirably we be just sit there with my mouth open feel very uncomfortable and then he lean forward and say right-wing be the problem the left-wing be the problem the soviet union be the biggest problem in the world for jew it the american leave that be the biggest threat to american jew you on the wrong track you part of the problem we be stun i wa virtually in tear thi be not how i perceive myself we basically stumble out of there in a daze letter response to friedman article the village voice may vol xxxviius no a league of hi own robert i friedman assault on the anti-defamation league the antus defamation league is spying on you may demonstrate that he ha an axe to grind and hi own prejudice and bias agenda to promote it also demonstrate that concern for accurate report be far down on hi list the story be replete with inaccuracy innuendo and outright falsehood and convey a picture of adl so divorce from reality a to be farcical friedman be even wrong on such basic easily determine fact a where adl wa found chicago not new york and the build in which adl san francisco office be locate not the jewish community federation build picture adl ha do the work of fight hater for year without spy on organization or individual and with profound respect for the law my mission be to monitor and expose those who be antus jewish racist anti-democratic and violence-prone and we monitor them primarily by read publication and attend public meet through the year we have publish score of report on antus semitism emanate from both the leave and the right in fact although friedman bia lead him to assume the contrary adl primary concern be still the far right because extremist organization be highly secretive sometime adl can learn of their activity only by use undercover source friedman hyperbole notwithstanding these source function in a manner directly analogou to investigative journalist some have perform great service to the american person for example by uncover the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary train camp with no recognition and at considerable personal risk the information adl obtain be place in the public domain and through the year adl ha establish a reputation for accurate report friedman article by contrast contain so much misinformation that it would take an article equally a long to set the record straight a few example he state that an adl leader wa deeply involve in the jonathan pollard israeli spy operation and that pollard handler wife work for the new york adl a a lawyer not true friedman also state adl investigator in unmarked van videotape palestinian funeral not true elsewhere he assert that adl wa obsess with spy on anti-apartheid activist again not true we could go on and on and of course friedman do not reveal hi source the distortion game friedman play when he mention number further reveal hi lack of objectivity when it come to how much adl pay roy bullock a week a an independent contractor not an employee an important distinction friedman also fail to make he include the zero invite the reader to see a large number by contrast when he observe that adl pay bullock nearly between and he choose not to point out that amount to little more than a year hardly an excessive sum what be accurate about friedman story be chip berlet description of adl fmy hat ye adl look at broad issue of prejudice and discrimination ye adl defend israel against critic and ye adl maintain an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement regard extremist activity and hate crime we see no conflict in these fmy activity and we believe most voice reader wo either abraham foxman national director anti-defamation league manhattan robert i friedman reply for the adl to compare itself to investigative journalist be absurd journalist do spy on arab and anti-apartheid activist and then freely pa their file to south african and israeli intelligence but accord to polouse the confession of two pay adl investigator buttress by page of court document and interview the adl do indeed the adl spy on group that be neither anti-semitic nor violent polouse confiscate adl file on hundred of mainstream group range from act up to peace now respected intellectual and middle east scholar who disagree with the adl political view have end up on adl blacklist their reputation smear private organization have no busines pay operative inside polouse department or have spy say an april editorial in the st loui post-dispatch condemn adl spy on april polouse arm with search warrant raid adl office in san francisco and after conclude that adl employee be apparently le than truthful in voluntarily turn over document during an earlier search accord to san francisco polouse inspector ron roth swear affidavit roth also assert that bullock wa a pay employee for the adl if so by fail to pay taxe on of income pay to bullock the adl could face a total of felony count accord to court paper the adl may also face felony charge for illegally obtain confidential information from polouse computer a for error the adl wa found in chicago and move to new york in but it wa an original tenant in the san francisco build show in the voice photo move out a few month ago i never write that an adl leader wa deeply involve in the pollard israeli spy operation i report that pollard himself make the charge and in court paper pollard own lawyer say that the wife of pollard handler work for the adl if i have a bia it be on the side of the first and fourth amendment
