from shaig shai guday subject re wa go hezbollah in article basil hamdan write in article shaig shai guday write that be what be so hard of south lebanon israel be not fight an army with well draw battle line but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blend with the local populace not because they be evil coward that use woman and child a shield but because that be the only way one can fight a more powerful better equip occupy army while that be currently true from their perspective it be also worthwhile to note that in such case the populace often do suffer from attempt to control the guerilla furthermore there be case in the past of palestinian gun emplacement be situate within village the argument that can be make for small arm fire can not be make for field piece hizbollah and amal be now the main two militia though hizbollah person tend to be more commit to resistrance operation and better motivate by religiou conviction a i recall amal wa primarily nationalistically lebanon for the lebanese motivate i think that the difference between them wa also a matter of fund and support one question do come to mind however given that you claim the hizbollah to be more commit etc and that their state position be no peace talk no peace talk no peace talk n no israel if we assume that lebanon and syrium be sincere in their desire for peace why ha the hizbollah be disarm i hope you be right on israeli willingnes to withdraw but i still contend that withdrawal would be the better course for israel security since it would reduce it military loss and i claim that the lebanese and syrian would be able to prevent any further attack on northern israel bearing in mind the above and that military loss be more palatable than civilian one i be sure you can understand why israel be slow to act in that manner no the syrian be more than happy to have israel sink into another lebanese moras i could elaborate if necessary hmm here we disagree on what serve syrium interest better i think syrium want to have lebanon all to itself it would be will to guarantee northern israel security in return for israeli withdrawal i do think syrium want israel to be involve in it protectorate of lebanon syrium be sit at the negotiate table because it ha come to accept that and want to get a political resolution a renewal of hostility along the lebanese front could put the whole me peace negotiation back in question i agree that syrium want lebanon to be part of it greater syrium i do necessarily see that the syrian would be unhappy to see israel up to it neck in another lebanese moras afterwhich syrium could continue on it merry schedule when israeli public opinion would lead to a second pullout i agree that the los of any human life be deplorable and regrettable sigh why ca some negotiate a easily a some person shai guday stealth bomber o software engineer thinking machine corp the wing ninja of the sky cambridge ma
