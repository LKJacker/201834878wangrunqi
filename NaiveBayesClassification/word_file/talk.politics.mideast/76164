from tclock tim clock subject re wa go hezbollah in article hernlem brad hernlem write in article tclock tim clock write are you suggest that when guerilla use the population for cover israel should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attack another be to use an innocent a a shield and hope that the other respect innocent life tell me tim what be these guerilla do wrong assuming that they be use civilian for cover assuming also come on brad if we be go to get anywhere in thi or any discussion it do help to bring up element i never address nor comment on in any way i make no comment on who be right or who be wrong only that civilian are be use a cover and that have be place in between the israeli and the guerilla they will be injure a both party continue their fight the purpose of an army use of military uniform be to set it member apart from the civilian so that civilian will not be think of by the other side a combatant so what do you think be the mean behind the intention and the effect when an army purposely do not be uniform but go out of it way to look like civilian they be judge that the benefit they will receive from thi cover be more important that the harm that will come to civilian thi be a comment on the israeli experience and be say that the guerilla do have some responsibility in put civilian in the middle of thi fight by put on uniform and live apart from civilian barrack etc the guerilla would significantly lower the risk to civilian but if the guerilla do thi be they put themself at greater risk absolutely they ask themself why set ourself apart by wear uniform when there be a ready-made cover for u civilian that make sense from their point of view but when thi cover be use the guerilla should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilian if the buffer zone be to prevent attack on israel be it not work why be it further neccessary for israeli gun to pound lebanese village why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there be more to the shell of the village it be call retaliation getting back getting even it do make sense to shell the village the least it show be a reckles disregard by the israeli government for the life of civilian i agree with you here i have alway think that israel bomb sortee and bomb policy be stupid thoughtles inhumane and ineffective but there be no reason that israel should passive wait until attacker choose to act there be every reason to believe that take the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attack a i say previously israel spend several decade sit passively on it side of a border and only act to stop these attack after the attacker have enter israeli territory it do work very well the host arab state do to try and stop these attack from it side of the border with israel so the number of attack be considerably higher a wa their physical and psychological impact on the civilian catch in their path what so the whole bite about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for thi to happen it will only occur when arab state show that they be prepare to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratee there be no way israel be go to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance toward anti-israel guerilla in-residence if israel be not will to accept the word of other then imho it ha no busines waste other time come to the peace talk thi be just another selectively apply statement the reason for thi drawn-out impasse between and israeli be that neither side be will to accept the word of the other by ymy criterium everyone should stay away from the negotiation that be precisely why the palestinian in their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiation and lead up to full autonomy be demand condition that essentially define autonomy already they do not trust that israel will follow through the entire proces and allow palestinian to reach full autonomy do you understand and accept thi viewpoint by the palestinian if you do then why should israel view of be any different why should they trust the word since they do they be very reluctant to give up tangible asset land control of area in exchange for word for thi reason they be also concern about the sort of guarantee they will have that the arab will follow through on their part of any agreement reach but do you see that the same statement can be make both way if lebanon wa interest in peace then it should accept the word of israel that the attack be the cause for war and disarm the hizbollah will remove the cause for it continue occupancy absolutely so be the ask first for the israeli word in relation to any agreement no what be be demand first be land when the issue be land and one party finally get hold of thi land what the other party do be totally irrelevent if i now have possession of thi land ymy word have absolutely no power whether israel choose to keep it word do not get the land back afterall israel ha already stag two part of the withdrawal from area it occupy in lebanon during slg tim you be ignore the fact that the palestinian in lebanon have be disarm hezbollah remain the only independent militium hezbollah do not attack israel except at a few time such a when the idf burn up sheikh mosavus hi wife and young son while the major armament those allow person to wage civil war have be remove the weapon need to cross-border attack still remain to some extent rocket attack still continue and commando raid only require a few easily conceal weapon and a refine disregard for human life your of that of other such attack also continue of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinate person and shell village they would make the lebanese so mad a to do that bat guano the situation you call for exist in the and attack be commonplace furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarm it would not be possible there be no way these group can be effectively disarm unles the state be a authoritarian be syrium the only other way be for lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel essentially mirror israel border secirity on it side it ha to prove to isreal that it be thi commit to protect israel from attack from lebanese territory once syrium leaf who be to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syrium stay thay may be even more dangerou for israel tim when be the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border not lately eh that what i say ok but do that mean that syrium ha to take over lebanon i do think israel or lebanon would like that what both side need be to receive something tangible the arab palestinian be look for land and demand that they receive it prior to give anything to israel israel ha two problem if it gife up real land it is expose itself to a change geostrategic situation and that change do help israel position and when it gife up thi land it need to receive something in return to compensate for the increase risk tim
