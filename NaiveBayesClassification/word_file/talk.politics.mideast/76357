from shaig shai guday subject re rejoinder question to israeli in article center for policy research cpr write from center for policy research cpr subject rejoinder question to israeli to shaig subject ten question to israeli dear shai in the answer to my first question concern the nonexistence of israeli nationality ymy answer conflict with information i have receive from other quarter accord to which there be two distinct category of classify israeli citizenship ezrahut and nationality the former be use on passport etc and the later for daily identification in israeli society i be tell that person in israel have to carry their id card at all time and present them at many public place almost every day these id card make clear who the holder be a jew or an arab you maintain that thi mainly because of religiou service provide but do you really believe that thi be the reason could you provide evidence that thi be the case and that it serve no other purpose a number of point you be make assumption about the manner in which the card be use true by law all resident citizen and tourist must carry a form of identification with them for citizen the standard id be the id card the purpose thi serve on a daily basi wherein they be present at public place be for the purpose of identify the bearer thi take place in bank cash check post office register mail and such etc quite frankly it wa rare that i ever have to present my id card for such activity more than once per week there be no law or requirement that force person to wave their id card in public furthermore none of the service i outline discriminate against the bearer in any manner by have acces to thi information the only case that i can think of in which the field might be take into account be during interaction with the polouse base upon the scenario in general though arab citizen be clearly recognizable a be non-arab ymy argument therefore become moot unles you can provide an example of how thi field be be use to discriminate against them officially in the answer to my second question concern the fact that israel ha no fix border you state that israel border be and reshape by both war and peace according to what i read the first zionist in the begin of the century have plan for the jewish state to extend into what be lebanon and into transjordan jordan i also read that it wa the expres wish of ben-gurion to not declare israel border when israel wa establish a thi might restrict israel opportunity for later expansion israel often claim it right of existence on the fact that jew live there year ago or that god promise the land to them but accord to biblical source the area god promise would extend all the way to iraq and what be the border in biblical time which israel consider proper to use today finally if israel want peace why ca it declare what it consider it legitimate and secure border which might be a base for negotiation having all the above fact in mind one can not blame arab country to fear israeli expansionism a a number of war have prove i take issue with ymy assertion i think that arab country do know that they have nothing to fear from israeli expansionism militarily israel be not capable of hold onto large tract of land under occupation to a hostile arm and insurgent population for a sustain period of time a be the intifada be heavily tax the israeli economy proof of thi can be see in the israeli withdrawal from lebanon israeli troop pull back from the awali and later from the litani in order to control the minimal strip need to keep town out of range of katyusha missile fire public opinion in israel ha turn toward settle the intifada vium territorial concession the israel public be sufferring from battle fatigue of sort and the be aware of it with regard to border let me state the follow i may not agree with the manner in which negotiation be be hold however the crux of the matter be that everyone either make or refrain from state a start position the arab party have call for total withdrawal and a return to border if israel be to state large border the negotiation might never get under way if israel be to state smaller border then the arab country might try and force even smaller border during the negotiation i think that leave the matter to be settle by negotiation and peace treaty be infinitely more realistic and sensible ymy answer to my third question be typical of a stalinist public official i do think ymy answer be honest you refer me to vanunu revelation about israel nuclear arsenal without evaluate the truthfullnes of hi revelation now if he say the truth then why should he be punish and if he lie why should he be punish i would appreciate more honesty ymy statement be typical of the simple mind naivety of a center for policy research whether or not all of vanunu revelation be true ha no bear on the fact that some be for disclose state secret after have sign contract and form with the understand that say secret be not to be make public one should be punish a to which be and which be i be under no moral obligation to disclose that quite the reverse in fact he wa take to court try and find guilty you may take issue with a number of thing but clearly you have no understand of the concept of secret of state something which every democratic govt ha somebody provide an answer to the fourth question concern prisoner in israeli prison he post an article from document such case it seem that such prisoner do exist in israel what do you think about that i notice that he wa document the fact that such prisoner could exist more than he document the fact that they do exist the clu note which you evidently do not pay attention to that they know of no such report or case i be sorry to tell you but in a country of mill a tightly knit a israel even if the matter of the arrest wa not make public within a relatively short time frame most person would know about it my own feel be that the matter of the arrest should be make public unles a court order be issue allow a delay of x hour thi would be grant only if a judge could be convince that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation you imply that my question show bia and be formulate in such a way to aspersion upon israel such term have often be use by the soviet union against dissident they call the soviet union into disrepute if my question be not disturb they would not call forth such hysterical answer my question be clearly provocative but they be mean to seek fact i would be very happy if you could convince me that what i be tell about israel be just fabrication but ala you have fail to do so i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion thi be a sign of weaknes not of strength well i be sorry to say that ymy question be slant such question be often term tabloid journalism and be not disturb because they avoid any attempt at objectivity such question be often use during the mccarthy era a a basi for the witch-hunt that take place then to use ymy own example these question might have be lift from the format use by stalinist prosecutor that be look for small bite of evidence that they could distort and portray a a larger and dirtier picture my answer be not any more hysterical than the question themself the problem be not that the q be provocative it wa that they be selective in their fact seek you fall into the same category of those who seek ye no answer when the real answer be of sort i suspect that a long a the answer to these question be not an unequivocal no you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them a you see fit a sign of strength be the ability to look you remind me of those mistake environmentalist who once advocate cull wolf because of the cruelty to deer only to find that they have break the food chain and wreak havoc upon the very environment they seek to protect the color blindnes you exhibit be a true sign of weaknes i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth ditto shai guday stealth bomber o software engineer thinking machine corp the wing ninja of the
