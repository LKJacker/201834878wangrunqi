from tclock tim clock subject re wa go hezbollah in article hernlem brad hernlem write in article tclock tim clock write assuming also come on brad if we be go to get anywhere in thi or any discussion it do help to bring up element i never address nor comment on in any way i make no comment on who be right or who be wrong only that civilian are be use a cover and that have be place in between the israeli and the guerilla they will be injure a both party continue their fight pardon me tim but i do not see how it can be possible for the idf to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for plant the bomb which kill the three idf troop and then later know the exact number and whereabout of all of them several village be shell how could the idf possibly have know that there be guerrilla in each of the targetted village you see it wa an arbitrary act of retaliation i will again repeat my statement i do not condone these indiscriminate israeli act nor have i ever if the villager do not know who these guerilla be which you state earlier how do you expect the israeli to know it be very difficult to identify who they be thi be why the guerilla prefer to lose themself in the general population by dress the same act the same etc the host arab state do to try and stop these attack from it side of the border with israel the problem tim be that the original reason for the invasion wa palestinian attack on israel not lebanese attack i agree but because lebanon wa either unwilling or unable to stop these attack from it territory should israel simply sit quietly and accept it situation israel ask the lebanese government over and over to control thi third party state within lebanese territory and the attack keep occur at what point do israel or any state have the right to do something itself to stop such attack never while the major armament those allow person to wage civil war have be remove the weapon need to cross-border attack still remain to some extent rocket attack still continue and commando raid only require a few easily conceal weapon and a refine disregard for human life your of that of other such attack also continue ye i be afraid that what you say be true but that still do not justify occupy ymy neighbor land israel must resolve it dispute with the native palestinian if it want peace from such attack it be also the responsibility of any state to not allow any outside party to use it territory for attack on a neighbor state if angola have the power and south africa refuse or could stop anti-angolan guerilla base on sa soil from attack angola and south africa refuse to have un troop station on it territory between it and angola would angola be justify in enter sa if not be you say that angola had to accept the situation do nothing and absorb the attack bat guano the situation you call for exist in the and attack be commonplace not true lebanese be not attack israel in the with a strong lebanese government free from syrian and israeli interference i believe that the border could be adequately patrol the palestinian heavy weapon have be siezed in past year and i do not see a significant a threat a once exist i refer above at all time to the palestinian attack on israel from lebanese soil not to lebanese attack on israel one hope that a lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol it border but there be no reason to believe it will be any stronger what ha changed be that the plo wa largely drive out of lebanon not by the lebanese not by syrium and that be by far the most important make it easier to control future palestinian attack from lebanese soil that change wa bring about by israeli action the plo would never have be eject by lebanese arab state or un action please tim do fall into the trap of treat lebanese and palestinian a all part of the same group there be too many who think all arab or all muslim be the same too many time i have see person support the bomb of palestinian camp in retaliation for an idf death at the hand of the lebanese resistance or the shell of lebanese village in retaliation for a palestinian attack i fully recognize that the lebanese do not want to be use by either side and have be and continue to be but the most fundamental issue be that if a state can not control it border and make real effort to do so it should expect other to do it for them hopefully that other will be the un but it be a we see in it cowardice regard bosnium weak tim
