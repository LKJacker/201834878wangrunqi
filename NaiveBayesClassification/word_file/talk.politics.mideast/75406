from flax jona flygare subject re israeli murder in march in article hasan write stuff delete i write are you call name or give me a title if the first read ymy paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again hasan reply i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too unles you consider yourself deserve-les unles you be refer to someone else you have in fact give me a name i do not ask for hence the term call hasan write so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom i reply if you insist on give me i do not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh hasan gloat that wa only to confuse you ha ha ha hey hell-bent on retard into childhood no when you be intentionally neglect the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupy territory be illegitimate and hence all their action their court their law be illegitimate on the grind of occupy territory no i be not neglect that i merely ask you whether the existance of israeli citicen in the wb or in gaza invalidate those individual right be you try to retaliate and confuse me here no i really do try to spell correctly and i apologize if i do confuse you i will try not to repeat that to live a a you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be use in the territory later also you have not adressed my question if the israeli also have human right first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizen in the wb revoke their right of life but it say the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for it citizen basically revoke the right of for it military man clearly occupation be an undeclared war during war attack against military target be fully legitimate ok let me re-phrase the question i have repeatedly ask you if the israeli have le human right than the palestinian and if so why from ymy post where you do not directly adres my question i infer that you think so together with the above statement i then assume that the reason wa the action of the state of israel re ymy statement of occupation i like you to define the term so i do have to repeat thi the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human right but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdraw from the occupy terretory not by further oppress palestinean human right i sorry but the above sentence do not make sense please rephrase it if a state can deprive all it citizen of human right by it action then tell me why any human live today should have any right at all because not all state be like israel a oppressive a ignorant or a tyrant oh ok so how about the human right of the syrian iraqi and other do the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurd in iraq and turkey how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bite farfetched the russian in the baltic state or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavium do the serb have any human right remainaing accord to you and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question be not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the law of minister sharon say kick palestinean out of here all palestine i ask for which system should be use that will preserve human right for all person involve i assume that wa obviou but i wo repeat that mistake now that i have straighten that out i eagerly await ymy reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human right i be understand thi from ymy first statement in thi paragraph no i agree that to just kick all the palestinian out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both party if that what you refer to a the solution then so be it joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization say it best when write in hi diary in between ourself it must be clear that there be no room for both people together in thi country we shall not achieve my goal of be an independent person with the arab in thi small country the only solution be a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arab and there be no other way than to transfer the arab from here to the neighbour country to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be leave only after thi transfer will the country be able to absorb the million of my own brother there be no other way out davar september courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we be to disregard the rather obviou reference to get israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hama charter that the english translation if you have other information i be interest to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i not go to get into the question if he write the above but it fairly obviou all party in the conflict have their share of fanatic gues what those be not the person that will make any last peace in the region more delete stuff exactly you be right i gues that the problem be that the israeli goverment be full with man like joseph weitz oh have you meet with them personally to read their diary fascinating what do you do for a live we and my either refer to zionist or jew i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solve the me problem i think that be fair enough no that be not an answer since i ask for a system that could solve the problem you say any could be use then you provide a contradiction above you write that you understand what i mean underline by any system can be use to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly an unjust solution would be a non-solution per definition no you say the follow for all a it hold that a have property b there exist an a such that property b do not hold thu either or both statement must be false gues where that take ymy logic to never-never land you be prove yourself a a first you understand what i mean but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom i wa merely point out a not so small flaw in ymy reason since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point thi out before you start use ymy statement to prove a point or so am i then to assume you be not logical the greatest problem of zionism be arab child rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quote you put at the end be a real bummer when i try give ymy post any credit why do you feel ashamed by thing and fact that you believe in if you be a zionist if you believe in zionist code and act well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham have say ye zionism be racism if you feel ashamed and bother by the zionist code then drop zionism if you be not zionist why be you bother then you should join me in condemn these racist zionist code and act any quote can be misuse especially when use to stereotype all individual by a statement of an individual if you use the same method that you credit with then where do that place you oh by the way i advice you not to assume anything about my i will and be condemn act i find vile and inhuman but i try a long a i can not to assume those act be by a whole person by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel the leader of israel political religiou or the jew in general if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible instead how would you feel if we start condemn you
