from hallam phill hallam-baker subject re israel expansion in article adam adam shostack write in article write is israel occupation of southern lebanon temporary israel ha repeatedly state that it will leave lebanon when the lebanese government can provide guarantee that israel will not be attack from lebanese soil and when the syrian leave not acceptable syrium and lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the french invasion where they be both part of the same mandate territory read colony israel ha no right to determine what happen in lebanon invading another country because you consider them a threat be precisely the way that almost all war of aggression have start is israel occupation of the west bank gaza and golan temporary the three be very different issue israel ha state repeatedly that it will not give up the whole golan but may be will to give part of it to syrium a part of a peace agreement again territorial expansion by force israel ha already annex area take over in the war these area be not occupy but dispute since there be no legitamate govern body citizenship wa give to those resident in annex area who want citizenship the un define them a occupy they be recognise a such by every nation on earth exclude one small caribean island israel should keep control of part of the west bank imho the part that should be keep be the westernmost mountain ridge which contain few arab town and many suburb a well a overlook the city of tel aviv the eastern mountain ridge should be abandonded thi be where most of the arab live and it be le militarily relevant israel should also maintain a presence in the jordan valley so the adam think that peace be possible with continue occupation and a continue military presence that be a completely unsustainable situation because the usa be bankrupt and simply can not afford to finance the israeli ecconomy any more there be no money for such an occupation if so for those of you who support it why be so many settler move into the territory if it be not temporary let hear it there be a number of reason for person to move they be not move but choose to move into dispute area note that since these move be make by free will human be not settler i will addres two aspect of ymy question why the government would allow or encourage them to move and second why they do move they be move in a part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupy territory machiavelli describe the reason in the prince the clear intention wa to create a constituency which the likud beleived could not be deprive of the land steal from the indigenou population the pretext under which the settler aquired land wa through the redefinition of much land use in common a public land the assertion that the village common on which the village depend for food belong to an invader simply because no individual ha title be clearly an excuse when the land be use to build a condominium for alien bring in to occupy the land for a foreign power there be a clear breach of the geneva convention which stipulate that land use in occupy territory must not be change no amount of self justify on the part of likud and hard linner appologist will change the fact that the majority of world government and all of those that actually have any power have condemn thi practice the government have a number of reason for encourage person to move acros the green line they include security and politic the first reason wa security a large jewish presense make it difficult for terrorist to infiltrate a jewish settlement also act a fortress in time of war theyu also be a liability we be talk about civilian encampment that would last no more than hour against tank a second reason wa political creating settlement bring the arab to the negotiation table had the creation of new town and city go on another several year there would be no place leave in israel where there wa an arab majority there would have be no land leave that could be call arab do fool yourself it wa the gulf war that bring the israeli to the negotiate table once their u backer have a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed shamir to negotiate or else if the creation of settlement have go on any longer the usa would have cut the money supply the fact that there be a hundered thousand jew in place change the face of any peace settlement and restrict what land can be give away not at all they can choose to live in an arab state or return to israel some of the communite create be religiou they build their neighborhood in area where there be jew until the riot of the and there be community like thi in hebron gaza and all over there be also community build near religiou site the existence of a comunity do not give the right for another country to annexe territory not in bosnium not in the west bank the point be there be many reason person move over the green line and many reason the government want them to whatever statu be negotiate for dispute territory it will not be an all or nothing deal new boundary will be draw up by negotiation not be the result of a war unles the new boundary draw up be those of there will be no peace araffat ha preciou little authority to agree to anything else the real issue be not the land treaty but the trade treaty since the palestinian will remain heavily dependent on israel indefinitely it be thi that will be the guarantor of peace another factor will be the return of land confiscate by the israeli state within israel and the dismantle of the shadow structure which allow discrimination against non-jew within what be nominaly a secular state the irony be that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state ha a non descrimination law in order to protect the remain settler the israeli state be go to be force inot the same position thi will mean outlaw of discrimination such a that which prevent arab from buy or use much of the land phill hallam-baker
