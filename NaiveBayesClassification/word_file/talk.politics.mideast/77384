from josip josip loncaric subject re europe v muslim bosnian in article stojanov milan stojanovic write in article josip josip loncaric write the annihilation of islam turk be an older serbian agenda indeed so wa annihilation of german during wwius however it be important to quote adil zuflikarpasic in hi interview to duga had serb want to exterminate muslim they could have do it after the wwi when they be the most love small nation in europe serb do not do that although they supressed some rebellion by albanian muslim and bosnian muslim quite bloodily however thi be quite a misrepresentation after wwi many bosnian muslim be kill and their land take over by serb and the motive wa plunder not some fictitiou supression of rebellion even earlier one can point to the destruction of mosque in serbium itself and expulsion of muslim here be what dr vaso cubrilovic political adviser to the serbian monarchic regime say in hi memorandum the expulsion of the arnaut which he present to the royal government of stojadinovic on march in belgrade the mode of removal describe how expulsion of ethnic albanian from kosova be to proceed through state terror and private initiative chetnik plunder private initiative too can assist greatly in thi direction we should distribute weapon to my colonist a need be the old form of chetnik action should be organize and secretly assist the whole affair should be present a a conflict between clan and if need be ascribe to economic reason finally local riot can be incite these will be bloodily suppress with the clan and the chetnik rather than the army there remain one more mean which serbium employed with great practical effect after that be by secretly burn down albanian village and city quarter emphasi above be mine these event in serbium itself force out virtually all muslim during late century thi policy of state terrorism against muslim aid by chetnik private initiative ha continue in wwius and today for example muhamed hadzijahic in hi book od tradicije do identitetum geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih muslimana sarajevo svjetlost write pg how serb kill a muslim in foca in wwius even though he claim to be a serbian patriot explain their action a follow inasmuch a you be a serb you sully the serb name because you be a turk muslim and since you help u we shall not torture you so the shoot him instead of cut hi throat in the past year serb have repeat the slaughter of muslim resident of foca destruction of mosque include priceles historical monument complete the eradication of the muslim presence from territory claim by serb i strongly dispute ymy notion that croat have a similar older agenda in fact for the past century or two croat and muslim have see themself a have a lot in common and they generally have friendly relation ymy suggestion that croat-muslim relationship be anything like serb-muslim relationship be completely wrong to say that croat and muslim have a lot in common do not imply they be not separate people how touch i have nearly cry while i read thi unfortunately mostly untrue which part do you claim be untrue explain yourself or withdraw ymy claim croat from croatium mostly have no contact with muslim since they be mostly deal with extreme preudice long time ago however one of the main agenda be turn bosnium into purely catholic state croatium never have many muslim citizen for historical reason because it wa not a part of the ottoman empire the last major battle between austro-hungarian monarchy and the ottoman empire in croatium be at the end of the century need i remind you that modern croatian nationalism come into be with dr ante starcevic who saw bosnian muslim a the best croat so much so that in he contemplate move hi operation to sarajevo you be confuse clericalist croatianism with croatian nationalism here political nationalism ha alway be stronger a for ymy other theory you be clearly overjoy that croat-muslim alliance in bosnia-herzegovina be now in trouble argument such a your be clearly intend to create and deepen thi split i should add few more thing evan in hi on foot through b h describe that catholic clergy in the last century wa apparently more scar by serb then by turk because serb be grow stronger and unlike turk represent great danger for idea of catholic bosnium president tudjman clearly state in hi book that muslim do not exist a a separate nation from croat and serb and he many time suggest even in interviewe to foreign paper that solution be to split bosnium josip know thi and he be only work on the image of croatium in international relation you learn that unles weak unite to counterbalance the strong player soon they be take over and that the end of them balance of power think ha bring together croat and bosnian muslim thi be only natural all other alignment be unstable i work on point out thi basic fact croat and muslim have be aware of it for a long a serbium ha exist you be wrong if you think only image be at stake here croatium ha a deep interest in her alliance with bosnian muslim and vice versa i think tudjman understand thi although he do not have much choice at thi point tension should have be defuse better earlier before any open confrontation develop although i still think croatium will survive it will lose a lot but bosnian muslim may end up even worse off however their position now be so horrible that perhap they do not see it get any worse the key point be do they still have any hope leave if not then all bet be off mr stojanovic be clearly very very happy about thi i deeply hurt thi be not about some image but about survival of a concept of a partnership which i believe be natural and essential for both croat and muslim sigh josip
