from jaskew joseph askew subject re israel an apartheid state not quite in article shaig shai guday write in article jaskew joseph askew write please cite specific example where an arab party member wa reject while a jewish party member wa accept if you look at the bottom of thi article you will see that i have very kindly dig up one of yigal aren previou post entirely without hi permission i hope he do mind contain translation from detail just such a case perhap you think that ly would you like to provide me with an assurance that thi practise never occur if you examine these i be sure you will discover that the arab party member do not have the power base that hi jewish counterpart have right arab have be vote in israel for how long and in all that time not one arab ever gain enough of a personal follow to get hi fellow party member to put in a ministry thi be about a likely a sprout wing and fly to rio what basi do you have for explain thi odd failure you seem very confident that you be right exactly how do you know why be you sure once again if for argument sake all the arab israeli be to vote for labor at the next election you can rest assure that the number of arab mk and cabinet member would increase proportionately to the power shift exactly what basi do you have for say thi when the labmy party ha never put an arab into a cabinet post and insist it coalition member do the same why and on what basi be you reassure me in the face of year of discriminatory practise you be overlook the fact that they wield political power a individual base upon a wider collective power base hey what a i say even when their party put them up they get knock back it surely could be because they be arab be it the reason i see at work be purely political a far a security go i think that some seriou gaff be make by right wing jew a well sharon well ye but security be the reason most often give by person who want to make excuse i merely think it would crop up and so pre-empted it start of article all commet in be mine not dr aren comment in square bracket be mine yigal from the other front july translation of article racism in the knesset coalition requirement on one hand and the presence of progressive mk from meretz in the coalition on the other have compel rabin and hi friend to change to some extent their attitude toward the arab public and their representative in the knesset although he do refuse to view them a partner take part in the coalition and join the government he do agree to meet with them and to give them a document of intention which include a commitment to work toward a decrease in the discrimination between jewish and arab citizen decrease what but poster have tell u time and again that such discrimination do not exist at all is rabin too a closet self-hater yigal however racism ha not disappear when the knesset sit to consider who would staff it variou committee a request wa make to put an mk from hadash the communist party one of the arab party yigal on the state comptroller committee and oh do that ever stir up a storm include in the rank of labor since many knesset member find it unthinkable that an arab mk sit on one of the important house committee security secret be liable to fall into their hand thi attitude which until recently have not even arouse criticism be so natural and so deeply-embossed upon person heart hold that there be knesset member who despite have be elect by ten of thousand of vote be not entitle to be full partner in the body which represent the person of israel we be not speak here of political discrimination which would be bad enough in itself but of racial discrimination the proof one of the compromise propose wa that mk mahamid an arab yigal should be replace by tamar gojanski a jew yigal from the same party it wa not the member party which wa consider unfit but hi race here be a document case in a respect israeli newspaper it be worth note that for the first time since the state found a public debate ha arise on thi subject a witnes the follow article a test of self-confidence by levus july revelation of discrimination against arab have become such an integral part of my daily routine that there be not much effort make to deal with them do you hear that please contact thi levus fellow and explain to him how little he know about israel please yigal except that sometime the demon burst out from behind the government window dress and then the phenomenon be seven time more seriou last week provide two more such example the israeli knesset be find it very difficult to allow arab representation on it more important committee and israel television be find it no le difficult to give a platform to arab from the territory seemingly two entirely different matter but in fact they be one and the same the knesset prove last week that even though one third of it member be new face it ha not renew it own face at all at least on one issue parliamentary tradition may be modernize and parliamentary tradition may become obsolete and only one tradition endure forever no arab shall set foot in the more important committee of the house there ha never be and never will be an arab mk on the external affair and defense committee or on the finance committee world have be overturn over the question of whether or not to give arab for the first time a place on the state comptroller committee the argument be old and well-known in all three of the above committee innumerable secret be reveal and woe unto u if an arab should hear them one must not make light of such argument but their significance should also not be exaggerate every arab mk be not spend all hi time wait for the opportune moment to hand over information from the knesset committee room to black panther headquarter in jenin and not all the aforementioned committee be continually occupy in the discussion of top-secret matter which could safely be reveal for example to mk supportive of the jewish underground but not to an arab mk from the likud labor or even from hadash the arab themself would probably forego membership in the subcommittee on secret service matter but what would happen one may ask if mk nawaf masalha be to hear god forbid a review of the foreign minister in an open meet of the foreign affair and defense committee or even a review of the army chief of staff which in any case be regularly leak to the next edition of the news and what would happen if mk hashem mahamid be to report on what he have see with hi own eye at al-najah their non-participation in important committee and that of their colleague create an intolerable situation where arab member of the elect house have only semi-position they be good enough for address plenary session and for vote for or against the government and participate in the deliberation of the immigration and absorption committee but they must not for example participate in the proces of formulate the state budget in the finance committee or in the allocation of resource to local authority in any case they have little part in that labor dependence on the support of the arab party ha bring about some improvement mk hashem mahamid will it seem participate in the state comptroller committee earlier there have be a ridiculou attempt make to dictate to hadash who their representative should be and thu to prevent the arab from enter thi dubiou holy-of-holies but it soon become clear that there wa no legal or constitutional back for such a step but not to worry even now the jewish mind be contrive device the new committee chair roni milo ha already announce that he will set up subcommittee aplenty for hi committee thu he will decide where it be permissible for mahamid to participate and where not a solution such a thi could by the way also have be adopt for the rest of the committee thereby completely eliminate the fear of state secret be leak to the enemy and remove
