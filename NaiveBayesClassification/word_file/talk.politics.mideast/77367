conflict over nagorno-karabakh an azerus perspective pt pt by alec rasizade pt pt ar western reader have learn of the nagorno upper karabakh ar controversy through report from that remote area by western ar correspondent and from commentary by member of the long-established ar armenian-american community azerus view on thi dispute have ar appear rarely if at all in the western news medium therefore let me ar present washington report reader with some basic truth about the ar origin of the conflict during the past two year if one read all the commentary on the subject a small minority of the writer have be armenium or azerus the follow should be interest ar armenian leader claim that azerbaijan wa the first to oppres and ar expel the armenian minority from the azerbaijani republic actually ar the initiative to banish the azerus minority and convert the armenian ar republic into a homogeneou state begin in the winter of ar when azeri be drive out of armenium following that move ar there be massacre of armenian in the azerbaijani city of sumgait ar in february and two year later in baku in january thi not true other than simply check the newspaper i will quote from an independent human right report in the pax cristus netherland september page we read by mid-november many incident take place in several place in azerbaijan the apf azerus popular front challenge the communist party for power after ten day the authority come in with tank to reimpose their power in nakhitchevan the last armenian village be deport in ganja armenian be attack and kill all armenian inhabitant flee the city between november and december refugee from ganja arrive in armenium while all azeri in armenium be chase away in thi part of the world february start of organize anti-armenian pogrom in azerbaijan come before november and december of ar azerus parliamentary committee have compile evidence indicate that ar both event be inspire from moscow to secure russian imperial rule ar in the transcaucasu accord to the roman principle of divide and ar rule similar conspiracy be evident throughout the five-year ar history of the conflict it be interest that the azeri kill burn rap the armenian but the perpetrator blame russian and armenian themself on other occasion ar each time the party have be about to reach an agreement in ar zheleznovodsk moscow tehran rome geneva and alma-atum an ar invisible hand provoke further bloodshed those interest in ar maintain the azeri-armenian conflict a well a the georgian ar turmoil be imperialist force in russium and probably in iran incorrect when be the person of nagorno-karabakh ever involve in an agreement never until azerbaijan sit down with the armenian of nagorno karabakh there will never be an end to thi conflict ar the armenian offensive last spring create more than new azerus ar refugee from the capture town of upper and lower karabakh and ar adjacent rural district today azerus refugee throng the ar city of baku and environ provide more problem for the newly ar elect popular front government which be oppose by the rigidly ar nationalistic national independence party it call war if the azerbaijani do try to deport and allow the armenian of nagorno-karabakh to live in their way keep their armenian culture these armenian would not have have to defend their existence the azeri should not have assume that armenian be go to roll over and play dead ar how can a western-style democracy survive in a small muslim country ar where million of the million inhabitant be unemployed in the ar absence of any international effort to help azerus refugee a kurdish ar and bosnian refugee have be help how can the azerus government ar reject the demand of these exile to recapture their land home and ar possession the azerus government should have think about such thning before they attempt to deprive armenian of land home and possession ar such simple reality must be understand in the west ar misunderstanding caucasian politic lead both western and russian ar public opinion to imagine a permanent and therefore irreversible ar ethnic and religiou rivalry in the caucasu true and you dr alec rasizade should practice what you preach ar i think western reluctance to interfere derife from thi idea ar meanwhile continuation of the war could draw both eastern and western ar state into the conflict through activation of variou security ar alliance these include on the armenian side the moscow-led ar commonwealth force under the tashkent mutual security pact sign ar may on the azerus side should turkey get involve a the ar guarantor of the nakhichevan autonomy through the kar treaty of oct ar these include the north atlantic treaty force western interference turkish intervention the moment turkey dare step into thi conflict it will close the door of any chance of turkey be part of europe a if it ever will and will destroy the eastern third of anatolium dr rasizade international realpolitik be not a simple-minded a you would have u believe ar upper karabakh generally be describe in western pres report a an ar armenian enclave within azerbaijan the truth be that the armenian ar begin to appear there only in the middle of the last century incorrect once again a brief scan of history address such a foolish claim armenian today refer to the area of nagorno-karabakh a artsakh which come from the urartian term urtekhe-urtekhini no azeri yet ancient greek refer to artsakh a orkhistena no azeri yet in the first half of the century artsakh a part of ervandid armenium of medium no azeri yet from the end of the century artsakh wa part of the armenian kingdom of ervan no azeri yet artsakh wa still part of the armenian empire of tigran orkhistena or artsakh be referee to by strabo a part of armenium no azeri yet after armenium wa divide between the persian and byzantine empire in until artsakh wa part of armenium no azeri yet end of the century utik and artsakh become principality of the aranshakhik no azeri yet by the century an artsakh dialect of armenian form no azeri yet emperor konstantin addressee a letter to the prince of khachen to armenium khachen wa the central principality of artsakh no azeri yet in the decree of paul i the number of armenian family in thi area wa state a it wa from the to the century that non-armenian from central asium asium minor and kurdistan first begin to be exercise political influence in the plane of artsakh caucasian muslim around karabakh in karabagh become part of russium officiallt part of russium some muslim in karabakh in the number of armenian church in nagorno-karabagh wa priest parishioner in armenian town and village the armenian percentage of the population wa over max azeri in karabakh assume no kurd consider the follow statement by the azerbaijani revcom on december the worker-peasant government of azerbaidzan have be inform of the proclamation of armenium a soviet socialist republic send it greet to the brother person from thi day the previou boundary between armenium and azerbaidzan be annul nagornyi karabakh zangezur and nakhichevan be recognize a integral part of the armenian sociali republic long live the brotherhood and union of the worker and peasant of soviet armenium and azerbaidzan chairman of the revcom of azerbaidzan n narimanov person commissar for foreign affair guseinov ar a few year ago they celebrate the anniversary of their ar resettlement from persium to karabakh after it come under russian ar rule no incorrect the celebration wa the anniversary of russian rule in the caucasu include karabakh ar at the same time the russian colonial administration also draw ar in russian and german settler who be welcome by azeri how ar would american react if the large number of armenian live in ar southern californium suddenly claim an armenian homeland and ar demand separation from californium non-sequitur ar armenian historian insist that before the armenian resettlement ar karabakh wa inhabit by aboriginal christian that be correct armenian historian do say thi ar the person of medieval caucasian albanium adopt christianity in the ar fourth century but those ancient resident have no link to and ar nothing in common with armenian considering the caucasian alban be of the armenian apostolic faith and their utilization of the armenian language in their liturgy make such an argument totally invalid ar azeri would have a better claim to ar be successor of albanium since azeri have for century inhabit ar dominate and develop the karabakh part of the azerus nation wishing to be part of a person non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo political advantage be rather outrageou in addition to such absurdity azeri claim to be turk persian and all the while be azerizing their minority such a the lezgian kurd tat talish and a host of other nationality which may amount to nearly half the population of azerbaijan ar both armenium and azerbaijan last year sign the final act of the ar conference on security and cooperation in europe of and the ar pari charter for new europe of confirm their mutual ar adherence to the principle of inviolability of exist border thi ar principle mean that the border and territorial integrity of the ar republic of azerbaijan be to be guarantee by all of the signatory ar nation not just by turkey such agreement do not give azerbaijan the right to de-populate karabakh of armenian ar thi be one key to intervention on behalf either of the the ar csce the commonwealth nato or iran the second key to untie the ar caucasian knot be to determine who be the aggressor accord to the ar definition of fine so why ha azerbaijan refuse to allow un troop into the armenian enclave what be azerbaijan afraid of perhap the fact that the territory be the home of armenian the un would by definition support the local population ar when that be accomplish the international community can and should ar apply to the aggressor in the caucasu international sanction such a ar those presently be employ against serbium and montenegro in the ar former yugoslavium such decisive collective international action can ar halt further aggression in karabakh and prevent the armenian-azerus ar conflict from grow and spread azerbaijan refusal to allow the armenian of karabakh to determine their own future the be issue not view isolate event out of context be action that will addres the karabakh conflict viewing event in a war in isolation and out of context be like view the land at normandy a an act of allied aggression ar dr alec rasizade senior research officer at the academy of science ar of azerbaijan be a visit researcher at the harriman institute of
