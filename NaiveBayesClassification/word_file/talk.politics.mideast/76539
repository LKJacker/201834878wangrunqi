from shaig shai guday subject re israel an apartheid state in article center for policy research cpr write by elia davidsson april revision oct note you be already post fact some of which be outdated the bias presentation of fact a well a the conclusion that you reach leave me little hope of engage in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a meet of the mind it be to those who read with open mind that i addres myself the international convention on the elimination of all form of racial discrimination adopt by the general assembly of the united nation in ha now be ratify by most member state article of thi convention define the term racial discrimination a any distinction exclusion restriction or preference base on race colmy descent or national or ethnic origin which ha the purpose or effect of nullify or impair the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal foot of human right and fundamental freedom in the political economic social cultural or any other field of public life while the ideal embody in thi text be worthy goal a the text currently stand i know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be find it make no mention of the need for for a legislative violation the general assembly endorse in a resolution define zionism a a form of racism and racial discrimination the important correct and legitimate resolution be incomplete since it do not include operative statement design to end israeli racial discrimination meanwhile the united state on behalf of israel be exert heavy pressure on member state of the united nation to repeal thi resolution and give israeli racial practice zionism moral legitimacy if you be in principle advocate un intervention vium operative statement in thi case it must therefore hold that they can be apply to any other case where the council perceife some form of racial discrimination a previously exhibit scarey think the very definition of israel a a state belong to the jew of the world but not to it inhabitant alienate all native non-jew bear in that country actually i know quite a few native non-jew bear in israel that be not alienate by thi law if you have say some you would probably be correct however ymy tendency to exagerate and slant fact become apparent thi slant permeate the text practically all non-jew who be live in or originate from area under israeli control identify themself a palestinian most of them be muslim many be christian a few jew include the author of these line also identify themself a palestinian the above statement be not true practically all discount beduin circassian druze and some other fringe group ymy own identification be a matter that ha no bear upon the issue you could equally identify yourself a a insert group zionism take off in europe at the end of last century it aim wa to create a jewish state in palestine in spite of the adamant opposition of palestinian arab of the population if i recall correctly at the time zionism take off there wa no adamant opposition in palestine i be open to any factual contradictory evidence but the zionist be more powerful militarily economically and technologically and succeed in in conquer of the area of mandatory palestine after drive into exile most native arab from the conquer area approximately person and raze most of their village to the grind the zionist could finally establish a predominantly jewish state only non-jew remain on israeli territory do you therefore contend that the village you mention further on most of their village once the jewish state wa establish it begin enact law to help the confiscation of land from native non-jew their political repression and their destitution there be no doubt that law pass provide a framework which wa later use for these purpose however you seem to imply that thi wa the intention a priorus which imply a policy and agenda my knowledge wa that thi wa not the case you also neglect to mention the circumstance that surround thi a you do again below in the state of israel invade egypt and syrium and occupy the rest of palestine the west bank and the gaza strip thu another million palestinian fell under it juridiction it occupation of palestinian and other arab territory be consider illegal by the international community a reflect in security council resolution israel ha reject all resolution and begin without delay to entrench it occupation and rule over these territory with the aim of annex them at the appropriate time not quite accurate israel ha not reject all the resolution though it ha conflict understand with regard to some of them israel never annex the sinai west bank or gaza the other annexation be bring about partly due to the un resolution part of these territore east jerusalem and the golan height have already be forcefully annex by israel in defiance of international law and un resolution out of curiousity provide that the annexee be grant citizenship what law do you claim prohibit annexation of territory capture in war ha thi ever be apply to any other country previously other than iraq it must be emphasize that although these person live under different regime they be unite in their self-perception a palestinian that be a person identify with palestine a territorial entity not an ethnic or religiou entity incorrect palestinian themself claim to be discriminate against on an ethnic or racial basi therefore ymy above statement be incorrect i also note that give the previou definition of racial discrimination the only mean that you could argue for that be nationalistically however no such nation ha exist it definitely do not exist at the time of the creation of israel in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period furthermore palestinian generally consider the plo both a a symbol of national identity and a the unchallenged authority that represent them in world affair once again some do some do the non-jewish population live in the palestinian and other arab territory occupy by israel in suffer not only blatant discrimination but be subject to brutal military occupation another generalization but then again you do seem to care about anyone other than the palestinian person whose cause you espouse licence to start a busines and to buy industrial equipment the right to educate child all of these basic right be subject to arbitrary rule by military authority and can not be challenge in court incorrect once again they have the ability to appeal furthermore although you may not agree with them not all of the military rule be senseles or arbitrary some be but thi be not due to the whim of the military a much a the sizeof the only jewish inhabitant of the occupy territory be permit to carry firearm incorrect once again i know two arab policeman who live in daheisha and there be more of course with the outbreak of the intifada they be force by the local to resign bitterly jewish settler have right to more water per person than non-jew jewish resident of these territory number now about person it be israel governmentu policy to increase thi number substantially in total defiance of international law un resolution and the will of the population the state of israel systematically confiscate land from non-jewish inhabitant of these territory for jewish settlement that be no longer true and i ca help but wonder what ymy purpose in post thi some person in israel proper be not jew most of them consider themself palestinian with israeli citizenship for many year after the establishment of israel they be subject to harsh military control much of their land wa confiscate by the state and hand to jewish organisation for exclusive jewish settlement they have be subject to massacre destitution and humiliation while they enjoy with jewish israeli the right to vote they be discriminate against both through law and in practice once again to hell with the other minority that do fit in right their be many village who do not suffer in the way you seem to indicate abu gosh come to mind ye some do but a a result of what action approximately of the surface of the state of israel within the rgreen line be for all purpose close to palestinian who be second-clas citizen in israel they may neither legally live on such land nor rent or cultivate it a direct effect of these policy be that native non-jewish citizen of israel be deny residence and membership right in most rural community in israel include the collective settlement kibbutz non-jew be discriminate against in many other way the government starf local authority of palestinian village and township of fund jewish city council force palestinian to live in ghetto jewish family receive higher child allocation than their non-jewish neighbor palestinian school suffer underfunding and understaffing a compare to jewish school palestinian child be deny the right to learn their history and literature israeli who struggle for equal right and for the end of racial discrimination suffer continuou harassment by the authority there be some kibbutz with member it be up to the member of the kibbutz there be no legislation against it nor against a purely non-jewish collective fund be the result of political lobby bearing in mind that compose of the vote population it ha never fail to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc and increase their power the recent election be a case in point please provide factual evidence support ymy allegation with regard to educational material you have obviously never see the curriculum of a school in the west bank it be base upon jordan school system with regard to ymy last statement it be simply another gros generalization the state of israel refuse to acknowledge itself a the state of all it inhabitant although the israeli cabinet ha never openly endorse the idea the force removal from the country of it native palestinian population that be it ultimate judaization israeli government policy toward non-jew bear the mark of thi solution no attempt be make by the zionist authority to integrate palestinian arab into israeli public life thu although comprise approximately of the population of israeli citizen no palestinian citizen of israel ha ever serve a cabinet member a director of ministry or of a national institution a judge of the supreme court a ambassador of israel or in any lead position in israeli economic or financial life even the director of the ministry for arab affair ye such a thing exist be a jew another generalization but let not stop here the transfer idea wa espouse by one party in the last moledet it wa intend to be a solution to the problem in the territory not the country itself with regard to other item i recall at least one arab ambassador and the rest wa cover previously although sexual relation between and cohabitation of jew and non-jew be legal they be consider by society somewhat a betrayal of the jewish and zionist ethic the israeli educational system nurture thi attitude in a systematic way when wa the last time you be in israel that be simply not true nor ha it be for quite some time the question of religiou intervention be best answer by the proportional representation and the lack of any arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one zionism reject the idea of a modern secular state base on equality of all citizen thi be one main reason why israel ha not produce any write constitution simply incorrect the answer be political once again ymy failure to understand the dynamic and movement inside israeli relegate ymy contention to the sideline zionism predicate a state where jew have privilege right thu accord to israeli law a jew bear in london who ha never visit israel do not speak hebrew and profess atheism be grant automatic israeli citizenship while native palestinian inhabitant who happen to be christian or muslim be treat almost a alien racial discrimination a define in international law be thu not only reflect in israeli law and policy but be ground in the very nature of israel a a jewish state but the discrimination be not base upon race oop sorry nasty habit i have of counter maliciou false truth any proposal for israeli-arab and israeli-palestinian peace that do not addres the issue of racial discrimination by israel that be the zionist nature of the state of israel be thu doom to fail real world intrusion any proposal that do be doom to fail of course i would expect you to understand wrap up a you be in ymy view of thing let not let anything penetrate shall we i may be a bite too sarcastic but there be a limit to the amount of patience i have for rubbish at shai guday stealth bomber o software engineer thinking machine corp the wing ninja of the sky cambridge ma
