kuwaitus fleet al-qatif obviously would not have surrender in a mere three hour in relation to thi a question arise a to why the ottoman warship refrain from participate in the bombardment the answer ly in report relate to the political movement that precede account of the progress of the expedition because the ottoman be unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace impose by britain in the area the sultan and the pasha promise their warship would not be use in the war against or any sheikh in the war zone kuwait which wa not a party to the above-mentioned treaty of wa under no such obligation especially since the expedition wa not direct against those who have sign it from the above text we can see that kuwait wa not part of the ottoman or the british colony for more detail about the mention expedition please check out the source of the above text the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu-hakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait thi be another article of a series of article that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout it history from both iraq and the ottoman the follow text discus a dispute on an estate call sufiyya in zubair iraq between the sheikh of kuwait and al-zuhair tribe in zubair in trouble develop over the possession by sheikh sabah of the estate which wa purchase by hi father sheikh jabir in thi property wa sequester by a turkish representative on the basi of a claim by the al-zuhair that the vendor have be the owner of a share and not of the n sufiyya at the same time sheikh sabah wa require to expel from other land own by him at the island of fao some cultivator who have immigrate from persian territory it should be recall that the turkish official from the start show strong prejudice in favor of the zuhair claimant abdulla ibn sabah the eldest son of the ruler of kuwait who go to basra a hi father agent in the case narrowly escape be throw into jail upon hi refusal to make a payment amount to the value of seven year produce which the ottoman authority deem the plaintiff be entitle to receive eventually the dispute wa settle by the wali governor of baghdad in favor of the sheikh of kuwait the decision of the governor of basra in favor of the sheikh wa apparently make for variou reason some writer think that the governor want to win abdulla over to the turkish side and suggest that the governor namiq pasha even offer him the title of which he decline nevertheles the proceed of the turk in thi case be regard by the inhabitant of kuwait a attempt to cause a confrontation with zubair it seem that they have anticipate a conflict and accord to report by the british agent at basra the person of kuwait be prepare to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to turkish rule lorimer suggest that the final order of namiq pasha uphold the kuwait sheikh title to sufiyya wa perhap due to a report that sheikh sabah with the object of attack zubair if the decision should go against him have obtain a promise of countenance and arm support from the wahhabi amir in addition to thi legal matter with zubair kuwait have have other problem with basra whose court try to jail abdulla ibn sabah a explain above however kuwait relation with the ottoman mutasallim of basra have at time be amicable and in several instance those mutasallim even seek refuge at kuwait when pressure by the pasha of baghdad

mcgill university canada independent kuwait thi be another article that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout it history from both iraq and the ottoman the british have alway regard sheikh jabir a a good friend but in october an event take place at kuwait which could have weaken those good relation on october lieutenant edmund the assistant resident at abu shahr in iran arrive in kuwait on a special mission from the resident captain hennell hi mission wa to find out if kuwait wa will to welcome the establishment of a british line of post acros the desert from kuwait to the mediterranean the british war vessel fire the usual salute in honor of the sheikh after it have anchor in the water of kuwait bay the salute wa not acknowledge and edmund wait in the vessel for three day before he wa able to communicate with the sheikh after edmund return to abu shahr both he and captain hennell explain thi unusual behavior of the sheikh to have be due not to ill-will but principally to a desire to mislead the egyptian agent at kuwait a to the nature of hi relation with the british therefore they consider that jabir conduct do not indicate any change in hi friendly policy toward the british if the british tolerate the attitude of jabir toward edmund so also do the egyptian earlier in the same year some of the most want man in the wahhabi camp such a ibn the wahhabi general in al-hasa and wahhabi tribe like al-duwaish seek refuge in kuwait protection of refugee seek political asylum in hi country wa a policy that have be adopt earlier by sheikh abdulla ibn sabah thi can therefore be look upon a an indication of self-confidence an outcome of kuwait independence from foreign power it corroborate the fact that kuwait if necessary wa prepare to defend itself against more powerful neighbor thi defense depend not only on the wall of the city but also on bedouin tribe in it neighborhood and a merchant fleet equip with the necessary gun comparable to other arab fleet of the time a to kuwait position between and one can safely state that it manage to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggle wahhabi and egyptian relation with the british and even with the pasha of baghdad continue on good term source the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu-hakima mcgill university canada they be try to recover land they believe wa their much
