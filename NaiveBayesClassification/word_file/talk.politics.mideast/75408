soviet presidium against karabagh become part of armenium after the event in sumgait and those in baku the best solution be to give karabagh to armenium return it to armenium since the person want to live peacefully with the azerbaijani but everything ha to be right before they can do that i arrive in karabagh on april i felt very bad i have constant headach after a while my strength return my
