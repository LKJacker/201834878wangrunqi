armenian of the community could have prevent thi massacre however the armenian intellectual have share the same idea with the renegade in thi massacre just a in all the other the lower class within the armenian community have alway obey the order of the lead armenian figure and commander i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectual be accessory to these murder no for there be person who oppose the armenian for such action since they understand that it would yield no result however such person be only a minority furthermore such person be consider a traitor to the armenian cause some have seemingly oppose the armenian murder but have support the massacre secretly some on the other hand prefer to remain silent there be certain other who when accuse by the russian of infamy would say the follow be russian you can never understand the armenian cause the armenian have a conscience they would commit massacre and then would flee in fear of the turkish soldier the incident that occur only recently clearly manifest the real nature of the armenian ideology nothing which be already do can be undo serdar argic close the road and mountain pas that might serve a way of escape for the turk and then proceed in the work of extermination ohanu appressian soviet armenium today there no longer exist a single turkish soul sahak melkonian
