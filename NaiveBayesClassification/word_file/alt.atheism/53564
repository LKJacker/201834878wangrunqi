from simon simon clippingdale subject re american and evolution now with free ockham razor inside sorry about the delay in respond due to conference paper deadline panic in article bob robert singleton write in article simon simon clippingdale write alarming amount of agreement delete i make my statement about ockum razor from my experience in physic thank for info in baysian statistic very interest and i do know it before i follow ymy proof but i have one question we have two hypothesis h and hg the latter be more complicate which by definition mean p h p hg that complicate be in fact where p h p hg come from it more the other way around it from p h p hg p hg where g be the complement of g and by axiom p anything so p hg so p h p hg in a sense hg be necessarily more complicate than h for any h and g so i may be split hair but what i try to say be that irrespective of subjective impression of how complicate something be p h p hg hold with equality if and only if p hg a you point out it a very simple matter to show p x h p x hg p h x p hg x and thu h be to be preferd to hg now to say that h be a consistent with the datum a hg be to say p x h p x hg can you elaborate some on thi well p x a p x b mean that x be a likely to be observe if a be operative a it be if b be operative thi imply that observe x do not provide any useful information which might allow u to discriminate between the respective possibility that a and b be operative the difference reduce to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior probability p a and p b p x a p x b p a x k p a and p b x k p b where k p x a p x p x b p x so a and b be equally consistent with the datum in that observe x do give any pointer a to which of a or b be operative in the particular case where a h and b hg however we know that their prior probability be order by p h p hg although we do know the actual value and it thi which allow u to deploy the razor to throw out any such hg also in the real world it be a clear cut and dry it seem to me we ca alway determine whether the equality p x h p x hg be true that certainly true but the particular point here wa whether or not a divine component actually underly the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religiou implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spread the word now it seem to me a i say that the observe variance in religiou belief be well account for by the memetic transmission model but rather le well if one propose a divine component in addition since i would expect the latter to conspire against wide variance and even mutual exclusion among belief thu my personal feel be that p x hg be even equal to p x h in thi case but be smaller h be memetic transmission g be divine component x be the variance among belief but i happily acknowledge that thi be a subjective impression btw my beef with ymy baysian argument wa not a mathematical one i check most of ymy work and do find an error and you seem very careful so there probably be a math mistake i think the mistake be philosophical but just to make sure i understand you can please rephrase it in non-technical term i think thi be a reasonable request i alway try to look for way of explain physic to non-physicist i not a baysian statistician nor any type of statistician so thi would be very helpful not that i a statistician a such either but the idea be that both theism and atheism be compatible with all of the read my observation to date however theism of the type with which i be concern also suggest that for instance prayer may be answer person may be miraculously heal both be in principle amenable to statistical verification and that may generally intervene in measurable way thi mean that these region of the space of possible observation which i loosely term appearance of have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesi and zero under the atheistic since there be only so much probability available for each hypothesi to scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism expend on make appearance of possible must come from somewhere else other possible observation all else be equal thi mean that an observation which an appearance of must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism the bayesian stuff imply that such observation must cause my run estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesi to increase with a correspond decrease in my run estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesi sorry if that still a bite jargonesque but it rather difficult to put it any other way since it do depend intimately on the property of conditional probability density and particularly that the total area under them be alway unity an analogy may or may not be helpful say that hypothesi a be the coin be fair and that b be the coin be unfair two-headed i use a and b to avoid confusion with h head and t tail then p h a total p t a p h b total p t b the observation be a string of head with no tail thi be compatible with both a fair coin a and a two-headed coin b however the probability expend by a on make possible the appearance of tail even though they do actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must be unity and it come in thi case from the probability of the appearance of head say my run estimate at time be e a and e b the observation x n at time n be another head x n h the estimate be modify accord to p h a e n a e a e a m p h and p h b e n b e b e b p h now we do know p h the actual prior probability of a head but the multiplier for e a be half that for e b thi be true every time the coin be toss and a head be observe thu whatever the initial value of the estimate after n head we have n e n a m e a and n e n b e b and since e k a e k b at any time k you can show that m and thu hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesi a must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesi b must increase even though both hypothesis be compatible with a string of head the loose analogy be between unfair coin and atheism and between fair coin and theism with observation consistent with both a tail which would falsify unfair coin be analogou to an appearance of which would falsify atheism i be not claim that the analogy extend to the numerical value of the variou probability just that the principle be the same constant observation of no evidence for god if evidence for them be at all possible under the respective theism constantly increase the notional estimate probability that they do exist it important to draw a distinction between theism that could be support or not support by evidence and theism that ca given a theism for which evidence be in principle not possible it do make sense to say lack of evidence support the contrary view quite so but thi type of theism be what i might call the g in the hg in term of my ockham razor discussion and i bin it on those grind so it depend upon ymy conception of thi god if it a conception like zeu who happen to come down to earth to play quite frequently then i agree with you lack of evidence for thi conception of god be evidence that it do not exist but if ymy conception of god be one that do not make falsifiable prediction see below on falsifiable prediction then i disagree lack of evidence do not support a disbelief the hypothesis do have to be falsifiable and indeed in my model the theism be falsifiable i use the phrase should obverse given any specific theism do not make the prediction p x ht that why i use the word should theism make no prediction about any specific event i can only say i believe that god do such and such after such and such happen or i believe god will do such and such but for any give i can never a priorus say p x ht i can not even say thi for the set of all or some thi be what do like about ymy use of probability we also have no way of assign these probability i hold science to positivistic criterium if someone can not tell me how to measure even in principle p x h then probability be not applicable to hypothesi h such be the case when h ht theistic and ha atheistic for example p x ha p x ha p ha what be p ha how do i measure it you do have to we do need in the above analogy to know any prior probability to deduce that the update multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesi be le than unity and that the correspond multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesi be greater than unity you do need to know the initial value of the run estimate either it clear that after a large number of observation p fair-coin approach zero and p two-headed-coin approach unity all you need to know be whether p x ha be larger than p x ht for observe x and thi follow from the assumption that there be certain event render possible not necessary under ht which be not possible under ha and all else be equal baysian statistic rely upon a series of observation but what if the hypothesi be amenable to observation and even for statement that be amenable to observation some observation be not relevant a sequence of observation must be choose with care i curiou to know what type of observation x x you have in mind concern theism and atheism any observation you like it really do matter nor affect the reason provide that there be some possible observation which would count a appearance of example of thi might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of revelation but any statement about p x h for general x still count a a prediction of h if the theism in question ht say that prayer may be answer or that miracle may happen see my interpretation quote again above of what god exist mean then thi be a prediction p x ht for such x it what distinguish it from the atheist hypothesi ha which predict that thi stuff do not happen p x ha for such x theism do not make the claim that p x ht for such x or i should say that my theism do maybe i wa too quick to say we have a common language you say that by the existence of god you mean the notion that the deity describe by the bible and by christian do interact with the universe a claim by those agent i agree with thi however i must be careful here i believe thi i not make any claim maybe i should have change do to can there be an important shift of emphasi but any way since i only have a belief i can not conclude p x ht for such x ok we downgrade do interact to may interact which would actually be better since do interact imply a falsifiability which we both agree be misplace i do think my theism make prediction maybe i not understand what you mean by prediction could you explain what you mean by thi word i explain but bear in mind that thi be central all i require of a theism be that it not make the prediction appearance of will never happen a do atheism before somebody point out that quantum mechanic do make thi prediction either the difference be that qm and atheism do not form a partition prediction include such statement a prayer be efficaciou imply if you do the stat you will find that prayer be efficaciou or prayer be not efficaciou or verily i say unto you thi generation shall not pa till all these thing be fulfil i do think we have any problem of misunderstand here persistent observation of thi stuff not happen consistent with ht though it may be be more consistent with ha a explain in the bayesian stat post even if ht god exist be unfalsifiable that no problem for my argument other than that you have to let the number of observation go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically btw i do not consider an argument that require an infinite number of observation a valid or rather that part of the argument be not valid we a exist human can never make an infinite number of measurment and any conclusion that reily on thi i do accept a valid that fine i do claim that theism be false merely that the finite number of observation available to me so far suggest that it be and that a i continue to observe the suggestion look better and better renormalization stuff delete in the bayesian stat post i assume that theism wa indeed unfalsifiable in a finite number of observation here the relevant quote the important assumption be that there be some observation which be compatible with the theist hypothesi and not with the atheist hypothesi and thu would falsify atheism these be what i call appearance of but thi need not be take too literally any observation which require for it explanation that one or more god exist will count all other observation be assume to be compatible with both hypothesis thi leaf theism a unfalsifiable and atheism a falsifiable in a single observation only by such appearance of here be my problem with thi for something to be falsifiable it must make the prediction that should not be see if be see then the hypothesi ha be falsify now atheism be a word in oposition to something theism a theism asert a belief and an atheism asert a disbelief so there be certain atheism that be certainly falsifiable just a there be certain theism that be falsifable if my theism assert the world be only year old and that god do not decieve then thi ha be falsify however the atheism that be in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism be also unfalsifiable i could be wrong on thi statment contd i think you be an appearance of be sufficient to falsify atheism wherea in general the correspond theism be unfalsifiable i think more about it until then here be a general question suppse x be unfalsifiable is not x also unfalsifiable no by way of a counterexample let x the coin be fair or more accurately so that not x make sense the two side of the coin be different thi be unfalsifiable by toss the coin even a string of head be consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite number of toss to falsify x in the limit it converse be falsifiable and be falsify when at least one head and at least one tail have appear thi be partly what wrong with you baysian argument which require observation x x n to be make there be simply no such observation that have a truth value in relation to the statement god exist now by use of ymy symmetry argument i can understand why someone would say since the statement do not exist make no prediction i will choose not to believe it but none the le thi would be found on a type of faith or if you do like the word faith insert belief for which there be no falsifiable evidence instead i assume you mean god exist up there at the highlight but by my agree definition of exist the statement make prediction a i say above although it be falsifiable in a finite number of observation actually i mean do not exist make no prediction oop sorry mea culpa the truth of thi statment actually depend upon which god you be refer to but i can think of some conception of god for which it be true but once again i open to the posibility that i could be wrong so give me some example of prediction of the statment god do not exist here be one that i can think of if true then there would be no heal or miricle but thi can in principle never be determine one way or the other there be case in which person seem to recover and be heal without the help of a doctor and for no know reason these situation do in fact happen they be consistent with a theistic hypothesi but in no way support such a hypothesi we agree here they be not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesi i ca think of one prediction from do not exist that be of thi type but i might be miss something the rapture will not happen on october said rapture would have falsify atheism to my satisfaction have it happen although it failure to happen do not of course falsify any theism other than those which specifically predict it no phenomenon which require the existence of one or more god for it explanation will ever be observe that about sum the whole
