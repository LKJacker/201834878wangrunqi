from rashid subject re yet more rushdie re islamic law in article darice fred rice write stuff delete now i do not believe in blindly follow anyone no matter how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law if someone tell me islam say such and such i immediately say show me the support for thi statement from the and sunnah i believe thi to be my islamic duty for accord to one hadith of the prophet peace and bless of god be with him if ymy leader tell you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sin for do wrong even though you be blindly follow the instruction of ymy leader i be responsible for my own action not abu hanifa or imam malik etc even if i be blindly follow the opinion of abu hanifa etc with thi in mind to my understand we must look at the reason behind such opinion of muslim that support khomeini fatwa now to my understand the hadith upon which those who support khomeini fatwa be relate to a particular instance that occur during war time now brother in general it be imho ridiculou and wrong to say that a hadith relate to the action of war be usable during time of peace i think any sensible human be can see thi so i personally think that the reason of some of my ulema in thi matter be faulty for they think it be legitimate to use act of war in time of peace regard thi particular subject if you think i be wrong please feel free to say so with ymy reason from and hadith please not because somebody say so i want the reason from and the sahih hadith perhap we should take my discussion to please email me rashid if you think we should do thi by the way i also disagree with ymy opinion regard the punishment for apostasy the viewpoint i follow that there be in general no punishment for apostasy be very strongly support by and hadith thi be very well show in the book punishment in islamic law by mohamed s el-awa american trust publication i reiterate that i would agree with you that there be little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the in islamic history a well apostasy ha rarely be punish belief be consider a matter of conscience and since there be to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostate have be generally leave to believe or not believe a they will however when an apostate make attack upon god and hi messenger the situation change now the charge of apostasy may be complicate with other charge perhap charge of sedition treason spy etc if the person make a public issue of their apostasy or mount public attack a oppose to arguement against islam the situation be likewise complicate if the person spread slander or broadcast falsehood again the situation change the punishment vary accord to the situation the apostate be in anyhow the charge of aggravate apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in rushdie case there be a distinction in the between a formal war situation and be in the situation where someone unilaterally wage war by their action create disorder make mischief etc against the muslim and create a situation that result in harm to muslim here a small group or even a single individual could be say to be engage in such a practise in other word there be a clear difference between a formal war situation where two clearly define party wage war conclude treaty exchange prisoner etc and deal with attack that come from isolate individual or group against islam it be the second situation the unilateral attack and the spread of fasad that would apply in the case of rushdie the matter of rushdie be not a simple matter of ban an offensive book ban the book be secondary a full set of circumstance follow the publication of the book come into play a well include the death of many muslim and rushdie and hi publisher medium game now i do not believe in blindly follow anyone no matter how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law if someone tell me islam say such and such i immediately say show me the support for thi statement from the and sunnah i believe thi to be my islamic duty for accord to one hadith of the prophet peace and bless of god be with him if ymy leader tell you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sin for do wrong even though you be blindly follow the instruction of ymy leader i be responsible for my own action not abu hanifa or imam malik etc even if i be blindly follow the opinion of abu hanifa etc now to my understand the hadith upon which those who support khomeini fatwa be relate to a particular instance that occur during war time now brother in general it be imho ridiculou and wrong to say that a hadith relate to the action of war be usable during time of peace i think any sensible human be can see thi so i personally think that the reason of some of my ulema in thi matter be faulty for they think it be legitimate to use act of war in time of peace regard thi particular subject i be not sure which hadith you be refer to above i believe that one of the verse on which the fatwa be base be every verse in the ha a correspond circumstance of revelation but in no way be the understand the tafsir of the verse restrict solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it wa reveal if thi wa the case then we could say that all the law and regulation that be reveal when the muslim be not involve in conflict should be suspend when they be at war the logic do not follow in complex real-life situation there may be many verse and many hadith which can all be relate to a single complicate situation the internal relationship between these verse may be quite complex such that arrive at an understand of how the verse interlock and how each apply to the particular situation can be quite a demand task it be not necessarily a simple thi or that proces there may be many parameter involve there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be view all these matter impinge on the situation in other word there be a great deal involve in decipher the the ask u to reflect on it verse but thi reflection must entail more than simply read a verse and it correspond hadith if the reflection be for the sake of increase personal piety then each person ha hi own level of understand and there be no harm in that however if the reflection be in order to decide matter that pertain to the state to the gestation of law and rule to the gestation of society the dispense of justice the guidance of the community then there be certain minimum requirement of understand that one should achieve jaffar ibn muhammad as-sadiq relate some of these requirement a teach by the prophet in a hadith he who do not distinguish in the book of allah the abrogate verse from the abrogate one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguou and do not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and do not recognize a verse of meccan period from a medinite one and do not know the circumstance of revelation and do not understand the technical word of the whether simple or compound and do not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and be ignorant of advance and delay in it verse and do not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the begin from the termination and be unaware of the question and the answer the disjoin and the join and the exception and the all-inclusive and be ignorant of an adjective of a precede noun that explain the subsequent one and be unaware of the emphasize subject and the detail one the obligatory law and the permission the place of the duty and rule and the mean of the lawful and the unlawful and do not know the join word and the word that be relate to those come before them or after them then such a man do not know the nor be he among the person of the based on these and other hadith and in accordance with many verse why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understand tafaqquh in religion and to warn person when they return to them so that they may beware a science of jurisprudence arise the requirement for a person to be consider a mujtahid one who can pronounce on matter of law and religion be many i list a few major division below there be of course many subdivision within these head knowledge of arabic syntax conjugation root semantic oratory knowledge of tafsir and principle of tafsir logic mantiq a knowledge of hadith a knowledge of transmitter rijal knowledge of the principle of juriprudence sunnah consensu reasoning the study of and sunnah for purpose of law involf discussion of imperative awamir discussion of negative imperative nawahi discussion of generality and particularity aam wa kha discussion of unconditional and conditional discussion of tacit mean discussion of the abstract and the clear discussion of the abrogator and the abrogate the principle of application of the law involf principle of exemption principle of precaution principle of option principle of mastery the jurisprudent be bind to go through a very rigorou proces in pronounce judgement on a give situation it be not a matter of look at one verse and one hadith now no one should blindly follow anyone but there be a difference between blind follow and accede to the opinion of someone who be clearly more knowledgeable and more qualify than oneself there be the famou hadith of the prophet in which he say the fuqaha religiou scholar be the trustee of the prophet a long a they do not concern themself with the illicit desire pleasure and wealth of thi world the prophet wa ask o messenger of god how may we know if they so concern themself he reply by see whether they follow the rule power if they do that fear for ymy religion and shun them i do not yet know enough about the imam of the fmy sunni madhab to comment on how thi hadith apply to them or to the contemporary scholar who base themself upon them the prophet also refer to the fuqaha a the fortres of islam my only point be to make it clear that arrive at a legal judgement call into play a certain amount of expertise the specific of thi expertise be delineate in the and hadith those who acquire thi expertise be praise in both the and hadith those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matter that affect society state and religion be caution the only reason i say anything at all about the rushdie affair in thi group be because the whole basi for the discussion of the fatwa that be apostasy wa wrong when one discus something they should at least base their discussion on fact secondly khomeini wa condemn a a heretic because he supposedly claim to be infallible another instance of create a straw man and then beat him perhap we should take my discussion to please email me rashid if you think we should do thi i agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup unfortunately i do not have any acces to email so private discussion or a moderate group be out of the question i can not post to a moderate group like how about or a salaam a-laikum
