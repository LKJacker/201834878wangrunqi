from swf stan friesen subject re after year can we say that christian morality be thi be swf in another indirect post vium dan in article duffy joseph duffy write in article russpj rus paul-jone write the same way that any theory be prove false you examine the predicition that the theory make and try to observe them if you do or if you observe thing that the theory predict would happen then you have some evidence against the theory if the theory ca be modify to incorporate the new observation then you say that it be false but how do one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment in many type of experiment the prediction be that the observe phenomenon will happen again and be capable of be observe for example in chemistry someone may predict the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction repeatedly there be several problem here first you be discuss only experimental procedure observational procedure be also useful the main criterion be attempt to verify an idea by use it to make prediction about as-yet unmake observation the observation could be the result of an experiment or they could be obsevation of activity occur spontaneossly in nature or they could even be observation of the last result of event long past all that matter be that the observation be new thi be what prediction be about in science it be not about predict the future except in thi very restrict sense secondly repeatability can also take many form it be really just the requirement that independent observer be able to verify the result the observation of a fossil be since any qualify observer may look at it thi be why the specimen be reqtined in a museum also there be the implicit prediction that future fossil find will correspond to the current one new fossil be find often enough that thi be test regularly many time a new fossil actually falsify some conclusion make on the basi of previou fossil unfortunately for you the model that be falsify have alway be peripheral to the model of evolution we now have for instance the front leg of tyrannosauru rex turn out to have tremendou muscle rather than be weakly endow a previously believe so in fact histoircal science find be repeatable in the necessary sense just becuase you can not go out and repeat the original event do not make it impossible to make valid observation thi be not to say that biologist would not go coo-coo if extra terrestrial life be discover that could make the determination of the proces of abiogenesi relatively easy sarima formerly tdatirv sarima or sarima formerly tdatirv sarima or
