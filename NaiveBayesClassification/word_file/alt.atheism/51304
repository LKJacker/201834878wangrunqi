subject periodic post of charley challenge with addition from dpw david wood new in thi version challenge plu an addendum summarize charley response to-date thi be a post make periodically in an attempt to encourage charley wingate to addres direct challenge to hi evidently speciou claim i continue to re-post periodically until he answer them publicly indicate that he wo answer them stop post to the community tell me to stop or i get totally bore i apologize for the somewhat juvenile nature of thi approach but i at a los to figure out another way to crack hi intransigence and seem intellectual dishonesty thi be re-post charley i ca help but notice that you have still fail to provide answer to substantive question that have be raise in response to ymy previou post i submit that you do answer them because you can not answer them without run afoul of ymy own logic and i once again challenge you to prove me wrong to make the task a easy for you a possible i present concise re-statement of some of the question that you have fail to answer in the hope that you may addres them one at a time for all to see should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period i will re-post thi article with suitable addition and deletion at such time that i notice a post by you on another topic i will repeat thi procedure until you either addres the outstanding challenge or you cease to post to thi newsgroup i would like to apologize in advance if you have answer any of these question previously and ymy answer miss my notice if you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such article i will be only too please to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it from thi list now to the question after claim that all atheist fit into neat psychological pattern that you propose then semi-retracting that claim by state that you be refer to all atheist i ask you to name some atheist who you feel do fit ymy pattern to show that you indeed be not refer to all atheist that you be aware of you fail to do so please do so now question can you name any poster who do not fit into ymy stereotype here be the context for the question thi be not true for everyone on thi board and you be out of line in assume that it be you however delete the text further along where i say that i do mean to imply that everybody experience wa along the same line whether or not you mean to make such implication you do so repeatedly allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those atheist that you come acros who do not fit into the pattern that you theorize you have take umbrage to statement to the effect that sense and reason be all we have to go by and when press you have imply that we have an alternative call revelation i have repeatedly ask you to explain what revelation be and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without do so vium my sense and reason you fail to do so please do so now question can you explain what be revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without use sense and inherent reason here be the context for the question revelation be not reason and if we do have revelation then reason be not all we have first show me that revelation exist second if revelation be not perceive through the sense how exactly be it perceive according to my webster revelation be an act of reveal or communicate divine truth now tell me how such a thing can be reveal communicate other than vium the sense tell me how you can interpret thi revelation other than with reason that be use ymy brain to interpret what you be sense when i say there be no way for a human be to interface with the universe other than vium the sense a interpret by reason ymy brain it be because thi be the simple truth if you have another mechanism of interface by all mean share it with u then later you can not escape the fact that my entire interface with the universe be my sense and my reason period again thi be indefensible no it be simple truth i challenge you to show me otherwise then later few mystic will agree to thi assertion and the common defense of redefine sense to absorb for instance mystical experience be beg the question of whether some sense be better than other i allow you the broadest definition of sense to make thing easier for you now show me that mystical experience exist remember you be allow to go by testimony of other mystic since you have dismiss my testimony a unreliable you know taint by my own bia further once these mystical thingy be absorb show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation vium that person reason capability i challenge you to show me these thing if you can not do so you might a well give up the fight then later let me reiterate you have not explain ymy interpretation of ymy experience so it be not possible for me to have attack them in point of fact i specifically challenge you to explain thi revelation stuff that you be talk about and i note for the record that you appear to have decline my challenge what be it how be it sense how be it interpret and how do thi sense and interpretation occur without the conduit of my sense and reason ability you have answer none of these question that go straight to the heart of ymy claim if you ca answer them ymy claim be entirely speciou you have state that all claim to dispassionate analysi make by poster be unverifiable and fantastical i ask you to identify one such claim that i have make you have fail to do so please do so now question have i make any claim at all that be unverifiable and fantastical if so please repeat them here be the context for the question i must thank david wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong post then later likewise the reference to unverifiable fantastical claim represent fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claim to dispassionate analysi that be repeat in thi group give me ymy addres and i be please to send you a dictionary failing that can you name one claim that i have make that be in any sense unverifiable or fantastical i demand that you retract thi statement if you can not offer up evidence if you follow ymy usual pattern of ignore the challenge then you be simply an asshole first you dismiss claim by atheist that they become atheist a a result of reason then later you state that if one accept the axiom of reason that one could help but become atheist i ask you to explain the contradiction ymy only response wa a statement that the question wa incoherent an opinion not share by other that i have ask be they atheist or theist you have fail to answer the question please do so now question do you retract ymy claim that poster have not become atheist a a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect if you do retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axiom of reason inevitably result in atheism here be the context for the question first quote we have here a bunch of person who claim that their position be base on reason it be up to atheist to prove it to me then second quote but i do not see how one can accept these axiom and not end up with an atheistic point of view first you claim that you would probably not answer these challenge because they contain too much in the way of include text from previou post later you imply that you would respond because i wa put word in ymy mouth please clarify thi seem contradiction question do you prefer to respond to challenge that include context from ymy own post or that i paraphrase ymy position in order to avoid include text here be the context for the question first you say my ordinary rule be that i do read article over over line or article in which there be nothing but include text on the first screen these be not rule of morality but practicality then later if someone be not go to argue with my version of my position then they can not be argue with a usual ymy response be await with anticipation dave wood for the record below be a compilation of charley response to these challenge to date thi make no sense to me at all it gife the appearance either of utter incoherence or of answer some question of mr wood imagination mr wood i do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet throw down on the net require any response whatsoever at some point i might read and respond to ymy article and then again i might not my ordinary rule be that i do read article over over line or article in which there be nothing but include text on the first screen these be not rule of morality but practicality i leave out something else i do respond to utmost on my list of thing to avoid be argument about the argument meta-argument a some call them when i have to start say that not what i say and the response be do so there no reason to continue if someone be not go to argue with my version of my position then they can not be argue with
