from dgraham dougla graham subject re jew ca hide from keith cco in article livesey jon livesey write in article dgraham dougla graham write the poster casually trash two thousand year of jewish history and ken reply that there have previously be person like him in germany i think the problem here be that i pretty much ignore the part about the jew sightsee for year think instead that the important part of what the original poster say wa the bite about kill palestinian in retrospect i can see how the sightsee thing would be offensive to many i originally saw it just a poetic license but it understandable that other might see it differently i still think that ken come on a bite strong though i also think that ymy advice to masud khan before you argue with someone like mr arromdee it a good idea to do a little homework or at least think wa unnecessary that right there have be there have also be person who be formally nazi but the nazi party would have go nowhere without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the street who behave a though casual anti-semitism wa perfectly acceptable now what exactly do you understand about what i write and why do you see what it ha to do with the matter at hand throughout all ymy article in thi thread there be the tacit assumption that the original poster wa exhibit casual anti-semitism if i agree with that then maybe ymy speech on why thi be bad might have be relevant but i think you read a lot into one flip sentence while probably not true in thi case too often the charge of anti-semitism get throw around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of israel anyway i rather be somewhere else so i outtum thi thread doug graham dgraham my opinion be my own
