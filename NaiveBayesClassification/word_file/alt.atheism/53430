from tgk todd kelley subject re faith and dogma in eov ray bill ray write faith and dogma be inevitable christian merely understand and admit to the fact give me ymy proof that no god exist or that he do whichever position you take you be force to do it on faith it do no good to say you take no position for to show no interest in the existence of god be to assume he do not exist consider special relativity it ha be prove nor ha it be disprove no one ha a proof one way or the other but many person be interest in it i satisfy myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the existence of god one way or the other the two possibility be supernaturalism and naturalism of course no set of circumstance can be inconsistent with supernaturalism but similarly no set of circumstance can be inconsistent with naturalism in naturalism any phenomenon that could be describe a god be consider part of the natural world to be study a any other natural phenomenon gravity for instance for example if a loud godlike voice vociferously announce i be god i exist and i will prove it by reverse the force of gravity and if then gravity do indeed reverse a naturalist probably a scientist would say boy we sure do understand gravity a well a we think we do and that loud voice be something new perhap we do understand thunder a well a we think we do either i contend that proper implementation of the christian faith require reason but that reason can not be use to throw out thing you do like or find uncomfortable hedonistic sexual behavior be condemn in the bible and no act of true reason will make it any le condemn hatred murder gossip all these be condemn is there god-ordained murder in the bible you bet and if god ever order me to kill you i will but i will first use the gideon-like behavior of verify that god actually order the hit and will probably discus it in an abram-like fashion i sure glad you do know where i live since you do seem to realize it be impossible for you to distinguish between voice in ymy head and god voice i can hear you now thi be how jim jone and david koresh justify their behavior delusional religiou cult bear the same relationship to christianity that rape bear to consentual sex form but no substance when the southern baptist church or the methodist church begin to do thi then you have reason to blame mainstream religion for the behavior of these person or should i associate every negative behavior i witnes in any non-christian with you you seem to have miss my point even if jim jone and david koresh be not religiou person my point remain that faith and dogma be dangerou and religion encourage them jim jone and david koresh also encourage them my point do not rely on jim jone and david koresh be religiou todd
