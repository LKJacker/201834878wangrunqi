subject re biblical rape from benedikt rosenau in article strom rob strom write deletion the thread biblical rape wa initiate by david o hunt here be hi post in article david o hunt bluelobster write i pretty sure i see biblical rule for when it allowable to rape prisoner what the code be about that etc could some more knowledgable soul than i please let me know some reference he ask a very narrow question and i give a very narrow answer ye sorry i have get that wrong my apology deletion no david hunt post do mention a god nor do my response you be the first to bring up the idea of the bible be give by god most jew do believe thi in any literal sense so no fun but i must have meet the minority then and give by god refer to any action whereby a god god cause or better effect something rob i be not intimate with jewish theology but i understand that you be a messianic jew correct me if i be wrong but it appear that the view of messianic jew on metaphysic be different to that of the majority of jew while jewish theology overall be quite distinct from the christianic god view i have hear that it be possible for jew to attribute evil to their god an no-no for christian the bible be still see a effect of the interaction of some god with man deletion no i think we agree that though jew disagree there be a set of core belief that they do agree upon one of which be that the commandment be accessible and write in the language of the time and another of which be that there must be a legal system to update them the context wa metaphysic even when the proces of adapt the commandment be not transcendent the justification of the proces lie in metaphysic specualtion i wonder how you break out of the shackle of have metaphysic in ymy system deletion could you explain thi with respect to the original commandment be discuss that be the commandment that say if you feel like rap a woman prisoner you should instead wait and marry her what about the way thi commandment be give invalidate it is be in a book that command to commit genocide among other reprehensible deed the context be repulsive and it be foul play imo to invoke some relatively enlighten passage a an example for the content of the whole book big deletion the point be that i see that there be a necessary connection between the theology you use and the interpretation of the bible only very loosely my interpretation of the bible be base on a long tradition of jewish scholar interpret the bible theology do really enter into it there be jewish atheist who interpret the law of charity essentially the same way i do no not the interpretation of some law but the interpretation of the bible a in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue with god the whole idea that it be metaphorically and yet allow you to argue with a god whatever that mean that alone be a theo logic question be proof of a theology use you pose another metaphysical riddle no you do well you write thi fine so we have some major spirit with neither absolute power nor absolute knowledge and a it appear limit mean or will to communicate with u some form of spiritual big friend do you admit that use god in thi context be somewhat unusual am i right in the assumption that it can not have create the universe a well and that the passage in the bible refer to that or it omnipotence be crap that what i mean by the riddle it be an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh sodom and gomorrha mean either there be some connection between the text the fact that it exist and ymy interpretation of it or it be purely arbitrary further the question be why be ha one to carry the burden of biblical text when one could simply write other book that convey the message better you might answer that one ca becuase some peculiar biblical information might be lose but that hold true of every other book and the question remain why ha the bible still a special place ca it be replace somehow is it ok to bargain the dangerou content of the bible against some other message that be include a well deletion do you see the danger in do so especially with the metapher use in the bible i think the danger of do so be le than either the danger of have a freeze system of law or have no law sorry but there be worse system do not say anything about if one could not have a better system deletion if we read two story about the importance of help the poor and in one god be a spirit and in the other god ha a body which be more important help the poor or resolve the contradiction about the corporeal nature of god if we read two story in the bible one that god command person to kill child for be idolater and another where god kill child directly what be more important to resolve the message that child be to be kill or if it ha to be do by god and the argument you have give be a fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have give to find out if god be corporeal or not it can be crucial in other question religiou believer resolve contradiction with that they choose one of the possibility give in an arbitrary way and have the advantage of be able to attribute their decision to some god one can not resolve question by the statement do what be good when what be good depend on the question benedikt
