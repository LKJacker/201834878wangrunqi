from bil bill conner subject re et al princeton axe match fund for boy scout eczcaw write i jim i alway think that homophobe wa only a word use at act up rally i do beleive real person use it let see if we agree on the term definition a homophobe be one who actively and militantly attack homosexual because he be actually a latent homosexual who use hi hostility to conceal hi true orientation since everyone who disapprove of or condemn homosexuality be a homophobe ymy implication be clear it must necessarily follow that all man be latent homosexual or bisexual at the very least crap crap crap crap crap a definition of any type of come from phobium an irrational fear of hence a homophobe not only in act up meet the word be apparently in general use now or perhap it be in the bible wouldst thou prefer if i be to communicate with thou in bilespeak do an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of be a spider do an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of be a wide open space do you understand english obviously someone who ha phobium will react to it they will do their best to avoid it and if that be not possible they will either strike out or run away or do gaybashing occur because of natural process person who definately have homophobium will either run away from gay person or cause them or themself violence is that what i say what be you take issue with here ymy remark be merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful it would seem odd if homosexuality have any evolutionary function other than limit population growth since evolution only occur when the member of one generation pa along their trait to subsequent generation homosexuality be an evolutionary deadend if i take ymy usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to intend then all man be really homosexual and evolution of my specie at least be go nowhere so every time a man ha sex with a woman they intend to produce child hmm no wonder the world be overpopulate obviously you keep to the monty python song every sperm be sacred and if a you say it ha a purpose a a mean to limit population growth then it be by ymy own arguement natural consider the context i talk about an evolutionary function one of the most basic requirement of evolution be that member of a specie procreate those who do have no purpose in that context another point be that if the offspring of each generation be to survive the participation of both parent be necessary a family must exist since homosexual do not reproduce they can not constitute a family since the majority of humankind be part of a family homosexuality be an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you will well if that be true by ymy own arguement homosexual would have vanish year ago due to non-procreation also the parent from single parent family should put the baby out in the cold now co they must by ymy arguement die by ymy argument homosexuality be genetically determine a to ymy second point you prove again that you have no idea what context mean i be talk about evolution the preservation of the specie the fundamental premise of the whole proces but it get worse since the overwhelm majority of person actually prefer a heterosexual relationship homosexuality be a social abberation a well the homosexual eschew the biological imperative to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in the most fundamental social element the family but wait there more read the above i expect you to have at least ten child by now with the family grow these day sex be le to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be no-one but more to do with pleasure in pre-pill and pre-condom day if you have sex there wa the chance of produce child these day be just ai true person can decide whether or not to have child and when soon they will be able to choose it sex c but that another arguement so it more of a lifestyle decision again by ymy arguement since homosexual can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to person who decide to have sex but not child both be a unnatural a each other yet another non-sequitur sex be an evolutionary function that exist for procreation that it be also recreation be incidental that homosexual do procreate mean that sex be only recreation and nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose since homosexual have come out the closet and have convince some policy maker that they have civil right they be now claim that their sexuality be a preference a life-style an orientation a choice that should be protect by law now if homosexuality be a mere choice and if it be both contrary to nature and anti-social then it be a perverse choice they have even le credibility than before they become prominent person be person be person who be you to tell anyone else how to live their life are you god tm if so fancy a date here pretty obviou dodge do you really think you say anything or do you just feel obligate to respond to every statement i be not tell anyone anything i be demonstrate that there be argument against the practice of homosexuality provide it a merely an alternate lifestlye that be not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand i realize of course that thi come dangerously close to establish a value and that atheist be compel to object on that basi but if you be to be consistent you have no case in thi regard to characterize any opposition to homosexuality a homophobic be to ignore some very compel argument against the legitimization of the homosexual life-style but since the charge be only intend to intimidate it really just demogoguery and not to be take seriously fact be jim there be far more persuasive argument for suppress homosexuality than those give but consider thi a start again crap all ymy argument be base on outdated ideal likewise the bible would any honest christian condemn the ten generation spawn by a bastard to eternal damnation or someone who crush hi peni either accidently or not both be in deuteronomy i sure ymy comment pertain to something but you disguise it so well i ca see what where do i mention ideal out-dated or otherwise ymy argument be very reactionary do you have anything at all to contribute a to why homosexual should be exclude from participation in scout the reason be the same a those use to restrict them from teach by their own logic homosexual be deviate social and biological since any adult be a role model for a child it be incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolate from those who would do the child harm in thi case harm mean primarily social though that could be extend easily enough you show me anyone who ha sex in a way that everyone would describe a normal and will take of my hat puma baseball cap to you one man meat be another man poison what ha thi get to do with anything would you pick a single point that you find offensive and explain ymy objection i would really like to believe that you can discus thi issue intelligibly bill
