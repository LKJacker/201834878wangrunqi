from perry jim perry subject re is morality constant wa re biblical rape my last response in thi thread fell into a bit-bucket and vanish though appear locally i repost it since i alway feel slight when someone appear to ignore one of my post in a conversational thread i do want rob to think i do so since thi be now date however do feel compel to respond in article strom rob strom write i wa make two separate point both of which attack face value bible interpretation to judge the bible value today you judge it base on the way it be use today that be what do commentator actually say what do rabbi teach etc i suspect you mean thi in context of the jewish tradition you have be refer to one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition like thi be what happen when a schism occur and over time certain large and influential branch of the heretical group come to favor exactly a face value interpretation to judge the bible value when originally write you a read it in the context of it time not with today assumption and b compare it to the practice of surround person while the context of the time be important value judgment must ultimately be accord to current understand or at least to some base standard relative of a society thi be obviously true in compare it to practice of surround person for instance accord to the bible the surround person be immoral savage with repulsive and inhuman habit we need to look rather at what those people be really like for instance in what way be it better to worship a single god whose presence be symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple god some of whose presence be symbolically represent in a statue by the bible own term idolatry be inherently evil but i see no evidence that the follower of the variou other religion of the area and time be particularly bad person relative to the person in the bible scissor and cloth now in the past my ancestor do cut cloth with scissor but they at least know that their inhumane neighbor cut it with their bare tooth so thi wa a relatively enlighten step forward from their earlier barbarism and make the transition to modern civilize paper-cutting that much easier sound good but it presuppose teeth-rending neighbor which i see no support for one can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane neighbor can be use to make moral point but that do mean that the actual neighbor really be inhuman more to the point such dehumanization of the person acros the river or over the mountain or even of a different person dwell among u be all too common that complex and benign moral tradition have evolve base on particular mythic interpretation of that history be interest but i still do think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history note that i speak of historical interpretation here for instance claim that hammurabi an eye for an eye wa primitive brutal retribution while mosis version wa an enlighten benign fine because the tradition ha since interpret the phrase that way a of year ago or so they probably both mean the same thing to be sure i argue from a parochial perspective i belong to thi tiny tribe which ha struggle against overwhelm odd for survival a a distinct tribe and thi book be the book of my tribe the book command u to dedicate ourself to study to improve the world and to set an example a a light to the nation we revere the book and i think we be successful a scientist a artist and musician a leader in important humanitarian cause it hard for me to separate the succes of my person from the virtue of my book you have to argue that we have do significantly better with a different book or with no book or that another tribe with a different book or with no book ha do significantly better i do belittle the accomplishment particularly the intellectual one of the jewish person i have give up on try to think by analogy since i do know of any other that be at all similar the closest i can think of be the romany but i do know enough about them to make a meaningful comparison i think a tradition of reflective study of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation be a good thing i think that with such an attitude a case could be make that you could have do a well start with a captain america comic or whatever the babylonian equivalent would have be jim perry perry decision support inc matthew nc these be my opinion for a nominal fee they can be your jim perry perry decision support inc matthew nc these be my opinion for a nominal fee they can be your
