from frank frank subject re theism and fanatism wa islamic genocide in article benedikt rosenau write in article frank frank write theism be strongly correlate with irrational belief in absolute irrational belief in absolute be strongly correlate with fanatism deletion theism be correlate with fanaticism i have neither say that all fanatism be cause by theism nor that all theism lead to fanatism the point be theism increase the chance of become a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatic tend toward theism for example but i just have to loook at the time in history when theism wa the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that be the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidate ymy assumption that theism be the factor to be consider bogu i just say that theism be not the only factor for fanatism the point be that theism be a factor that ymy claim now back it up i consider ymy argument a useful a the follow belief be strongly correlate with fanaticism therefore belief be a factor in fanaticism true and utterly useles note thi be any belief not belief in god gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on be all more reliable indicator and the really dangerou person the source of fanaticism be often none of these thing they be cynical manipulator of the gullible who know precisely what they be do that a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leader believe what they say if you believe that you incredibly naive now some brand of theism and more precisely some theist do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theist with thi brush be bigotry not a reason argument and it read to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction of religiou freedom ever read animal farm that a straw man and a usually in discussion with you one ha to repeat it read what i have write above not every theism lead to fanatism and not all fanatism be cause by theism the point be there be a correlation and it come from innate feature of theism no some of it come from feature which some theism ha in common with some fanaticism ymy last statement simply be imply by what you say before because you try to sneak in innate feature of all theism the word you grope for be some gullibility by the way be one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seem a whole lot more relevant to the case you have a oppose to the case you be try to make and to say that i be go to forbid religion be another of ymy straw man interesting that you have nothing better to offer i say it read like a warm up to that that because it an irrational and bogu tirade and ha no other use than create a nice split in the mind of excitable person such a be to be find on either side of church wall define irrational belief be it rational to believe that reason be alway useful irrational belief be belief that be not base upon reason the latter ha be discuss for a long time with charley wingate one point be that the belief violate reason often and another that a proces that do not lend itself to rational analysi do not contain reliable information well there be a glare paradox here an argument that reason be useful base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would be irrational which be it that bogu self reference be not circular and since the evaluation of usefulnes be possible within rational system it be allow it oval it still beg the question however and though that certainly be allow it not rational and you claim to be rational and all at the risk of repeat myself and hear we have that before we do hear a refutation before so we back deal with it you ca use reason to demonstrate that reason be useful someone who think reason be crap wo buy it you see ymy argument be a silly a prove mathematical statement need mathematics and mathematics be therfore circular anybody else think godel wa silly the first part of the second statement contain no information because you do say what the belief be if the belief be strong theism strong atheism then ymy statement be not in general true the second part of ymy sentence be patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum do not lend itself to rational analysi but be assume to contain reliable information regardles of what proces be use to obtain it i be speak of religiou system with contradictory definition of god here an axiomatic datum lend itself to rational analysi what you say here be a an often refute fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axiom in larger system out of which they be usually derive i exist be derive if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axiom what be it you be try to say that at some point person alway wind up say thi datum be reliable for no particular reason at all example i be not dream compared the evidence theist have for their claim to the strength of their demand make the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i ca agree with thi until you be specific which theism to say that all theism be necessarily antirational require a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of god personal supernatural entity with objective effect on thi world usually connect to moral the way the world work imo any belief about such god be necessarily irrational that do not mean that person who hold them be in principle oppose to the exercise of intelligence some atheist be also scientist for example the affinity to fanatism be easily see it ha to be true because i believe it be nothing more than a work hypothesi however the belief say they be more than a work hypothesi i do understand thi can you formalise ymy argument person a believe system b becuase it sound so nice that do not make b true it be at best a work hypothesi however the content of b be that it be true and that it be more than a work hypothesi testing or evaluate evidence for or against it therefore dismiss because b already believe say it be wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further content of b be to be kill thi can have interest effect peculiar definition of interest but sure now show that a belief in god entail the further content of which you speak why be my catholic neighbour out kill the protestant for example maybe they do believe in it maybe it the conjunction of b assert b and dissenter that be important and the belief in god be entirely irrelevant it certainly seem so to me but then i have no axe to grind here frank not hatch that odwyer from hen by evelyn conlon
