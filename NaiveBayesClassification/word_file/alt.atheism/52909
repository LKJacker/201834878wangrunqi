from mathew mathew subject faq constructing a logical argument archive-name alt-atheism-archive-name logic last-modified april version constructing a logical argument although there be much argument on usenet the general quality of argument find be poor thi article attempt to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improve the general level of debate logic be the science of reason proof think or inference concise oed logic allow u to analyze a piece of reason and determine whether it be correct or not valid or invalid of course one do not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheles a little basic knowledge of logic be often helpful when construct or analyze an argument note that no claim be be make here about whether logic be universally applicable the matter be very much open for debate thi document merely explain how to use logic give that you have already decide that logic be the right tool for the job proposition or statement be the build block of a logical argument a proposition be a statement which be either true or false for example it be rain or today be tuesday proposition may be either assert say to be true or deny say to be false note that thi be a technical mean of deny not the everyday mean the proposition be the mean of the statement not the particular arrangement of word use to expres it so god exist and there exist a god both expres the same proposition an argument be to quote the monty python sketch a connect series of statement to establish a definite proposition an argument consist of three stage first of all the proposition which be necessary for the argument to continue be state these be call the premise of the argument they be the evidence or reason for accept the argument and it conclusion premise or assertion be often indicate by phrase such a because since obviously and so on the phrase obviously be often view with suspicion a it can be use to intimidate other into accept suspiciou premise if something do seem obviou to you do be afraid to question it you can alway say oh ye you right it be obviou when you hear the explanation next the premise be use to derive further proposition by a proces know a inference in inference one proposition be arrive at on the basi of one or more other proposition already accept there be variou form of valid inference the proposition arrive at by inference may then be use in further inference inference be often denote by phrase such a imply that or therefore finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which be affirm on the basi of the premise and inference conclusion be often indicate by phrase such a therefore it follow that we conclude and so on the conclusion be often state a the final stage of inference for example every event ha a cause premise the universe ha a begin premise all begin involve an event premise thi imply that the begin of the universe involve an event inference therefore the universe ha a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument a proposition can only be call a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the term do not make sense in isolation sometime an argument will not follow the order give above for example the conclusion might be state first and the premise state afterward in support of the conclusion thi be perfectly valid if sometime a little confuse recognizing an argument be much harder than recognize premise or conclusion many person shower their write with assertion without ever produce anything which one might reasonably describe a an argument some statement look like argument but be not for example if the bible be accurate jesu must either have be insane an evil liar or the son of god thi be not an argument it be a conditional statement it do not assert the premise which be necessary to support what appear to be it conclusion it also suffer from a number of other logical flaw but we come to those later another example god create you therefore do ymy duty to god the phrase do ymy duty to god be not a proposition since it be neither true nor false therefore it be not a conclusion and the sentence be not an argument finally causality be important consider a statement of the form a because b if we interest in establish a and b be offer a evidence the statement be an argument if we try to establish the truth of b then it be not an argument it be an explanation for example there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start thi be an argument my car will not start because there be something wrong with the engine thi be an explanation there be two traditional type of argument deductive and inductive a deductive argument be one which provide conclusive proof of it conclusion that be an argument where if the premise be true the conclusion must also be true a deductive argument be either valid or invalid a valid argument be define a one where if the premise be true then the conclusion be true an inductive argument be one where the premise provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive argument be not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they be better or worse than other argument and about how probable their premise be there be form of argument in ordinary language which be neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive argument a they be often view a the most rigorou and convince it be important to note that the fact that a deductive argument be valid do not imply that it conclusion hold thi be because of the slightly counter-intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously a valid argument can consist of true proposition however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contain only false proposition for example all insect have wing premise woodlouse be insect premise therefore woodlouse have wing conclusion here the conclusion be not true because the argument premise be false if the argument premise be true however the conclusion would be true the argument be thu entirely valid more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premise a in all fish live in the sea premise dolphin be fish premise therefore dolphin live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we can not do be reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premise we can therefore draw up a truth table for implication the symbol denote implication a be the premise b the conclusion t and f represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference a b a b f f t if the premise be false and the inference f t t valid the conclusion can be true or false t f f if the premise be true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid t t t if the premise be true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true a sound argument be a valid argument whose premise be true a sound argument therefore arrife at a true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid argument with sound argument to delve further into the structure of logical argument would require lengthy discussion of linguistic and philosophy it be simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfall to be avoid when construct an argument these pitfall be know a fallacy in everyday english the term fallacy be use to refer to mistake belief a well a to the faulty reason that lead to those belief thi be fair enough but in logic the term be generally use to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appear valid or convince so for the purpose of thi discussion we define a fallacy a a logical argument which appear to be correct but which can be see to be incorrect when examine more closely by study fallacy we aim to avoid be mislead by them the follow list of fallacy be not intend to be exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force be commit when the arguer resort to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion it be often use by politician and can be summarize a might make right the force threaten need not be a direct threat from the arguer for example thu there be ample proof of the truth of the bible all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem be literally argument direct at the man the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occur when instead of try to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attack the person or person make the assertion thi be invalid because the truth of an assertion do not depend upon the goodnes of those assert it for example atheism be an evil philosophy it be practise by communist and murderer sometime in a court of law doubt be cast upon the testimony of a witnes by show for example that he be a know perjurer thi be a valid way of reduce the credibility of the testimony give by the witnes and not argumentum ad hominem however it do not demonstrate that the witnes testimony be false to conclude otherwise be to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in thi list the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem be commit when a person argue that hi opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent particular circumstance for example it be perfectly acceptable to kill animal for food how can you argue otherwise when you quite happy to wear leather shoe thi be an abusive charge of inconsistency use a an excuse for dismiss the opponent argument thi fallacy can also be use a a mean of reject a conclusion for example of course you would argue that positive discrimination be a bad thing you white thi particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one allege that one adversary be rationalize a conclusion form from selfish interest be also know a poison the well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium mean argument from ignorance thi fallacy occur whenever it be argue that something must be true simply because it ha not be prove false or equivalently when it be argue that something must be false because it ha not be prove true note that thi be not the same a assume that something be false until it ha be prove true a basic scientific principle example of course the bible be true nobody can prove otherwise of course telepathy and other psychic phenomenon do not exist nobody ha show any proof that they be real note that thi fallacy do not apply in a court of law where one be generally assume innocent until prove guilty also in scientific investigation if it be know that an event would produce certain evidence of it have occur the absence of such evidence can validly be use to infer that the event do not occur for example a flood a describe in the bible would require an enormou volume of water to be present on the earth the earth do not have a tenth a much water even if we count that which be freeze into ice at the pole therefore no such flood occur in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something ha not occur we can not conclude with certainty that it ha not occur however argumentum ad misericordiam thi be the appeal to pity also know a special pleading the fallacy be commit when the arguer appeal to pity for the sake of get a conclusion accept for example i do not murder my mother and father with an axe please do find me guilty i suffer enough through be an orphan argumentum ad populum thi be know a appealing to the gallery or appealing to the person to commit thi fallacy be to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appeal to a large group of person thi form of fallacy be often characterize by emotive language for example pornography must be ban it be violence against woman the bible must be true million of person know that it be are you try to tell them that they be all mistake fool argumentum ad numeram thi fallacy be closely relate to the argumentum ad populum it consist of assert that the more person who support or believe a proposition the more likely it be that that proposition be correct argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority use the admiration of the famou to try and win support for an assertion for example isaac newton wa a geniu and he believe in god thi line of argument be not alway completely bogu for example reference to an admit authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between stephen hawking ha conclude that black hole give off radiation and john searle ha conclude that it be impossible to build an intelligent computer hawking be a physicist and so we can reasonably expect hi opinion on black hole radiation to be inform searle be a linguist so it be questionable whether he be well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident be commit when a general rule be apply to a particular case whose accidental circumstance mean that the rule be inapplicable it be the error make when one go from the general to the specific for example christian generally dislike atheist you be a christian so you must dislike atheist thi fallacy be often commit by moralist and legalist who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically apply general rule converse accident hasty generalization thi fallacy be the reverse of the fallacy of accident it occur when one form a general rule by examine only a few specific case which be not representative of all possible case for example jim bakker wa an insincere christian therefore all christian be insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter a sweep generalization occur when a general rule be apply to a particular situation in which the feature of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable a sweep generalization be the opposite of a hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these be know a false cause fallacy the fallacy of non causa pro causa occur when one identify something a the cause of an event but it ha not actually be show to be the cause for example i take an aspirin and pray to god and my headache disappear so god cure me of the headache the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occur when something be assume to be the cause of an event merely because it happen before the event for example the soviet union collapse after take up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reason cum hoc ergo propter hoc thi fallacy be similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it assert that because two event occur together they must be causally relate and leaf no room for other factor that may be the cause s of the event petitio principius thi fallacy occur when the premise be at least a questionable a the conclusion reach circulu in demonstrando thi fallacy occur when one assume a a premise the conclusion which one wish to reach often the proposition will be rephrase so that the fallacy appear to be a valid argument for example homosexual must not be allow to hold government office hence any government official who be reveal to be a homosexual will lose hi job therefore homosexual will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore homosexual can not be allow to hold government office note that the argument be entirely circular the premise be the same a the conclusion an argument like the above ha actually be cite a the reason for the british secret service official ban on homosexual employee another example be the classic we know that god exist because the bible tell u so and we know that the bible be true because it be the word of god complex question fallacy of interrogation thi be the fallacy of presupposition one example be the classic load question have you stop beat ymy wife the question presuppose a definite answer to another question which ha not even be ask thi trick be often use by lawyer in cross-examination when they ask question like where do you hide the money you steal similarly politician often ask load question such a how long will thi ec interference in my affair be allow to continue or do the chancellor plan two more year of ruinou privatization ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consist of claim that an argument support a particular conclusion when it be actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example a christian may begin by say that he will argue that the teach of christianity be undoubtably true if he then argue at length that christianity be of great help to many person no matter how well he argue he will not have show that christian teach be true sadly such fallaciou argument be often successful because they arouse emotion which cause other to view the suppose conclusion in a more favourable light equivocation equivocation occur when a key word be use with two or more different mean in the same argument for example what could be more affordable than free software but to make sure that it remain free that user can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will alway be freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occur when the premise use in an argument be ambiguou because of careles or ungrammatical phrase accent accent be another form of fallacy through shift mean in thi case the mean be change by alter which part of a statement be emphasize for example consider we should not speak ill of my friend and we should not speak ill of my friend fallacy of composition one fallacy of composition be to conclude that a property share by the part of something must apply to the whole for example the bicycle be make entirely of low ma component and be therefore very lightweight the other fallacy of composition be to conclude that a property of a number of individual item be share by a collection of those item for example a car use le petrol and cause le pollution than a bu therefore car be le environmentally damage than bus fallacy of division the fallacy of division be the opposite of the fallacy of composition like it opposite it exist in two variety the first be to assume that a property of some thing must apply to it part for example you be study at a rich college therefore you must be rich the other be to assume that a property of a collection of item be share by each item for example ant can destroy a tree therefore thi ant can destroy a tree the slippery slope argument thi argument state that should one event occur so will other harmful event there be no proof make that the harmful event be cause by the first event for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we have a nation full of drug-addict on welfare therefore we can not legalize marijuana a is based on b fallacy is a type of fallacy these fallacy occur when one attempt to argue that thing be in some way similar without actually specify in what way they be similar example is history base upon faith if so then be the bible also a form of history islam be base on faith christianity be base on faith so be islam a form of christianity cat be a form of animal base on carbon chemistry dog be a form of animal base on carbon chemistry so be dog a form of cat affirmation of the consequent thi fallacy be an argument of the form a imply b b be true therefore a be true to understand why it be a fallacy examine the truth table for implication give earlier denial of the antecedent thi fallacy be an argument of the form a imply b a be false therefore b be false again the truth table for implication make it clear why thi be a fallacy note that thi fallacy be different from non causa pro causa the latter ha the form a imply b a be false therefore b be false where a do not in fact imply b at all here the problem be not that the implication be invalid rather it be that the falsenes of a do not allow u to deduce anything about b converting a conditional thi fallacy be an argument of the form if a then b therefore if b then a argumentum ad antiquitam thi be the fallacy of assert that something be right or good simply because it be old or because that the way it alway be argumentum ad novitam thi be the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it be the fallacy of assert that something be more correct simply because it be new or newer than something else argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believe that money be a criterion of correctnes that those with more money be more likely to be right argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assume that because someone be poor he or she be sounder or more virtuou than one who be wealthier thi fallacy be the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam thi be the incorrect belief that an assertion be more likely to be true the more often it be hear an argumentum ad nauseum be one that employ constant repetition in assert something bifurcation also refer to a the black and white fallacy bifurcation occur when one present a situation a have only two alternative where in fact other alternative exist or can exist plurium interrogationum many question thi fallacy occur when a questioner demand a simple answer to a complex question non sequitur a non-sequitur be an argument where the conclusion be draw from premise which be not logically connect with it red herring thi fallacy be commit when irrelevant material be introduce to the issue be discuss so that everyone attention be divert away from the point be make toward a different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occur when an abstract concept be treat a a concrete thing shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof be alway on the person make an assertion or proposition shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium be the fallacy of put the burden of proof on the person who deny or question the assertion be make the source of the fallacy be the assumption that something be true unles prove otherwise straw man the straw man fallacy be to misrepresent someone else position so that it can be attack more easily then to knock down that misrepresent position then to conclude that the original position ha be demolish it be a fallacy because it fail to deal with the actual argument that have be make the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often occur when some suggest general rule be be argue over the fallacy be to assume that mention two different situation in an argument about a general rule constitute a claim that those situation be analogou to each other thi fallacy be best explain use a real example from a debate about anti-cryptography legislation i believe it be alway wrong to oppose the law by break it such a position be odiou it imply that you would not have support martin luther king are you say that cryptography legislation be a important a the struggle for black liberation how dare you tu quoque thi be the famou you too fallacy it occur when an action be argue to be acceptable because the other party ha perform it for instance you just be randomly abusive so you be abusive too
