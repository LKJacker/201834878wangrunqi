from bob robert singleton subject re american and evolution in article benedikt rosenau write in article bob robert singleton write deletion i will argue that ymy latter statement i believe that no god exist do rest upon faith that be if you be make a positive statement that no god exist strong atheism rather than merely say i do know and therefore do believe in them and do not believe in then weak atheism once again to not believe in god be different than say i believe that god do not exist i still maintain the position even after read the faq that strong atheism require faith no it in the way it be usually use in my view you be say here that drive a car require faith that the car drife i not say thi at all it require no faith on my part to say the car drife because i see it drive i do more than at in fact i actually drive it now what do require some faith be the belief that my sense give an accurate representation of what out there but there be no evidence pro or con for the existence or non-existence of god see what i have to say below on thi for me it be a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i have in the premise and the argument use sorry if i remain skeptical i do believe it entirely a conclusion that you have see no evidence that there is a god be correct neither have i but lack of evidence for the existence of something be in no way evidence for the non-existence of something the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation you personally have never see a neutrino before but they exist the pink unicorn analogy break down and be rather naive i have a scientific theory that explain the appearance of animal life evolution when i draw the conclusion that pink unicorn do exist because i have see them thi conclusion ha it foundation in observation and theory a pink unicorn if it do exist would be qualitatively similar to other know entity that be to say since there be good evidence that all life on earth ha evolve from more primitive ancestor these pink unicorn would share a common anscestory with horse and zebra and such god however ha no such correspondence with anything imo there be no physical frame work of observation to draw any conclusion from but first let me say the follow we might have a language problem here in regard to faith and existence i a a christian maintain that god do not exist to exist mean to have be in space and time god do not have be god is being kierkegaard once say that god do not exist he be eternal with thi say i feel it rather pointles to debate the so call existence of god and that be not what i do here i believe that god be the source and grind of be when you say that god do not exist i also accept thi statement but we obviously mean two different thing by it however in what follow i will use the phrase the existence of god in it sense and thi be the sense that i think you be use it i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of god no that a word game i disagree with you profoundly on thi i have define god a existence in fact i have define god but thi might be get off the subject although if you think it relevant we can come back to it further say god be existence be either a waste of time existence be already use and there be no need to replace it by god or you be imply more with it in which case ymy definition and ymy argument so far be incomplete make it a fallacy you be use wrong category here or perhap you misunderstand what i say i make no argument what so ever and offer no definition so there be no fallacy i not try to convince you of anything i believe and that rest upon faith and it be inappropriate to apply the category of logic in thi realm unles someone tell you that they can logically prove god or that they have evidence or then the use of logic to disprove their claim if fine and necessary btw an incomplete argument be not a fallacy some thing be not even wrong deletion one can never prove that god do or do not exist when you say that you believe god do not exist and that thi be an opinion base upon observation i will have to ask what observtion be you refer to there be no observation pro or con that be valid here in establish a positive belief deletion where do that follow are observation base on the assumption that something exist i do follow you here certainly one can make observation of thing that they do know exist i still maintain that one can not use observation to infer that god do not exist such a positive assertion require a leap and would you say there be a level of definition that the assumption god be be meaningful if not i would reject that concept anyway so where be ymy evidence for that god be be meaningful at some level once again you seem to completely misunderstand me i have no evidence that be be meaningful at any level maybe such a response a you give just come naturally to you because so many person try to run their own private conception of god down ymy throat i however be not do thi i be argue one and only one thing that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against require a leap it require faith i be a you would say a theist however there be a form of atheism that i can respect but it must be found upon honesty
