from keith keith allan schneider subject re keith schneider stealth poster cmtan tan chade meng dan write i somewhat agree with u however what it come to theist religion it a different matter that because religion be like a drug once u use it it very difficult to get out of it that because in order to experience a religion u necessarily have to have blind faith and once u have the blind faith it very diffcult for you to reason yourself back to atheism again therefore it unreasonable to ask person to try religion in order to judge it it like ask person to try die to find out what death be like well now we ca judge death until we be dead right so why should we judge religion without have experience it person have say that religion be bad by any account and that it be in no way useful etc but i do totally agree with thi of course we can not really say how the religiou folk would act have they not be expose to religion but some person at least seem to be help in some way by it so basically we can not judge whether religion be the right route for a give individual or even for a general population we can say that it be not best for u personally at least you can choose not to use religion might be hard to try to find out it benefit a you state above keith
