from rashid subject re yet more rushdie re islamic law in article davec dave choweller write in article rashid write stuff delete the point of my post wa that rushdie wa not be condemn solely for the word in hi book although thi wa certainly a contribute factor it wa the whole series of action of rushdie and hi publisher follow the publication of the book and the initial medium spotlight place on the book that in large part lead to the fatwa the kind of fatwa level against rushdie be not lightly place and there be any number of anti-islamic writer both within and outside the islamic world who have not have fatwa make against them here someone who add fuel to an explosive situation might be charge with incitement to riot if person die in the riot the charge against him might become even more seriou how can rushdie be blame for the death of person who be demonstrate against him the death should be blame on the person who deal with the demonstration or on the demonstrator themself if they be violent to what length will you go to justify thi barbaric behavimy against rushdie once the rushdie situation explode into the medium the muslim voice on the matter of the book wa effectively restrict to short video byte show the dramatic highlight of muslim demonstration for every twenty or so newspaper magazine article interview etc support rushdie there would appear one muslim voice thi person wa usually select base on how dramatic and incoherent he wa not on hi knowledge of islam or the situation at the time thi approx twenty to one ratio continue throughout the escalation of the crisi with rushdie in the central spotlight a the man of the moment the valiant defender of everyman right to free speech decouple from responsibility a an aside it interest that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech go up some book defame certain ethnic and religiou group continue to be ban here it wa felt that they injure the sensibility of these group and present a false image which could promote feel of hate toward these group for muslim thi kind of double standard wa annoy rushdie saw thi spotlight a a golden opportunity to lash out at organize islam and he do so with admirable verbal skill the only kind of islam which rushdie find palatable be what he call a secular islam an islam separate from it it prophet god it legislation and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena fine rushdie make hi view know the muslim make their anger at hi book know the scale of the whole affair erupt into global proportion it wa by thi time already a political situation affect government a well a individual the situation wa a seriou one with far-reaching political implication at the centre of thi turmoil wa rushdie throw fuel on the fire engage in a personal crusade that make him obliviou to any sense of caution now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such a thi ha no responsibility ha no reason to exercise restraint of any kind ha no obligation to perhap step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matter calm down perhap you even feel that he be justify in boldly defy the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at hi literary work no matter what insult they find within it perhap you see him a a kind of secular heroic knight mount on the hi medium steed do battle with the dragon of islamic fundamentalism well khomeini saw him a a disingeneou author who grow up in a muslim atmosphere know well what muslim hold dear who write a book which mischievously use certain literary convention to slander insult and attack islam and it most notable personality who when face with a situation that become a worldwide crisi continue with hi mischief in the world stage of the medium who even after person be injure and kill because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation continue hi mischief instead of have the good sense to desist khomeini saw the crisi a mischief make on a grand scale mischief make that grow in scale a the scale of the crisi enlarge the death of muslim around the world and rushdie continue medium mischief even after thi wa the trigger factor that seem to decide khomeini on put a stop to the mischief the person at the centre of all these event wa rushdie he wa the source of the continue mischief all medium support government support wa just that support the source wa rushdie and hi publisher who be nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and be very happy to see rushdie constantly in the medium the islamic rule that deal with person who engage in thi kind of grand-scale mischief make wa apply to rushdie you attempt at justification be not do the image of islam any good i have make no attempt at justification only at explanation image be the chief concern of muslim for islam and for rushdie if muslim willingly relegate themself to become a sub-culture within a larger secular culture such that the secular principle and law have precedence over the law of islam then i have no doubt that islam would then be think to have a good image principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image a good image usually mean be more like me ymy attempt at totally exonerate rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that result in the polarization bring about by the crisi in iran the situation wa monitor for many month when rushdie keep add fuel to the flame through the free worldwide voice that the medium give him the situation wa monitor more seriously when even after many death occur worldwide rushdie still do not desist the fatwa wa pronounce when behave like a total jerk endanger life and the jerk see thi and still insist on hi right to behave like a total jerk he ha the rug jerk out from under him if the muslim do make such a big fus over the book like issue death threat and kill publisher no one would have heard of it the fatwa come later much later if rushdie do mouth off so much in the medium the fus would have die down no one would have be kill no fatwa would have be pass the whole episode would have fizzle away
