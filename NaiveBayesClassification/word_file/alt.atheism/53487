from benedikt rosenau subject re after year can we say that christian morality be in article lvus frank frank write deletion and if a real large lot nice phrase of person agree that there be a football on a desk i suppose to see a logical difference between the two perhap you can explain the difference to me since you seem to see it so clearly rest delete that a fallacy and it be not the first time it be point out it not a fallacy note the if if a supermajority of disinterested person agree on a fundamantal value we not do ethic yet benedikt then what be the difference between that and those person agree on a trivial observation the reference to it not yet be ethic be dubiou you have use the term absolute objective and other interchangeably same with moral value value at all worth measuer and usefulnes you infer from them a if they be the same to the if when the if be not fulfil ymy intermission be a waste of time assuming that you do intend thi it be reasonable to conclude that you want to argue a point you have make a interest statement here namely that of the disinterested observer there be no such thing in moral probably the shortest proof for objective and morality be a contradiction for one you have never give a set of moral person agree upon unlike a football further you conveniently ignore here that there be many who would not agree on tghe morality of something the analogy do not hold i have however give an example of a value person agree on and explain why person will agree that their freedom be valuable i have also state that such a value be a necessary condition for do objective ethic the if assertion above and that be what i talk about there be a point in talk about ethic if thi ca be agree fine and that freedom be valuable be not generally agree upon i could name quite a lot of person who state the opposite not that that wa mention before in other word you have nothing to fulfill ymy strong claim with one can expect sufficiently many person to agree on it be a football while you have to give the evidence that only vanish number disagree with a set of moral you have to give i not do moral ethic if we ca get past value a i say the only cogent objection to my example be that maybe person be talk about the same thing when they answer that it be valuable maybe not and i want to think about thi some especially the implication of it be true clutching a straw i do believe in map into metaphysical set be load term be fixpoint those who deny the morality of freedom make quite clear what they say their practice be tell ye there be even those who be willingly unfree it be quite common in religion by the way for one there be a religion which be name submission do even try to argue that submission be freedom further the above be evidence not proof proof would evolve out of test ymy theory of absolute moral against compete theory garbage that not proof either if it be so it would argue my case but i be afraid that that be consider proof the above be one of the argument you reiterate while you never answer the objection evidence that you be a preacher name that fallacy there be something universally value in a moral context benedikt
