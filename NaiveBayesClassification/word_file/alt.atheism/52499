definitive the purpose of the periodic faq post be not to stifle debate but to raise it level if you have something to say concern one of these question and which be cover by the answer give please feel free to make ymy point overview of content what be the purpose of thi newsgroup hitler wa an atheist the bible prove it pascal wager what be occam razor why it good to believe in jesu why i know that god exist einstein and god do not play dice everyone worship something why there must be a causeles cause the universe be so complex it must have be design independent evidence that the bible be true godel incompletenes theorem george bush on atheism and patriotism i know where hell be biblical contradiction want the usa be a christian nation the usa be not a christian nation subject what be the purpose of thi newsgroup typical post why have a newsgroup about atheism why do atheist organize in group what be there to discus response many thing be discuss here include whether it be reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upset one family prayer in school discrimination against atheist sunday trade law the satanic child abuse myth whether one should be an overt atheist or in the closet how religiou society prey sic on new college student how to get rid of unwanted proselytizer whether religion be a danger to society the individual why person become atheist of course inevitably tend to attract evangelical christian look for someone to convert most reader of the newsgroup do want to be preach to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tear apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed post subject hitler wa an atheist typical post hitler wa an atheist and look at what he do response adolf hitler wa emphatically not an atheist a he say himself the folkish-minded man in particular ha the sacred duty each in hi own denomination of make and orig ital for god will give man their form their essence and their ability anyone who destroy hi work be declare war on the lord creation the divine will therefore let every man be active each in hi own denomination if you please and let every man take it a hi first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in hi activity by word or deed step outside the confine of hi religiou community and try to butt into the other hence today i believe that i be act in accordance with the will of the almighty creator orig ital adolf hitler from mein kampf tran ralph mannheim of course someone bad believe something do not make that belief wrong it also entirely possible that hitler wa lie when he claim to believe in god we certainly ca conclude that he an atheist though subject the bible prove it typical post in the bible it say that response most of the reader of feel that the bible be of questionable accuracy a it wa write thousand of year ago by many author who be record oral tradition that exist many year before thu any claim in it be of questionable legitimacy thi be to say that the bible ha no truth in it simply that any truth must be examine before be accept many of the reader of thi group also feel that because any passage be subject to interpretation any claim that a passage one thing and one thing only be not legitimate note that thi feel tend to extend to other book it be also remarkable to many atheist that theist tend to ignore other equally plausible religiou book in favmy of those of their own religion subject pascal wager typical post if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lose nothing but if you do believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefore it be foolish to be an atheist response thi argument be know a pascal wager it ha several flaw firstly it do not indicate which religion to follow indeed there be many mutually exclusive and contradictory religion out there thi be often describe a the avoid the wrong hell problem if a person be a follower of religion x he may end up in religion y version of hell secondly the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lose nothing be not true suppose you believe in the wrong god the true god might punish you for ymy foolishnes consider also the death that have result from person reject medicine in favmy of prayer another flaw in the argument be that it be base on the assumption that the two possibility be equally likely or at least that they be of comparable likelihood if in fact the possibility of there be a god be close to zero the argument become much le persuasive so sadly the argument be only likely to convince those who believe already also many feel that for intellectually honest person belief be base on evidence with some amount of intuition it be not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysi formally speak the argument consist of fmy statement one do not know whether god exist not believe in god be bad for one eternal soul if god do exist believing in god be of no consequence if god do not exist therefore it be in one interest to believe in god there be two approach to the argument the first be to view a an assumption and a a consequence of it one problem with thi approach in the abstract be that it create information from no information thi be consider invalid in information theory statement indicate one ha no information about god but statement indicate that beneficial information can be gain from the absolute lack of information about god thi violate information entropy information ha be extract from no information at no cost the alternative approach be to claim that and be both assumption the problem with thi be that be then basically an assumption which state the christian position and only a christian will agree with that assumption the argument thu collapse to if you be a christian it be in ymy interest to believe in god a rather vacuou tautology and not the way pascal intend the argument to be view the biggest reason why pascal wager be a failure be that if god be omniscient he will certainly know who really believe and who believe a a wager he will spurn the latter assume he actually care at all whether person believe in him subject what be occam razor typical post person keep talk about occam razor what be it response william of occam formulate a principle which ha become know a occam razor in it original form it say do not multiply entity unnecessarily that be if you can explain something without suppose the existence of some entity then do so nowaday when person refer to occam razor they generally expres it more generally for example a take the simplest solution the relevance to atheism be that we can look at two possible explanation for what we see around u there be an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which come into be a a result of natural process there be an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there be also a god who create the universe clearly thi god must be of non-zero complexity given that both explanation fit the fact occam razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two solution number one unfortunately some argue that there be a third even more simple solution there be an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there we just imagine that there be thi third option lead u logically toward solipsism which many person find unacceptable subject why it good to believe in jesu typical post i want to tell person about the virtue and benefit of my religion response preaching be not appreciate feel free to talk about ymy religion but please do not write post that be on a conversion theme such post do not belong on and will be reject from try the newsgroup you would doubtles not welcome post from atheist to ymy favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto other a you would have them do unto you often theist make their basic claim about god in the form of lengthy analogy or parable be aware that atheist have hear of god and know the basic claim about him if the sole purpose of ymy parable be to tell atheist that god exist and bring salvation you may a well not post it since it tell u nothing we have not be tell before subject why i know that god exist typical post i know from personal experience and prayer that god exist response just a many theist have personal evidence that the be they worship exist so many atheist have personal evidence that such be do not exist that evidence vary from person to person furthermore without wish to dismis ymy evidence out of hand many person have claim all kind of unlikely thing that they have be abduct by ufo visit by the ghost of elvi and so on subject einstein and god do not play dice typical post albert einstein believe in god do you think you cleverer than him response einstein do once comment that god do not play dice with the universe thi quotation be commonly mention to show that einstein believe in the christian god used thi way it be out of context it refer to einstein refusal to accept the uncertainty indicate by quantum theory furthermore einstein religiou background wa jewish rather than christian a better quotation show what einstein think about god be the follow i believe in spinoza god who reveal himself in the orderly harmony of what exist not in a god who concern himself with fate and action of human be einstein wa unable to accept quantum theory because of hi belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random event and which would not be dependent upon the observer he believe that qm wa incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretation so far no such better theory ha be find and much evidence suggest that it never will be a longer quote from einstein appear in science philosophy and religion a symposium publish by the conference on science philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life inc new york in it he say the more a man be imbue with the order regularity of all event the firmer become hi conviction that there be no room leave by the side of thi order regularity for cause of a different nature for him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exist a an independent cause of natural event to be sure the doctrine of a personal god interfere with natural event could never be refute italic hi in the real sense by science for thi doctrine can alway take refuge in those domain in which scientific knowledge ha not yet be able to set foot but i be convince that such behavior on the part of representative of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal for a doctrine which be to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose it effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress in their struggle for the ethical good teacher of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal god that be give up that source of fear and hope which in the past place such vast power in the hand of priest in their labor they will have to avail themself of those force which be capable of cultivate the good the true and the beautiful in humanity itself thi be to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task einstein ha also say it wa of course a lie what you read about my religou conviction a lie which be be systematically repeat i do not believe in a personal god and i have never deny thi but have express it clearly if something be in me which can be call religiou then it be the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far a my science can reveal it the latter quote be from albert einstein the human side edit by helen duka and banesh hoffman and publish by princeton university pres also from the same book i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethic to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it of course the fact that einstein choose not to believe in christianity do not in itself imply that christianity be false subject everyone worship something typical post everyone worship something whether it money power or god response if that be true everyone be a polytheist theist care just a much about those thing that atheist care about if the atheist reaction to for example their family amount to worship then so do the theist subject why there must be a causeles cause typical post set of integer that have a lower bind each have a smallest member so chain of cause must all have a first element a causeles cause response the set of real number greater than zero ha a definite lower bind but ha no smallest member further even if it be true that there must be a causeles cause that do not imply that that cause must be a consciou supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favour by any particular religion subject the universe be so complex it must have be design typical post the presence of design in the universe prove there be a god surely you do think all thi appear here just by chance response thi be know a the argument from design it be a matter of dispute whether there be any element of design in the universe those who believe that the complexity and diversity of live creature on the earth be evidence of a creator be best advise to read the newsgroup for a while there be insufficient space to summarize both side of that debate here however the conclusion be that there be no scientific evidence in favmy of so-called scientific creationism furthermore there be much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexity of the universe and life on earth the origin of the argument by design be a feel that the existence of something a incredibly intricate a say a human be so improbable that surely it ca have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence direct thing so that human come from the chao deliberately but if human intelligence be so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashion an entire universe complete with consciou be must be immeasurably more unlikely the approach use to argue in favmy of the existence of a creator can be turn around and apply to the creationist position thi lead u to the familiar theme of if a creator create the universe what create the creator but with the addition of spiral improbability the only way out be to declare that the creator wa not create and just be or wa from here we might a well ask what be wrong with say that the universe just be without introduce a creator indeed stephen hawking in hi book a brief history of time explain hi theory that the universe be close and finite in extent with no begin or end the argument from design be often state by analogy in the so-called watchmaker argument one be ask to imagine that one ha find a watch on the beach do one assume that it wa create by a watchmaker or that it evolve naturally of course one assume a watchmaker yet like the watch the universe be intricate and complex so the argument go the universe too must have a creator the watchmaker analogy suffer from three particular flaw over and above those common to all argument by design firstly a watchmaker create watch from pre-existing material wherea god be claim to have create the universe from nothing these two sort of creation be clearly fundamentally different and the analogy be therefore rather weak secondly a watchmaker make watch but there be many other thing in the world if we walk further along the beach and find a nuclear reactor we would assume it wa create by the watchmaker the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creator each responsible for a different part of creation finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch be not part of nature because it be order and therefore stand out from the randomnes of nature yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe be obviously not random but show element of order the watchmaker argument be thu internally inconsistent subject independent evidence that the bible be true typical post the event of the new testament be confirm by independent documentary evidence for example response the write of josephu be often mention a independent documentary evidence early version of josephu work be think not to have mention jesu or jame the extant version discus john in a non-christian context many scholar believe that the original mention jesu and jame in pass but that thi wa expand by christian copyist several reconstruction of the original text have be publish to thi effect much information appear in the ecclesiastical history of eusebiu about it be worthles a historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily eusebiu who be generally acknowledge a first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity it be eusebiu who be generally give the title of authorship for thi material aside from the new testament the biographical information about jesu be more well-documented for further information please consult the frequently asked question file for the newsgroup subject godel incompletenes theorem typical post godel incompletenes theorem demonstrate that it be impossible for the bible to be both true and complete response godel first incompletenes theorem say that in any consistent formal system which be sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expression which can never be prove to be valid or invalid or within that formal system technically speak the system must also be recursive that be there must be a decision procedure for determine whether a give string be an axiom within the formal system essentially all such system can formulate what be know a a liar paradox the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english be thi sentence be false note that if a proposition be undecidable the formal system can not even deduce that it be undecidable the logic use in theological discussion be rarely well define so claim that godel incompletenes theorem demonstrate that it be impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god be worthles in isolation one can trivially define a formal system in which it be possible to prove the existence of god simply by have the existence of god state a an axiom thi be unlikely to be view by atheist a a convince proof however it may be possible to succeed in produce a formal system build on axiom that both atheist and theist agree with it may then be possible to show that godel incompletenes theorem hold for that system however that would still not demonstrate that it be impossible to prove that god exist within the system furthermore it certainly would tell u anything about whether it be possible to prove the existence of god generally note also that all of these hypothetical formal system tell u nothing about the actual existence of god the formal system be just abstraction another frequent claim be that godel incompletenes theorem demonstrate that a religiou text the bible the book of mormon or whatever can not be both consistent and universally applicable religiou text be not formal system so such claim be nonsense subject george bush on atheism and patriotism typical post did george bush really say that atheist should not be consider citizen response the follow exchange take place at the chicago airport between robert i sherman of american atheist pres and
