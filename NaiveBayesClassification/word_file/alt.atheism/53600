from mathew mathew subject re gulf war selling arm jbrown write mathew i agree thi it seem be the crux of ymy whole position be it that the u should have support hussein and sell him arm to fight iran i agree and i agree in ruthlessly hunt down those who do or do but we do sell arm to hussein and it a do deal now he invade kuwait so do we just sit back and say well we sell him all those arm i suppose he just want to use them now too bad for kuwait no unfortunately sit back and let thing be be not the way to correct a former mistake destroying hussein military potential a we do wa the right move but i agree with ymy statement reagan and bush make a grave error in judgment to sell arm to hussein but it still happening that the entire point only last month john major hail it a a great victory that he have personally secure a sale of arm to saudi arabium the same month we sell jet fighter to the same indonesian government that busy kill the east timorese it all very well to say oop we make a boo-boo better clean up the mistake but the u and uk keep make the same mistake they do it so often that i ca believe it not deliberate thi suspicion be reinforce by the fact that the mistake be an extremely profitable one for a decrepit economy reliant on arm sale so it really not the gulf war you abhor so much it wa the and the west shortsightednes in sell arm to hussein which ultimately make the war inevitable right no i think both be terrible mathew
