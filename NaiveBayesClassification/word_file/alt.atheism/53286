from kempmp petrus pihko subject re idle question for fellow atheist acooper write i wonder how many atheist out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheist be the majority rather than the minority group of the population i be think about thi every now and then since i cut my ty with christianity it be surprise to note that a large majority of person at least in finland seem to be apatheist even though of the population be member of the lutheran church of finland religiou person be actually a minority could it be possible that many person believe in god just in case it seem person do not want to seek the truth they fall prey to pascal wager or other poor argument a small minority of those who do believe read the bible regularly the majority do care it believe but do know what or how person do usually allow their belief to change their lifestyle they only want to keep the virtual gate open a christian would say that they be not bear in the spirit but thi do not disturb them religion be not something to think about i afraid a society with a true atheist majority be an impossible dream religion have a strong appeal to person nevertheles a promise of life after death be something human eagerly listen to coupled with threat of eternal torture and the idea that my morality be under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop too many person take the poison with a smile or just pretend to swallow and unconsciously hope god would notice also how many atheist out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of think over the theistic way of think the typical selfish argument would be that both line of think evolve from the same inherent motivation so one be not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively but then again a measure stick must be draw somewhere and if we can not assign value to a system of belief at it core than the only other alternative be to apply it to it periphery ie how it express it own selfishnes if logic and reason be value then i would claim that atheistic think be of higher value than the theistic exposition theist make unnecessary assumption they believe in i yet to see good reason to believe in god or to take a leap of faith at all a revelation would do however why do we value logic and reason thi question bear some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science why mathematics work strong deep structuralist like atkin have propose that perhap after all everything be mathematics is usefulnes any criterion petrus petrus pihko kem-pmp mathematics be the truth pihatie c physic be the rule of oulu kempmp the game finland chemistry be the game
