from benedikt rosenau subject re gospel dating in article mangoe charley wingate write assuming you be present it accurately i do see how thi argument really lead to any firm conclusion the material in john i not sure exactly what be refer to here but i take for grant the similarity to the q material is different hence one could have almost any relationship between the two right up to john get it straight from jesu mouth no the argument say john ha know q ie a codify version of the logium and not the original assume that there ha be one it ha weakness of course like that john might have know the original yet rather refer to q in hi text or that the logium be give in a codify version in the first place the argument alone do not allow a firm conclusion but it fit well into the date usually give for the gospel we be talk date of text here not the age of the author the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke do not consider their respective age it say matthew ha read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark the version of the usual theory i have hear ha matthew and luke independently rely on mark and q one would think that if luke rely on matthew we would have the grate inconsistency in the geneology for one thing not necessarily luke may have trust the version he know better than the version give by matthew improving on matthew would give a motive for instance a far a i know the theory that luke ha know matthew be base on a statistical analysi of the text a it be assume that john know the content of luke text the evidence for that be not overwhelm admittedly thi be the part that be particularly new to me if it be possible that you could point me to a reference i be grateful yep but it will take another day or so to get the source i hope ymy german be good enough unfortunately i have get the info at hand it wa i think in the late or early and it wa possibly a old a ce when they be from about why do they shed doubt on the order on put john after the rest of the three because it close up the gap between suppose write and the exist copy quit a bite the further away from the original the more copy can be write and therefore survival become more probable i still do not see how copy from allow to change the date of john that john wa a disciple be not generally accept the style and language together with the theology be usually use a counterargument i not really impress with the theology argument but i really point thi out a an if and a i point out earlier one can not make these argument about i peter i see no reason not to accept it a an authentic letter ye but an if gife only possibility and no evidence the authencity of many letter be still discuss it look a if conclusion about them be not draw because some pet dogma of the church would probably fall with them a well one step and one generation remove be bad even in my time compare that to report of similar event in my century in almost illiterate society the best analogy would be reporter talk to the participant which be not so bad well rather like some newsletter of a political party report from the big meet not necessarily wrong but certainly bad in other word one do not know what the original of mark do look like and argument base on mark be pretty weak but the statement of divinity be not in that section and in any case it agree that the most important epistle predate mark ye but the accuracy of their tradition be another problem question are there letter not from paul and predate mark claim the divinity of jesu benedikt
