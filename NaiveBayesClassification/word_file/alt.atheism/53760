from robert knowle subject re islam and scientific prediction wa date frus apr gmt from umar khan khan hi conclusion wa that while he wa impress that what little the holy have to say about science wa accurate he wa far more impress that the holy do not contain the same rampant error evidence in the tradition how would a man of century arabium have know what not to include in the holy assume he have author it well it look like the folk in have loosen up a bite and be discuss thi topic a well a the topic a few book on the subject have also be mention in addition to the one you mention these may be hard to find but i think i may take a stab at it out of curiosity i know the one film i saw on thi subject wa pretty weak and the only two quote i have see which be use to show science in the koran which i post here be also pretty vague i suspect that these book will extrapolate an awful lot on the quote they have at least one poster on the islam channel seem to have some misgive about the practice of use the koran to decide what be good science i wonder if islam ha ever come up with the equivalent of the christian creation science on any topic it would be interest to find a history of scientific interpretation of the koran to see if anyone use the koran to support earlier science which ha since be discard it be all too easy to look at science a it exist today and then interpret passage to match those find person do similar thing with the say of nostradamu all the time anyway it be a rather unique claim of islam and may be worth check
