from livesey jon livesey subject re morality wa re political atheist in article keith keith allan schneider write livesey jon livesey write explain to me how instinctive act can be moral act and i be happy to listen for example if it be instinctive not to murder then not murder would have no moral significance since there would be nothing voluntary about it see there you go again say that a moral act be only significant if it be voluntary why do you think thi if you force me to do something be i morally responsible for it and anyway human have the ability to disregard some of their instinct well make up ymy mind is it to be instinctive not to murder or not so only intelligent be can be moral even if the bahavior of other be mimic their you be start to get the point mimicry be not necessarily the same a the action be imitate a parrot say pretty polly be necessarily comment on the pulchritude of polly you be attach too many thing to the term moral i think let try thi be it good that animal of the same specie do kill each other or do you think thi be right it not even correct animal of the same specie do kill one another or do you think that animal be machine and that nothing they do be either right nor wrong sigh i wonder how many time we have be round thi loop i think that instinctive bahavimy ha no moral significance i be quite prepare to believe that higher animal such a primate have the begin of a moral sense since they seem to exhibit self-awarenes animal of the same specie could kill each other arbitarily but they do they do i and other poster have give you many example of exactly thi but you seem to have a very short memory those be arbitrary kill they be slay relate to some sort of mat ritual or whatnot so what are you try to say that some kill in animal ha a moral significance and some do not is thi ymy natural morality are you try to say that thi be an act of morality because most animal be intelligent enough to think like we do i say there must be the possibility that the organism it not just person we be talk about can consider alternative it right there in the post you be reply to ye it wa but i still do understand ymy distinction what do you mean by consider can a small child be moral how about a gorilla a dolphin a platypu where be the line draw do the be need to be self aware are you blind what do you think that thi sentence mean there must be the possibility that the organism it not just person we be talk about can consider alternative what would that imply what do you call the mechanism which seem to prevent animal of the same specie from arbitrarily kill each other do you find the fact that they do at all significant i find the fact that they do to be significant jon
