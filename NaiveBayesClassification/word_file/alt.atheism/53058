from schlegel mark schlegel subject re amusing atheist and agnostic timmbake bake timmon write atheism deny the existence of god thi be logically bankrupt where be the proof of thi nonexistence it a joke thi be one of my favorite fallaciou point against atheism the belief that you ca deny anything that you ca prove do exist thi be easily nail by show that an infinite number of be be conceivable but not observe to exist do thi mean that we would have to believe in all of them according to the above poster we must believe in object or be that have be prove not to exist so why stop at god there could be a huge number of be identical to ronald reagan except for trivial difference say one be miss a finger one ha blond hair and they all live on other planet so we ca see them the reason no one but atheist bring thi up be that none of these christian have a vest interest in these unknown be with the exception of god fine but why do these person shoot themself in the foot and mock the idea of a god here again be a classic atheist fallacy how do they shoot themself in the foot radical muslim the crusade the inquisition be common example that atheist like to bring up a mark against religion how weak only fool can take that drivel seriously how about the grand-daddy of all human atrocity the stalinist movement twenty eight million person kill under thi leadership which proudly feature atheism there be a big difference here stalin do say that he stand for a particular moral position against murder and terrorism etc and then do the opposite like the religiou movement he wa at least an honest killer thi be not a support of stalin but an attack on thi viewpoint saying that atheism support murder and violence just because one man wa a tyrant and an atheist be just bad logic look at all the russian that help stalin that be atheist do they contradict ymy point beside ymy point assume that hi atheism wa relevant to hi murder person thi be just the common assumption that atheist ca value life a much a theist which you do support agnostic be not a funny because they be more reasonable yet they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of god be unknowable thi in itself be every bite the assumption that atheism be though it le arrogant and pompou ah and here another point you do get out of the faq an atheist do have to hold the positive view that god do exist may just have the non-existence of the positive belief here the example strong atheism i believe god do not exist a positive belief weak atheism i do believe in a god a negative belief these be not the same some one that ha never think of the idea of god in their whole life be technically an atheist but not the kind that you be call unreasonable or let look at it thi way in set suppose that a give person ha a huge set of idea that i will represent a capital letter and these person then either believe that these idea exist a real object or not so if s santum then e s no be the person not believe in santum but still have the idea of santum but notice that even e s no be itself another idea thi mean you have lot of case christian a e a ye b e b no g e g ye where g god atheist strong a e a g e g no atheist weak a e no g at all in the set agnostic a g e g indeterminate e why be person so afraid to say undecided it must just be another feature of human nature undecided be not a sexy trendy or glamorou word it do not inspire much hate or conflict it not blasphemou it not political in fact it be too often take to mean unsophisticated nietzsche once say that a man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put thi be that humanity alway prefer no or ye to a maybe because indecision be not a useful survival trait evolution ha drill it in u to take position even false one bake timmon iius
