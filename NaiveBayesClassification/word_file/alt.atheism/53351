from timmbake bake timmon subject re amusing atheist and anarchist mccullou write my turn i go back and reread ymy post all you do be attack atheism and say that agnosticism wa a funny a atheism nowhere do that imply that you be agnostic or weak atheist a most person who post such inflammatory remark be theist it wa a reasonable assumption sorry you right i do not clearly state it rule condescending to the population at large theist will not win many person to ymy faith anytime soon it only ruin ymy credibility how be i be condescend to the population at large i be state something that happen to be true for a long time i could believe that person actually believe in thi god idea it wa an alien concept to me i be not try to win person to my faith a you put it i have no faith religion wa a non issue when i have the attitude above because it never even occur to me to believe atheist by default i gues you could say the most common form of condescend be the rational versu irrational attitude once one ha accept the assumption that there be no god s and then consider other faith to be irrational simply because their assumption s contradict ymy assumption then i would say there a lack of consistency here now i know you get on me about faith if the positive belief that god do not exist be a close logical argument why do so many rational person have problem with that logic but you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist sorry for the flamage the line about atheist have something up their sleeve be what seem to imply that sorry be read too much on the clipper project lately and the paranoium over there may have seep in some what be the clipper project btw rule do mix apple with orange how can you say that the extermination by the mongol wa worse than stalin khan conquer person unsympathetic to hi cause that wa atrociou but stalin kill million of hi own person who love and worship him and hi atheist state how can anyone be worse than that many ruler have do similar thing in the past only stalin do it when there wa plenty of documentation to afix the blame on him the evidence be that some of the early european ruler rule with an iron fist much like stalin you throw in number and i be sick of hear about stalin a an example because the example do apply you manage to get me angry with ymy post because it appear to attack all form of atheism it might have appear to attack atheism in general but it point wa that ma kill happen for all sort of reason person will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cro or hammer sickle the stalin example be important not only because it still a widely unappreciated era that person want to forget but also because person really do love him and hi idea even after all that he have work the evidence i be refer to be more a lack of evidence than negative evidence say i claim there be no pink crow i have never see a pink crow but that do mean it could exist but thi person here claim that there be pink crow even though he admit he ha be able to capture one or get a photo or find one with me etc in a sense that be evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crow that be what i be say when i look at the evidence i look at the suppossed evidence for a deity show how it be flaw and do show what theist want it to show and go on first all the pink argument in the world will not sway most person for they simply do not accept the analogy why one of the big reason be that many many person want something beyond thi life you can pretend that they do want thi but i for one can accept it and even want it myself sometime and there be nothing unique in thi example of why person want a god can love a a truth be prove logically themself namely a god or god so in principle it hard to see how theist be necessarily arrogant make no sense to me they seem arrogant to make such a claim to me but my previou refutation still stand and i believe there may be another one on the net john the baptist boast of jesu to many person i find it hard to see how that behavior be arrogant at all many christian i know also boast in thi way but i still do not necessarily see it a arrogance of course i do know arrogant christian doctor and teacher a well technically you might consider the person who originally make a give claim to be arrogant jesu for instance are you talk about all atheism or just strong atheism if you be talk about weak atheism which i believe in then i refuse such a claim atheism be a lack of belief i use good ol occam razor to make the final rejection of a deity in that a i see thing even if i present the hypothesise in an equal fasion i find the theist argument not plausible i speak against strong atheism i also often find that the evidence support a faith be very subjective just a say the evidence support love a truth be subjective i believe i answer that i apologize for the a you state incorrect assumption on ymy theism but i saw nothing to indicate that you be an agnostic only that you be just another newbie christian on the net try to get some cheap shoot in no apology necessary bake timmon iius there
