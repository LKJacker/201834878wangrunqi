from benedikt rosenau subject re gospel dating in article mangoe charley wingate write well john ha a quite different not necessarily more elaborate theology there be some evidence that he must have know luke and that the content of q wa know to him but not in a form thi be a new argument to me could you elaborate a little the argument go a follow q-oid quote appear in john but not in the almost codify way they be in matthew or luke however they be consider to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q a such and not an entirely different source assuming that he know luke would obviously put him after luke and would give evidence for the latter assumption i do think thi follow if you take the most traditional attribution then luke might have know john but john be an elder figure in either case we talk span of time here which be well within the range of lifetime we be talk date of text here not the age of the author the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke do not consider their respective age it say matthew ha read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark a it be assume that john know the content of luke text the evidence for that be not overwhelm admittedly earlier manuscript of john have be discover interesting where and which how be they date how old be they unfortunately i have get the info at hand it wa i think in the late or early and it wa possibly a old a ce when they be from about why do they shed doubt on the order on put john after the rest of the three i do see ymy point it be exactly what jame felder say they have no first hand knowledge of the event and it obviou that at least two of them use older text a the base of their account and even the association of luke to paul or mark to peter be not generally accept well a genuine letter of peter would be close enough would it sure an original together with id card of sender and receiver would be fine so what that suppose to say am i miss something and i do think a one step remove source be that bad if luke and mark and matthew learn their story directly from diciple then i really can not believe in the sort of big transformation from jesu to gospel that some person posit in news report one generally get no better information than thi and if john is a diciple then there nothing more to be say that john wa a disciple be not generally accept the style and language together with the theology be usually use a counterargument the argument that john wa a disciple rely on the claim in the gospel of john itself is there any other evidence for it one step and one generation remove be bad even in my time compare that to report of similar event in my century in almost illiterate society not even to speak off that believer be not necessarily the best source it be also obviou that mark ha be edit how old be the oldest manuscript to my knowledge which can be antiquate the oldest be quite after any of these estimate and it be not even complete the only clear edit be problem of the end and it basically a hopeles me the oldest version give a strong sense of incompletenes to the point where the shortest version seem to break off in midsentence the most obviou solution be that at some point part of the text wa lose the material from verse on be pretty clearly later and seem to represent a synopsy of the end of luke in other word one do not know what the original of mark do look like and argument base on mark be pretty weak but how be that connect to a redating of john benedikt
