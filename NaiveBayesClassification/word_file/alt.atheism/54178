from ray ray fischer subject re after year can we say that christian morality be frank frank write ray ray fischer write frank frank write plu question for you why do get so het up about the idea that relativism be better than objectivism to the degree that relativism be a more accurate decription of the truth than be objectivism it provide more power and ability to control event i think you lose the right to talk about the truth once you say value be relative accuracy be a value judgement too it so happen i agree with the substance of what you say below but it clear to me that at least some value be objective truth be better than falsehood peace be better than war education be better than ignorance we know these thing if we know anything while i agree that these be generally hold to be good thing i question whether they come very close to be objective value especially consider that at one time or another each ha be view a be undesirable i doubt you could even come up with anything that could be say to be universally good or bad and when i refer to the truth i wa use the term hypothetically realize full well that there may not even be such a thing assuming for the moment that moral be relative then two relativist can recognize that neither ha a lock on the absolute truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that produce the desire result no they can not because they acknowledge up front that the desire result do not exist that after all be the mean of compromise plu some problem if the relativist have no value in common compromise be impossible what happen then who if anyone be right what happen if one relativist ha a value never compromise a value plant bomb in crowd shop area after all if moral be relative these value can not meaningfully be say to be incorrect true enough but they can not be say to be anything more than personal moral one thing notably lack in most extremist be any sense of personal accountability the justification for any socially unacceptable behavimy be invariably some higher authority aka absolute moral truth assuming that there be an absolute morality two disagree objectivist can either be both wrong or just one of them right there be no room for compromise once you beleive in absolute moral you must accept that you be amoral or that everyone who disagree with you be amoral untrue one can accept that one do not know the whole truth part of the objective truth about morality may well be that flexibility be better than rigidity compromise be better than believe you have a lock on moral etc in the same way i can believe in an objective reality without claim to know the mechanism for quantum collapse or who shoot jfk an objective truth that say one can not know the objective truth interesting notion certainly one can have a one moral a belief that compromise be good but to compromise on the absolute truth be not something most person do very successfully i suppose one could hold compromise a be an absolute moral but then what happen when someone else insist on no compromise how do you compromise on compromise given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endles contention i say that compromise seem to be better and i would agree but it bloody to pointles to speak of it if it merely a matter of taste is ymy like for peace any better found than someone else like for ice-cream i look for a way to say ye to that question and relativism be it almost invariably when consider the relative value of one thing over another be it moral or consequence person only consider those aspect which justify a desire action or belief in justify a commitement to peace i might argue that it let person live long healthy and peaceful life while that much may well be true it be incomplete in ignore the benefit of war kill off the most agressive member of society trim down the population stimulate production the equation be alway more complex than present to characterize relative moral a merely follow one own conscience desire be to unduly simplify it ray fischer conviction be more dangerou enemy of truth ray than ly friedrich nietzsche
