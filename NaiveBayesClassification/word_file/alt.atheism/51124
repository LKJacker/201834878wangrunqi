from benedikt rosenau subject re an anecdote about islam in article jaeger gregg jaeger write when they be victimize they be muslim when they victimize other they be not true muslim tm or no muslim at all quite annoy i do understand the point of thi petty sarcasm it be a basic principle of islam that if one be bear muslim or one say i testify that there be no god but god and mohammad be a prophet of god that so long a one do not explicitly reject islam by word then one must be consider muslim by all muslim so the phenomenon you attempt to make into a general rule or psychology be a direct odd with basic islamic principle if you want to attack islam you could do better than than to argue against something that islam explicitly contradict it wa no criticism of islam for a change it wa a criticism of the argument use namely whenever person you identify a muslim be the victim of the attack of other they be use an argument for the bad situation of muslim but whenever deed by muslim that victimize other be name they do not count a an argument because what these person do wa not do a a true muslim no mention be make how muslim be the cause of a bad situation of another party double standard benedikt
