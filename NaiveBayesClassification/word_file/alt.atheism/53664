from kempmp petrus pihko subject re atheism survey i reply to thi query vium e-mail but i think there be some issue that be worth discuss in public mtum mtabbott write i be do research on atheism part of which involf field research here on the net the follow be a survey direct toward all reader of thi group intend to get datum about the basi of atheistic belief i would recommend you to take a look at ymy dictionary faq file to notice that atheism be not a belief system and what be common to all atheist be not a belief but a lack of belief in deity i can not imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without pay careful attention to thi issue first of all i try to structure question that can be answer in a variety of way with vary amount of detail it possible to give succinct answer to most everything but there enough here to keep most of you type for hour i sure imho thi be a poor method to do any real survey although i sure the reply might keep you amuse for hour also i tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzword like belief system although i know some of you might contend that you do have any belief but be skeptical toward everything i understand but you know what i mean think of such buzzword a abbreviation for the rather unweildy phrase require to get the precise idea acros no i do not know what you mean if you be survey my individual philosophy fine but that not strictly atheism atheism be not just another godles version of the theistic explanation for life the universe and everything it be not a belief system and it could hardly be call a philosophical system once more atheism be characterise by lack of belief in deity do not twist the mean or assume that we have some kind of philosophy we all agree on some comment on ymy question what contact with other atheist have you have before and after and during ymy conversion to atheism certainly ymy involvement with count how have net discussion affect ymy belief i would also like to hear more about thi have we be able to anyone are you convince that ymy belief be acquire through wholly rational mean proof of the non-existence of god etc or wa it perhap at least in part through other mean alienation from mainstream religion etc thi question contain a contradiction in term belief can not be acquire rationally if they could they would not be belief you also seem to have rather strange idea of how person become atheist those who be alienate from religion do not necessarily become atheist they just think very little about religion it seem it require a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that religion be actually intellectually dishonest virtual reality those who have never have belief will certainly find thi question quite odd how can lack of belief be acquire when do i acquire lack of belief in the easter bunny i do believe in santum though to what extent do you feel you understand the universe through ymy belief what phenomenon of the universe and of human existence anything from physical phenomenon to the problem of the existence of evil in human affair do you feel be adequately deal with by ymy belief and where be they lack a an explanatory method thi question do not make any sense since atheism do not deal with these issue it be not a worldview or a philosophy or a belief system sigh why have i see a good well-thought survey in the usenet for three year and what be the point of do survey in the net anyway just to abstract some opinion petrus petrus pihko kem-pmp mathematics be the truth pihatie c physic be the rule of oulu kempmp the game finland chemistry be the game
