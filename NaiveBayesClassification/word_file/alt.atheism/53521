from cbrasted charle brasted subject re some think bissda dan lawrence bissell write first i want to start right out and say that i a christian it make sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo book liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he write the book anyway he wa part of an effort to destroy christianity in the proces he become a christian himself i assume you be post to encourage comment how much history ha tony campello read not much it seem the arguement he use i be sum up the book be about whether jesu wa god or not i know many of you do believe but listen to a different perspective for we all have something to gain by listen to what other have to say it be good to hear that there be a few reasonable christian about if only those christian scientist would take note in australium there be a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientist who believe that every single event in the bible be exactly true and that there be a rational explanation for it all that can be justify by use the law of physic for example there be a few chap who be try to prove that the age of the universe be year old and that the error in conventional calculation be the result of the fact that the speed light ha be rapidly decay over the year and thi ha not be account for the book say that jesu wa either a liar or he wa crazy a modern day koresh or he wa actually who he say he wa or of course that he never exist and the bible wa a story and wa never intend to become a manifesto for a billion person did tony follow that one up some reason why he would be a liar be a follow who would die for a lie would person be able to tell if he wa a liar person gather around him and keep do it many gather from hear or see someone who wa or have be heal million of person have die for a lie thi point be difficult to substantiate since it be not well define a great many religiou argument work in that way but consider the many aztec warrior who sacrifice themself to their god in the belief that thi act would bring them victory of the spanish invader the list be endles the aztec lose btw call me a fool but i believe he do heal person that be perfectly reasonable but it be not grind for me or anyone to become a christian more to the point it do not add weight to the claim that jesu wa the real thing niether wa he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be draw to someone who wa crazy very doubtful in fact rediculou for example anyone who be draw to david koresh be obviously a fool logical person see thi right away have you ever see a documentary about the rise of nazi germany more to the point do tony mention thi one could hardly call werner heisenberg and hi many colleague fool or illogical man their support of hitler wa base i presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with hi principle obviously my argument be invalid if tony think that hitler wa sane therefore since he wa a liar or a lunatic he must have be the real thing hmmm i do think hi argument warrant the use of a therefore some other thing to note he fulfil load of prophecy in the psalm isaiah and elsewhere in hr alone thi in hi betrayal and crucifixion i do have my bible with me at thi moment next time i write i will use it thi be unfortunately what alot of religiou discussion i have have with person result in quote the bible the only reasonable way i think person can look at the bible be to treat the story a some sort of metaphorical representation of the message that the author be try to present if someone try to interpret part of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sort of shit tony argument would be perfectly reasonable for person who believe the event describe in the bible take place but to convince someone who think the bible be total fiction that jesu be real by quote the book be totally pointles for example in mathematics you can not say a be equal to b because a be equal to b i do think most person understand what a christian be that would possibly explain why there have so many person be kill in religiou war and why there be hundred of different version all claim to be correct it be certainly not what i see a lot in church rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god sake he love u enough to die and save u so we should do the same hey we ca do it god himself inspire u to turn my life over to him that tuff and most person do want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lift or guitar play drum whatever it take time we do rush it in one day christianity be ymy whole life it be not go to church once a week or help poor person once in a while we box everything into time unit such a work at thi time sport tv social life god be above these box and should be carry with u into all these box that we have create for ourself i think if you post thi part to you would get more flame than here i have never really understand why the emotional sentiment of a stranger should be of interest to other person someone famou say that there two evil in life polititian and church one rule by fear of the live the other by fear of the dead if i be press i could probably find the exact quotation cheer charle
