from bil bill conner subject re free moral agency andrew newell write i think you let atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of webster myth a traditional or legendary story a belief whose truth be accept uncritically how do that qualify indeed it almost oxymoronic a rather amuse instance i find that most atheist hold almost no atheist-view a accept uncritically especially the few that be legend many be try to explain basic truth a myth do but they do meet the other criterion andrew the myth to which i refer be the convolute counterfeit athiest have create to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion include christainity in a rational manner and debate it claim a the be state atheist concoct outrageou parody and then hold the religiou accountable for belief they do have what be more accurately oxymoric be the a term like reasonable atheist bill divine justice according to the most fundamental doctrine of christianity when the first man sin he wa at that time the you accuse him of reference mythology then you procede to launch ymy own xtian mythology thi time meet all the requirement of myth here a good example of of what i say above read the post again i say acoording to which mean i be refer to christian doctrine a i understand it if i be speak for myself you know it my purpose in post wa to present a basic overview of christain doctrine since it seem germane bill with those who pretend not to know what be be say and what it mean when atheist claim that they do not know if god exist and do know what he want they contradict the bible which clearly say that everyone know the authority of the bible be it claim to be should i repeat what i write above for the sake of get it acros you may trust the bible but ymy trust it do make it any more credible to me if the bible say that everyone know that clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone know ymy allege god allege existance again i be paraphrase christian doctrine which be very clear on thi point ymy dispute be not with me bill refute while the species-wide condemnation be justify those that claim that there be no evidence for the existence of god or that hi will be unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself be no excuse no they do have to ignore the bible the bible be far from universally accept the bible be not a proof of god it be only a proof that some person have think that there wa a god or do it prove even that they might have be write it a series of fiction short-story a in the case of dionetic assuming the writer believe it the only thing it could possibly prove be that they believe it and that ignore the problem of whether or not all the interpretation and biblical-philosopher be correct there be person who have truly never hear of the bible again read the faq here again you mi the point the bible itself be not the point it what it contain it make no difference who accpet the bible or even who unaware of it existence christian hold that it apply universally because mankind share the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of god see above if you read my post with same care a read the faq we would be have thi conversation bill freedom you be free to ignore god in the same way you be free to ignore gravity and the consequence be inevitable and well know in both case that an atheist ca accept the evidence mean only bzzt wrong answer gravity be directly there it do stop exert a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it god on the other hand do generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloid god do exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity be obviou god be a i say the evidence be there you just do accept it here at least we agree bill secondly human reason be very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it be in itself intrinsic to my nature human reason alway come back to the question of god in every generation and in no human reason ha alway come back to the existance of god it ha usually come back to the existance of god in other word it do generally come back to the xtian god it come back to whether there be any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally do pop up a the idea of a god so much a the question of what natural force be and which one be out there from a world-wide view human nature just make u wonder how the universe come to be what force s be currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in god only exist in religiou wishful think ye human reason do alway come back to the existence of god we have thi discussion be we not bill i say all thi to make the point that christianity be eminently reasonable that divine justice be just and human nature be much different than what atheist think it be whether you agree or not you certainly be not correct on human nature you be at the least base ymy view on a completely eurocentric approach try look at the outside world a well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity well thi be interest truth be to be determine by it politically correct content granted it extremely unhip to be a wasp male and anything european be contemptable but i think thi kind of dialogue the purpose of wa to get at the truth of thing but then i remember the oxymoron reasonalble atheist and i understand bill
