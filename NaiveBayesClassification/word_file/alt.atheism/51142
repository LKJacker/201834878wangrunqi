from keith keith allan schneider subject re political atheist livesey jon livesey write much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself thi be probably the wrong group for it the only relevance here be that you do seem to be able to tell u what capital punishment actually be and when it be murder that be when you tell u murder be wrong you be use a term you have not yet define well i say that when an innocent person ha be execute thi be objectively a murder however who be at blame be another question it seem that the entire society that sanction any sort of execution realize the risk be to blame there be a probability of kill an innocent person by shoot at random into the air and there be a probability of kill an innocent person when the state administer a system of capital punishment so when you do either you know that they action you be take will sooner or later result in the kill of an innocent person ye but there be also a probablity that you will kill someone do any raondom activity presumably you have not isolate yourself totally from the rest of society because of thi and drive will kill person a will airline but person continue to do both driving and fly be not punishment inflict on unwilling prisoner by court they be risk that we take upon ourself willingly and i argue that my law system be a similar risk perhap an innocent person will be punish someday but we work to prevent thi in fact many criminal go free a a result of my try to prevent punishment of innocent if my own drive kill someone else then sure there be a moral issue i know at least one person who wa involve in a fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterward but such accident be to be totally expect give the numner of vehical on the road again the blame be on society no i not thi be what you say you be say that if there be such a false witnes that result in an innocent person be convict and kill it would still be the fault of the state since it do the actual kill no i just comment that the state do the kill it do not depend on there be false witness how could it the state do the kill even in the case of sincere mistake ye but the state be not at fault in such a case the state can only do so much to prevent false witness it be possible so what be you try to say that capital punishment be alway murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidate the system i say capital punishment be murder period not because of thi that and the other but because it involf take human life that my definition of murder i make no appeal to dictionary or to objective moral okay so thi be what you call murder but the question be whether or not all such murder be wrong are you say that all take of human life be wrong no matter what the circumstance if we a a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and list my reason for do so and live with the moral consequence we should not play word game and pretend that murder be murder and that my opinion about how society ought to be run but thi be basically how it work society accept the risk that an innocent person will be murder by execution and every member of society share thi blame and most person definition of murder include some sort of maliciou intent which be not involve in an execution be it but we be try to discus an objective moral system or at least it possibilty what ramification do ymy personal system have on an objective one no we be not discuss an objective moral system i wa show you that you do have one because for one thing you be incapable of define the term in it for example murder murder violate the golden rule execution do not because by allow it at all society implicitly accept the consequence no matter who the innocent victim be we not talk about read mind we be just talk about know the truth ye we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court system work on a principle of know the truth beyond a reasonable doubt sorry but you simply be not quote yourself accurately here be what you say and since we be look totally objectively at thi case then we know what person be think when they be vote to execute the person or not if the intent be maliciou and unfair then the execution would be murder what you be do now be to slide into another claim which be quite different the jury be persuade beyond a seriou doubt be not the same a u know what be in their mind beyond a seriou doubt reading the mind of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction wa moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truth matter and the jury system be one method to approximate such a truth that be twelve member must be convince of a truth moreover a jury which come from a sufficiently prejudice background may allow itself to be persuade beyond a seriou doubt on evidence that you and i would laugh at but then if we read the mind of these person we would know that the conviction wa unfair but would it be perfectly fair if we could read mind if we assume that it would be fair if we know the absolute truth why be it so much le fair in ymy opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth it not a question of fairnes ymy claim which i have quote above be a claim about whether we can know it wa fair so a to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder ye while we could objectively determine the difference if we know all possible information we ca alway determine the difference in my flaw system i think that my system be almost a good a possible but it still be objectively perfect you see it do matter if we know it be fair or not objectively it be either fair or it be not now there a huge difference if we can read mind we can know and if we can not read mind we can know nothing the difference be not in degree of fairnes but in what we can know but what we know ha no effect on an objective system i think it be possible to produce a fairly objective system if we be clear on which goal it be suppose to promote i not go to waste my time try to devise a system that i be pretty sure do not exist why be you so sure i simply want person to confront reality my reality remember why be ymy reality important in thi case the reality be that ideal theory apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairnes of the justice system for every innocent person release from death row there may have be a dozen innocent person execute or a hundred or none at all we simply do know but we can assume that the system be fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctnes of my system say nothing about a totally ideal and objective system now what be we go to do on the one hand we can pretend that we have an theory and that we can know thing we can never know and the justie system be fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain type of kill not murder and go on my way well we can have an ideal system but the work system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that be a close an approximation to the ideal system a possible on the other hand we can recognize that all justice ha a small we hope probability of punish the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequence of the system we set up and then say well here we go murder again maybe some of u will even say gee i wonder if all thi be strictly necessary ye we all bear the responsibility most person seem will to do thi i think that the second be preferable in that if require person to face the moral consequence of what we do a a society instead of shelter ourself from them by magic ceremoney and word game we must realize the consequence of all my action why do you keep separate the justice system from the pack and lest i forget i also do think we have an objective moral system and i believe i only have to take that idea seriously when someone present evidence of it i do think my country ha an objective system but i think such an objective system can exist in theory without omniscience an objective system be not possible in practice keith
