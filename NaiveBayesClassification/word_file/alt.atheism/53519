from bobbe robert beauchaine subject nostalgium the recent rise of nostalgium in thi group combine with the incredible level of utter bullshit ha prompt me to comb through my archive and pull out some of the best of for ymy read pleasure i post a couple of these a day unles group concensu demand that i stop or i run out of good material i have be particularly careful in the past about save attribution i think the follow come from john a johnson but someone correct me if i wrong thi be probably the longest of my entire collection so that the prophecy be fulfilled in consider the christian religion and judge it accord to it claim it be important to look at it claim at fulfil earlier jewish prophecy the scribe matthew be perhap the most eager to draw out what he think be prophetic answer in the career of jesu of nazareth a you will see matthew main strategy be to take variou old testament passage often not even about the promise messiah and apply them to the circumstance in the new testament we must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the account since the gospel be write at least year after jesu wa execute we do not know how much happen exactly a state but for purpose of analysi we will take particular claim at face value immanuel we begin of course at the begin mt mary will bear a son and you joseph will name him which mean g be salvation for he will save hi person from their sin all thi happen to fulfil what the lord have speak by a prophet isaiah in the day of ahaz c bce king of judah rezin of syrium and pekah of israel make war on jerusalem capitol of judah but could not quite conquer it when the house of david ahaz and hi court in judah be tell of thi it heart and the heart of it person shake and the lord g say to isaiah go to meet with ahaz and the lord speak to ahaz through prophet isaiah naturally say ask a sign of g ymy lord it can be a deep a sheol or a high a heaven but ahaz say i wo ask i will not put the lord to a test then isaiah say hear then o house of david is it not enough for you to weary man that you must weary my god too therefore the lord himself will give you a sign behold a young woman be with child and will bear a son and name him immanuel which mean g be with u he will eat curd and honey when he know how to refuse evil and choose good for before the child know how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two king you dread will have be desert matthew home in on just the sentence that be in italic further he the hebrew word almah young woman a specifically virgin but thi be not a prophecy about the messiah it be not a prophecy about an event to happen year later it be not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother in short it not about jesu matthew ha make use of a verse out of context and try to make it fit the specific case of mary it should be note that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be make to fit mary mary virgin or not wa indeed a young woman with child of course the fit be shady and ha problem jesu while think of by later christian to be g walk among man wa never call by the name immanuel if christianity wish to claim thi prophecy for jesu it become at best a cut-and-paste prophecy a second clas prophecy not too convince egypt after jesu birth in bethlehem matthew tell about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to egypt a if he wish to liken jesu to mosis thi wa do to escape an allege infanticidal rampage of the king herod mt and remain there until the death of herod thi wa to fulfil what the lord have speak out of egypt i have cal-led my son what the lord really say wa thi hosea when israel wa a child i love him and out of egypt i call my son the more i call them my person the more they go from me they keep sacrifice to the and keep burn incense to idol matthew conveniently omit the rest of hosea oracle but it wa indeed israel that once call out of egypt want to return thi be history jesu be certainly not be speak of here and if we be to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a jesu that flee and resist g again thi prophecy be just not a convince a matthew probably have hop rachel weep while jesu be off vacation in egypt matthew say that king herod seek to kill him and thu order the execution of all young male child matthew then write mt by thi that which wa speak by the prophet jeremiah wa fulfil a voice wa hear in ramah wail and loud lamentation rachel weep for her child she refuse to be console because they be no more the reference be to a passage in jeremiah refer to the carry off of israel into exile by sargon of assyrium in bce rachel the ancestor of the major tribe of israel ephraim and manasseh be say to weep for her descendant who be no more it be metaphorical of course since rachel live and dy before the hebrew be even in the egyptian exile it be interest to note that it wa leah not rachel who wa the ancestor of the judean the land where jesu and bethlehem be if anyone should do weep for her child it be leah the only connexion that rachel ha with bethlehem be that the legend have it that she wa bury north of the city on the way to ephrath bethlehem a for herod and hi infanticide it be rather unlikely that such an event actually occur one never know but the event be not mention or allude to anywhere else in the bible nor be it mention in any of the secular record of the time herod wa particularly unliked in hi reign and many far le evil deed of herod be carefully record thi might be a prime example of how event be add to jesu life to enhance the message of the church gospel because of the whole story similarity to the tale of the infant mosis in egypt it be highly likely that it be a device set up by matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of jesu it be not surprise that matthew conveniently neglect to mention the rest of the jeremiah quote the child the prophet speak of be not dead but exile in the assyrian empire g comfort the weep rachel say that the child will be return he will gather them back together of course thi would not suit matthew purpose a the child he speak of be dead for good again the prophecy matthew set up be not even that and to anyone who bother to check it out be not too convince the nazarene we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another matthean prophecy after leave egypt joseph wife take the infant jesu to live in the city of nazareth mt that what wa speak of by the prophet might be fulfil he shall be call a nazarene first thing we notice be that matthew do not mention the name of the prophet s thi time second we have to ask who he be there be no messianic prophecy speak of a nazarene worse there be no prophecy period mention a nazarene still worse there be no nazarene mention in the old testament at all in the book of judge an angel tell samson mother that she will judge conceive and bear a son no razor shall tough hi head for he will be a nazirite to hi god from the day of hi birth he will deliver israel from the hand of the philistine thi be of course not a prophecy of jesu or the messiah of g but it be the best that can be find obviously matthew ha begin to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecy in that he be simple make them up now bearing my disease jesu next go around heal person of physical illness and disability mt thi wa to fulfil what wa speak by the prophet isaiah he take my infirmity and bore my disease a expect the verse quote in isaiah be quote out of context and a few word be skew to fit the christian scheme we have is surely he the suffer servant ha bear my sicknes and carry my pain from a read of the surround passage in isaiah we know that the prophet be speak in present tense of the collective nation of israel jehovah choose servant and person he speak to the israelite suffer in exile in the voice of the gentile nation that look upon it thi image be deeply ingrain in jewish identity an image of a chastise yet cherish israel a the instrument of the nation salvation by g the verse speak of israel take on the sickness which be the literal and metaphorical manifestation of guilt and discipline they do not speak of a servant go around and heal person notice that the servant in isaiah take on the sickness and pain of the nation and individual jew jesu a we all know do not take the disease onto himself the verse here in isaiah be not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that have already happen while it be believe that jesu take on the eternal punishment of hell he do not bear the illness he heal so while someone might want to say that figuratively jesu reenact the deed of israel in hi spiritual atonement he ha to admit that matthew parallel miss where he intend it to have it effect silent messiah upon heal multitude of commoner it be say that jesu order them to keep quiet presumable so that he would arouse the attention of the local ruler mt thi wa to fulfill what wa speak by the prophet isaiah behold my servant whom i have choose my beloved with whom my soul be please i will put my spirit on him and he will announce justice to the gentile he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear hi voice in the street he will not break a bruise reed or quench a smolder wick until he bring justice to victory and the gentile will hope in hi name the isaiah passage quote read is behold my servant whom i uphold my choose in whom my soul delight i have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the nation we will not cry or lift up hi voice or make it hear in the street he will not break a bruise reed or quench a smolder wick he will faithfully bring forth justice he will not fail burn dimly or be discourage bruise until he ha establish justice in the earth and the coastland await hi law you see matthew ha conveniently leave out part of the passage because it do not suit the deal of jesu christian could never think of jesu fail never would the light of mankind burn dimly but the servant nation of israel will indeed come to an end when it job be do when the gentile come to embrace g there will no longer be a choose person but rather all will be the child of g also the end phrase ha be change from the judaic the coastland await hi law to the christologic the gentile will hope in hi name while the original proclaim the torah law of jehovah the other rewrite it to fit it strange doctrine of believe in the name if one ha any doubt the servant refer to be not jesu one ha only to read the whole chapter isaiah and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a person rob and plunder so we see that when matthew attempt at prophecy be examine it crumble three day and three night now we come upon a prophecy supposedly utter by the very mouth of the god jesu himself he speak of hi crucifixion and resurrection mt for a jonah wa in the belly of the whale for three day and three night so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth three day and three night before any further discussion can occur it be necessary to know how the jew understand day a far a day name go each wa hour long last from sunset to the follow sunset what wa refer to a a day wa the period of light from to the end sunset at thu accord to my time scale a sabbath day begin at friday even and last until saturday even thi be why the jew celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of saturday instead of sunday it seem like a real miracle that christian do forget that saturday wa indeed the seventh and last day of the week thu when day and night be refer to together hmy daylight portion and hmy night period be be speak of thu jesu say that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three day and three night a the good book tell u jesu wa crucify on the ninth hmy which be friday afternoon he then wa put into the grave sometime after that then jesu leave the grave rise before dawn of what we call sunday the dawn after the sabbath wa over what thi mean be that jesu wa use my time for clarity in the grave from friday night to some time before sunday morning we could also add a little time before friday since the bible be not specific here what thi mean use jewish time be that he wa in the grave for one day two night and possibly a couple of hour of one day certainly thi be a problem for jesu prediction there be absolutely no way we be even able to have hi death involve three day and three night even use modern time measurement we then be lead to suspect that thi error be another one of matthew little mistake and that the gospel writer put false word into hi god mouth and no matter who make the prediction it be more than unconvincing it be counter-convincing hearing understanding jesu tool on a habit of speak to hi vast audience in parable story in which a deeper mean could be find if you be already one of the elect those choose to understand the message of jesu he reason that those who can understand the parable be the one he want if the person can not understand them there be no need to bother with them since they will not accept the plain message any better matthew say mt with them the audience indeed in fulfil the prophecy of isaiah which say you will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive because thi person heart ha grow dull their ear be heavy of hear and they have shut their eye so the they would not perceive with them her with their ear and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them the original isaiah passage be part of hi earlier work hi call to the ministry thi be in bce when israel be flourish right before it fall under the authority of assyrium isaiah see the good time end and also a vision from g call him to bring reform to israel and judah is and g say go and say to thi person hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceive make the heart of thi person fat make their ear heavy and shut their eye so they will not see with their eye or hear with their ear and understand with their heart and turn and be heal then isaiah say how long lord and he say until the city lie waste without inhabitant and house without man and the land be utterly desolate and the take man far away and forsake place be many in the land and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burn again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stand when the tree be fell the holy seed be it stump here we see that it be really g who cause the person of israel to stop listen to the prophet warn but reaffirm the promise make to solomon and david if you read the rest of isaiah you find that thi be do to fulfil the plan of g to use israel a a servant a light to the nation look at isaiah we see that matthew ha cut-and-pasted just a little portion of isaiah verse to suit hi own gospel need more than that he ha alter the word to make it fit the person who do understand jesu story and a we see isaiah verse be not prophecy but rather command from g to him in the present once again matthew prophecy fall flat on it face matthew try again to make jesu parable look like they have the prophetic approval mt he say nothing to them without a parable thi wa to fulfil what wa speak of by the prophet i will open my mouth to them in parable i will utter that which ha be hide since the foundation of the world matthew really botch up here he attempt to quote not from a prophet but from the psalm ps i will open my mouth in parable i will utter dark say of old thing that we all have hear and know thing that my father have tell u we will not hide them from their child but tell to the come generation the gloriou deed of the lord a wa point out the verse in the psalm do not really come from a prophet you might also want to know that earlier copy of matthew gospel even insert isaiah name a thi prophet apparently later scribe catch the error and try to cover some of it up perhap the most significant part of thi be that once again matthew ha alter the old testament scripture a jesu ha say earlier he speak in parable so that some will not understand them the parable in the psalm be not to be hide further they speak of thing know that my father have tell u jesu deal with thing hide since the foundation of the world indeed jesu deal in a lot of secrecy and confusion thi be in direct opposition to the parable in the psalm no wonder matthew have to rewrite them and still once again matthew artificial prophecy fall flat on their face but christian rarely look at thi matthew prophecy be the only thing about christianity that be begin to look bad excuse of little faith in mt we see that the disciple be able to go around cast out demon except in one case not know what epilepsy wa the person think those with the disease be possesed with demon it be no wonder that the disciple be unable to disposses the epileptic but jesu perhap no more enlighten than they be report to have rebuke them say they do have enough faith thi seem strange why wa thi demon special it seem that either a true believer ha faith or he do not apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountain of course you will find no one these day that can move real mountain no one part sea the only miracle the charismatic can speak of be those rumour to happen on trip to mexico or some faraway place major miracle be make some old woman arthritis feel better on sunday morning and the god include jesu be alway shroud in ancient lore and write protect from the skeptic in their sacred past they be either dead sleep or hide in heaven with person rumour about their imminent return and their great miracle of day long go yet life go on tale of mystic story of miracle all in a distant time or a distant place god use to reveal themself to man in the old day jehovah too but now they be silent all the theologian give be variou excuse a to why we do get to see god anymore we too lazy we not zealou enough we sinful it just hi plan we put too many of my own demand on appearance if we have the right faith if we be will to meet g on hi term yet even the most piou of man have not see g you dear reader have not see g not literally you know that to be true i know that presumptuou and bold but search ymy heart you know what i mean all that we see religion do be make person feel good and content about not see g they say my little faith do not merit u to see g sometime they say see the love in these person you worship with see the life of person change that be see g thu person get lull to sleep satisfy with turn g into the everyday sight but that be not see g a i be speak of it be not see g the way person use to see what we see in the world that be good be the compassion of human heart the love give and take by man and woman the forgivenes practise by christian atheist alike beauty create by the mind of man these be the thing that be do these be what we see but it be say thi be so only because everybody ha little faith jesu ride on an as shortly after accept the role of the jewish messiah king jesu request a donkey be bring in for him to ride into jerusalem mt thi take place to fulfil what wa speak by the prophet say tell the daughter of zion behold ymy king be come to you humble mount on an a and on a ass-colt of course the passage quote from zechariah read a little differently lo ymy king come to you he be triumphant and victoriou humble and rid on an a on an a colt he will command peace to the nation there be all that much difference here except that zechariah only involf one animal an ass-colt while matthew read the poetic word slightly differently thu he ha jesu call for both a colt and an adult a from matthew version we get a comical picture of the divine christ sweat it to straddle two donkey thi could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma we find that in the account write earlier by st mark only the colt wa call for and bring to jesu thi indeed fit the verse of zechariah properly and show u that in matthew attempt to use prophetic verse he ha bungle now exclude many respectable christian i have meet i have notice that while christ be think to have ride on as the situation be often reverse nowaday then enter the jerusalem temple the priest be anger at person and youngster call jesu the messiah but jesu reply a we might expect matthew to have do mt have you read out of the mouth of babe and suckle thou ha bring perfect praise it be more likely that matthew make thi response up since jesu wa never one to point out such little prophetic thing and since a we might expect the quote be in error which seem to fit matthew track record quite well we might ask jesu or matthew have you read for the source read psalm o yahweh my lord how majestic be ymy name in the whole world you whose glory be chant above the heaven by babe and infant you have found a bulwark against ymy fo to still the enemy and the avenger the passage hardly need comment there be no perfect praise speak of in the psalm and what praise be there be give to g not hi messiah king and not jesu a mention it seem to be just one more case of matthew pen make up convenient prophetic scripture yhvh say to my lord jesu be say to have ask from whom the promise jewish messiah-king be to be descend the jew agree it be king david but then jesu counter by quote psalm the lord say to my lord sit at my right hand until i put ymy enemy under ymy foot taken at face value jesu be deny the necessity of davidic descent one assume he be in opposition to their answer of course the christian answer be that he agree but be try to make some hide point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king it tempt to believe thi if one be a christian and not interest in matter of investigation but there be problem in jesu time the psalm wa think to be about the messiah and it be easy to see why david might refer to the messiah a hi superior we need only look at the scripture about the messiah to see that he be expect to be a great king bring the jew to time even better than those under david rule of course the jew listen have no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such a the christian worship the problem ly in the mean of thi psalm an error that apparently several jew of jesu time have also make one must remember that there be variou faction among the jew often a a result of different expectation of the messiah-king jesu wa apparently one of these adventist like hi audience who think the messiah advent wa imminent and who interpret psalm among other a be messianic what be the problem then psalm literally read yhvh utterance to my lord sit at my right hand until i make ymy enemy ymy footstool yhvh send forth ymy mighty scepter from zion rule in the midst of ymy fo ymy person will offer themself freely on the day you lead ymy host on the holy mountain you be a priest of the order of melchizedek forever the word lord be often mistakenly capitalise by christian bible to denote divinity in thi lord but in the hebrew the word be adoni and no capitalisation exist adoni simply mean lord a generic term a we would use it it be use often in the scripture to refer to king and to g it be merely an addres of respect there be nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refer either to divinity or to the messiah-king that thi be suppose to be write by david be not certain the title of the psalm translate to either a psalm of david or a psalm about david it seem fit to assume it to be write by a court poet about david covenant and endorsement from g if the psalm have be write by david it be unlikely that he would be talk about the messiah the idea of a perfect king descend from david wa not present in david age we have extensive tale of david do and say none of which include any praise of a messiah many of the psalm show evidence of be write long after david wa dead in time of the exile when g have put hi show of favmy for david kingdom on hold the description in the psalm fit david very well david wa promise by g a rise to power victory over hi enemy successful judgement among the nation he conquer he achieve the priesthood common to melchizedek in be a righteou king enable to bles the person it all fit we do not have to blame thi problem on matthew alone though here there be not artificial prophecy allude to though hi use of the scripture be rather questionable still thi event be common to the other gospel too so we let matthew off a little more easily thi time it be interest to note though how matthew dress up the event the earlier gospel of mark tell the tale with jesu simply speak to a crowd matthew ha the pharisee who become the religiou competition of an infant christianity be the target of jesu question a we might expect matthew write that the event end up by embarrass the pharisee such power be the pen mosis jesu had it together all along we leave the gospel story of matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in john gospel the gospel story of john deserve special treatment because it seem to be so far remove from the real event of jesu career a tell by even matthew but for the moment we will just look at one verse the early church leader found a religion on the jewish hope of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promise make by g when construct the history of abraham mosis write of a promise of land and nationhood to the jewish person while thi wa accomplish eventually under the rule of king david the christian who come along later decide that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise but to do so they expand on the promise preach about a heavenly kingdom john speak ymy father abraham rejoice to see my day he say it and wa glad it would be nice to tie in approval for jesu from abraham but abraham know nothing of jesu or a messiah or anything christian i have try and fail to find any event in the old testament which correspond to john little prophecy it be par for the course to see st john make up old testament back just like hi forerunner matthew many christian know that their faith ha many of it foundation in such fraud and it be surprise they still cling to it the potter field we be tell that jesu wa betray while in jerusalem by one of hi follower juda iscariot matthew write mt and throw down the piece of silver in the temple juda depart but the chief priest take the silver say it be lawful for u to put it in the treasury since it be blood money so they buy a potter field with it to bury stranger in then wa fulfil what wa speak by the prophet jeremiah and they take the thirty piece of silver the price of him on whom a price have be set by some of the son of israel and they give them for the potter field a the lord direct me thi prophecy be an utterly gros bastardisation of old testament scripture first matthew ha make a mistake regard the name of the prophet it be zechariah who utter the verse which matthew make use of zech and they weigh out my wage thirty shekel of silver then yhvh say to me cast them to the treasury the lordly price at which i wa pay off by them so i take the thirty shekel of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of yhvh first of all the verse of zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of g the deal with a shepherd most likely a priest choose to serve a function of preside over the person shortly before g would send judah and israel into conflict with one another the word treasury have be replace by the king jame scholar with to the potter precisely because thi make matthew quote fit better but thi be a blatant error the correct translation of the hebrew be indeed treasury which also make perfect sense in zechariah context wherea potter field be totally unrelated whether the mistranslation wa intentional or not seem to be beyond speculation however give matthew track record one find it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty of course matthew would have ample reason for alter the text the thirty piece of silver match juda situation and if a most christian seem to be the reader be will to disregard the contextual incongruity matthew might have another prophecy to tos around however the correct translation of zechariah directly contradict the situation with juda and the high priest the high priest would not put the money in the treasury the worthles shepherd of zechariah do exactly the opposite of course to the average thursday-night bible student the prophecy a present by matthew would be take at new testament face value to those matthew work be convince enough wine vinegar casting lot then jesu be lead away to be crucify mt they give him vinegar to drink mingle with gall but when he taste it he would not drink it and when they have crucify him they divide hi garment among them by cast lot that it might be fulfil what wa speak by the prophet they part my garment among them and upon my vesture do they cast lot first of all the vinegar offer to jesu be actually common smy wine of the type that roman soldier drink regularly we find that right before jesu dy the soldier themself give him some to drink not pollute with gall jn jesu say i thirst a bowl of vinegar stand there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and hold it to hi mouth when he have receive the vinegar he say it be finish but matthew seem to be draw on not a passage from the prophet but one from the psalm ps i look for pity but there wa none and for comforter but i find none they give me poison for food light they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they give me vinegar to drink add to them punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from thee let them be blot out of the book of the living of course the smy wine offer to jesu be do at hi request of drink thi do indeed seem to be a show of pity the psalm quote be about david and hi political and military enemy it be not about the messiah or jesu it be then not surprise that we run into further problem when we see that the jesu in the psalm ask g for the damnation of the crucifier wherea the jesu of the gospel say lk jesu say father forgive them the do know what they do further matthew miss with hi attempt to create prophecy by have gall a bitter substance put into jesu drink not hi meat a the psalm stipulate with the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask what of the cast of lot thi bring up the psalm which deserve discussion all by itself suffice it now to say that the fact that jesu clothe be divide a tell be no great thing it turn out that thi happen often to any felon in those day a we will soon see it be perhap the least erroneou passage of the psalm when apply to jesu it do indeed bring up the interest question a to the quality of jesu clothe for a man so remove from worldly possession hi ownership of clothe worthy of cast lot raise some suspicion the psalm thi psalm be attribute to david a a lament of hi condition under the attack of hi enemy it become a song of praise to yhvh and of hope taken out of context part of it seem to fit the plight of jesu at the crucifixion quite well we will examine the primary passage verse my god my god why have you forsake me why be you so far from help me far from the word of my groan oh my god i cry by day but you do answer and by night but find no rest jesu be say to have cry the first sentence while on the cro thi suggest that the whole psalm be really about jesu rather than king david of course the rest of the first stanza do not fit a nicely to jesu or hi execution jesu be not picture a complain about the whole ordeal he be suppose to be like the lamb lead mute before it shearer indeed jesu do do much groan even when on the cro he certainly do not cry by both day and night on the cro but i be a worm and no man scorn by man all who see me mock at me they make face and wag their head he commit hi cause to yhvh so let him deliver him for he delight in him thi seem to fit jesu execution pretty well with the exception of the holy messiah be call a worm many bull encompas me they open their mouth widely at me like a raven and roar lion yea dog be round about me a company of evildoer encir-cle me they have pierce my hand and foot i can see all my bone they divide my garment among them and cast lose for my raiment but you yhvh be not far away deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflict soul from the horn of the wild bull it would seem quite convince and i sure the early christian father who write of thi prophecy think so too unfortunately thi prophecy ha a fatal flaw the word have pierce really do not exist in the psalm the correct hebrew translation be yea dog be round about me a company of evildoer encircle me like the lion they be at my hand and foot in hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierce differ by one phonetic character the word in the hebrew text be literally like the lion which make sense in the context and even further fit the animal imagery employ by the psalm writer it be convenience that would urge a christian to change the word to but to add the need yet artificial weight to the prophecy thi be just what the christian translator have choose to do while the correct translation do not eliminate the psalm from refer to jesu it absence do not say much for the honesty of the translator apart from the erroneou verse the psalm do not lend itself to jesu so easily verse speak of the sufferer be save from a sword rather than a cro thi naturally fit the psalm true subject king david a a side note we now know that crucifixion do not pierce the hand the palm but rather the forearm thi do say much in favmy of the traditional think of a resurrect jesu show hi disciple the scar on hi palm but then fact be bind by my religiou belief matthew escape culpability thi time a he do not attempt to draw many direct link between thi psalm and hi lord jesu but the psalm like many other wa on the mind of all the gospel writer when they compile the story and interpretation of jesu life and death how much these scripture may have contribute to what actually get write down be a question that ha seriou repercussion for christian theology it be easy to see for those who be not faithful fundamentalist how some of the event in the new testament might have be enhance by scribe such a the eager matthew but it do le to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matter and prophetic claim so far thi ha not say good thing for st matthew the reference to the pierce look a lot like jesu crucifixion john gospel recount write about year after the fact tell u at jesu execution jn but one of the soldier pierce hi side with a spear and out come blood and water these thing take place that scripture be fulfil the will look on him whom they pierce of course thi be build on a passage take blatantly out of context prophet zechariah tell u how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them zc and yhvh will give victory to judah and on that day i will seek to destroy the nation that come against jerusalem in judah and i will pmy a spirit of compassion and supplication on jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierce they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child john attempt to make up prophecy be perhap weaker that matthew attempt matthew at least usually excontext more than just one passage john error be grossly obviou and blatant here it do not speak well for any of the gospel writer a it help to show how the prophetic aspect of their religion be found reckoned with transgressor after hi arrest jesu be quickly execute for claim the jewish kingship messiahship according to one version of the gospel tale jesu get execute along with two thieve mk and with him they crucify two robber one on hi right one on hi leave and so the scripture wa fulfil which say he wa reckon with the transgressor here mark be try to link jesu to a passage in isaiah about the servant nation of israel the passage be not about the messiah for if one read the whole chapter of isaiah and it surround chapter one see that the servant be a nation the verse be also about what thi servant ha go through in the past not a prediction of what be to come in any event the servant be think of a a criminal thi also happen to fit the description of jesu had the passage really be about the messiah it still be not at all clear why execute jesu between two thieve would fulfill the prophecy in isaiah jesu would more fittingly fulfill it with hi whole ministry he wa consider a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hi career locking onto a single event be a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in thi case a we see that mark could have have make a better analogy with general comparison mark go on to tell u how those who be crucify with jesu also revile him thi be to be expect from a couple of robber of course in hi later recount st luke decide to change some thing luke tell u lk and one of the criminal who wa hang with him rail are you the messiah save yourself and u thi certainly fit with mark recount which tell how the person who crucify jesu say save yourself and that the robber do the same but then luke go on but the other criminal rebuke the first say do you fear g since you be under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly so for we be receive the due reward for my deed but thi man ha do nothing wrong and he say jesu remember me when you come in ymy kingdom and jesu answer verily i say to you today you will be with me in paradise now thi little dialogue seem highly contrive it stretch the imagination a bite to see thi picture of one ruffian rebuke hi fellow criminal with such eloquent speech we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lament over the goodnes of hi punishment and the justnes of hi suffer such a man apparently noble and of principle do seem likely to have be a robber we wonder at the amount of theatric create by luke of course luke recount also disagree with mark luke ha only one criminal revile jesu not both it be easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account wa make up but those who wish to believe it be all part of the error free word of g do not have thi avenue open thi be yet another example of a writer try to take an old testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit hi theology in thi case the embroidery create some embarrass problem a we have see the end of the world mt now come perhap one of the most extraordinary and embarrass passage in the new testament it be find in all three of the synoptic gospel story and cast some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity jesu mention the destruction of the jewish temple and build and hi disciple ask him about thi and about the end of the world which he ha be warn about the disciple tell u when will thi the temple destruction be and what will be the sign of ymy come and of the close of the age jesu take care that no one lead you astray for many will come in my name say i be the christ you will hear of war and rumour of war for thi must take place but the end be not yet for nation will rise against nation all thi be but the begin of the birthpang they will deliver you up put you to death and false prophet will arise and lead many astray but he who endure to the end will be save thi gospel will be preach throughout the whole world a testimony to the nation and then the end will come so when you see the desolation speak of by the prophet daniel let those who be in judea flee to the mountain immediately after the tribulation of those day the sun will be darken the star will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the tribe of the earth will mourn and see the son of man come and he will send out hi angel and gather hi elect learn the lesson of the fig tree a soon a it branch become tender and put forth leaf you know that summer be near so also when you see all these thing you will know that he be near at the very gate truly i say to you thi generation will not pa away until all these thing take place but of the day and hmy no one know not the angel not the son but only the father therefore you also must be ready for the son of man be come at an hmy you do not expect from thi it be clear that jesu think the world would in within the lifetime of at least some of hi disciple he tell them that although he do know the exact day or hmy that it will come and thu they must be ready theologian have wet their pant in panic to find some way out of thi holy error but unfortunately jesu make himself to explicit he tell hi disciple that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be sweep away there have be some who resort to remove the inerrant nature of the bible and say that the phrase thi generation shall not pa away really mean thi race of person will not pa away of course the word for generation be use many time to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciple it be an interest notion that when god decide to learn greek he do learn it well enough to make himself clear but it be quite obviou from the rest of the dialogue that the disciple at least some of them be suppose to live to the end of the world the charge of mistranslation be completely blow away by look at the apostle response it become abundantly clear from rev peter john and rev that jesu mean exactly what he say the end wa very near for year christian have rationalise thi chapter of matthew or ignore it mean altogether for year they have wait for their execute leader to come back hear of war and rumour of war sure that he be come soon surely he must be all we must do be wait can you imagine how tire he must be sit around up there be holy wait for just the right moment to spring so shortly after hi crucifixion jesu of nazareth joshua-ben-joseph die it be say that after three day or three day and three night or three period of time or three eternal second or three of whatever they can decide make for le trouble he wa see again resurrect glow with divine radiance then the savimy decide it wa in the best interest of hi new religion to stick around and therefore disappear from sight into heaven so the story go anyway a ha be see there be many thing attribute to jesu when person get around to write the gospel story down to them jesu wa the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture we have see though that thi matter be quite shaky but throughout church history christian have hold fast to faith in simple belief what doctrinal objection could not be solve with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulnes keep away from question to question and investigate ha never be the easiest way to treat matter thu for year the prophecy cite in the new testament have go on largely accept thing may well continue that way for some time pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrine of christianity have be accept and use properly or improperly to support war and persecution i suppose there be one prophecy of which christianity can securely keep hold mt jesu do think that i have come to bring peace on earth i have come to bring peace but rather a sword
