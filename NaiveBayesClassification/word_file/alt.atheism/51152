from acooper subject idle question for fellow atheist i wonder how many atheist out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheist be the majority rather than the minority group of the population it be rather a ridiculou question in some way i know but my newsreader be down so i be not get any new post for a bite so i figure i might a well post something new myself also how many atheist out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of think over the theistic way of think the typical selfish argument would be that both line of think evolve from the same inherent motivation so one be not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively but then again a measure stick must be draw somewhere and if we can not assign value to a system of belief at it core than the only other alternative be to apply it to it periphery ie how it express it own selfishnes idle think adam adam john cooper verily often have i laugh at the weakling who think themself good simply because acooper they have no claw
