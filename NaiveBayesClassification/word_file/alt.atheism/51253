from benedikt rosenau subject re american and evolution in article bob robert singleton write deletion i will argue that ymy latter statement i believe that no god exist do rest upon faith that be if you be make a positive statement that no god exist strong atheism rather than merely say i do know and therefore do believe in them and do not believe in then weak atheism once again to not believe in god be different than say i believe that god do not exist i still maintain the position even after read the faq that strong atheism require faith no it in the way it be usually use in my view you be say here that drive a car require faith that the car drife for me it be a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i have in the premise and the argument use but first let me say the follow we might have a language problem here in regard to faith and existence i a a christian maintain that god do not exist to exist mean to have be in space and time god do not have be god is being kierkegaard once say that god do not exist he be eternal with thi say i feel it rather pointles to debate the so call existence of god and that be not what i do here i believe that god be the source and grind of be when you say that god do not exist i also accept thi statement but we obviously mean two different thing by it however in what follow i will use the phrase the existence of god in it sense and thi be the sense that i think you be use it i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of god no that a word game the term god be use in a different way usually when you use a different definition it be ymy thing but until it be commonly accept you would have to say the way i define god be and that do not exist it be existence itself so i say it do not exist interestingly there be those who say that existence exist be one of the indubitable statement possible further say god be existence be either a waste of time existence be already use and there be no need to replace it by god or you be imply more with it in which case ymy definition and ymy argument so far be incomplete make it a fallacy deletion one can never prove that god do or do not exist when you say that you believe god do not exist and that thi be an opinion base upon observation i will have to ask what observtion be you refer to there be no observation pro or con that be valid here in establish a positive belief deletion where do that follow are observation base on the assumption that something exist and would you say there be a level of definition that the assumption god be be meaningful if not i would reject that concept anyway so where be ymy evidence for that god be be meaningful at some level benedikt
