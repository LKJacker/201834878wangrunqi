from darice fred rice subject re islam dres code for woman in benedikt rosenau write in article darice fred rice write deletion of course person say what they think to be the religion and that thi be not exactly the same come from different person within the religion there be nothing with there exist different perspective within the religion perhap one can say that they tend to converge on the truth my point be that they be do a lot of harm on the way in the meantime and that they converge be counterfactual religion appear to split and diverge even when there might be a religion at the core the layer above determine what happen in practise and they be quite inhumane usually what you post then be suppose to be an answer but i do see what be ha get to do with what i say i will repeat it religion a be harm person and religion do converge they split giving more to disagree upon and there be a lot of disagreement to whom one should be tolerant or if one should be tolerant at all ideology also split give more to disagree upon and may also lead to intolerance so do you also oppose all ideology i do think ymy argument be an argument against religion at all but just point out the weakness of human nature big deletion do woman have soul in islam person have say here that some muslim say that woman do not have soul i must admit i have never hear of such a view be hold by muslim of any era i have hear of some christian of some era hold thi viewpoint but not muslim are you sure you might not be confuse christian history with islamic history ye it be suppose to have be a predominant view in the turkish caliphate i would like a reference if you have get one for thi be news to me anyhow that woman be the spiritual equal of man can be clearly show from many verse of the for example the say for muslim man and woman for believe man and woman for devout man and woman for true man and woman for man and woman who be patient and constant for man and woman who humble themself for man and woman who give in charity for man and woman who fast and deny themself for man and woman who guard their chastity and for man and woman who engage much in god praise for them ha god prepare forgivenes and a great reward abdullah yusuf ali translation there be other quote too but i think the above quote show that man and woman be spiritual equal and thu that woman have soul just a man do very clearly no it do not it imply that they have soul but it do not say they have soul and it be not give that the quote above be give a high priority in all interpretation one must approach the with intelligence any think approach to the can not but interpret the above verse and other like it that woman and man be spiritual equal i think that the above verse do clearly imply that woman have soul do it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgive or to have a great reward understand to be in the after-life i think the usual answer would be no in which case the part say for them ha god prepare forgivenes and a great reward say they have soul if it make sense to say that thing without soul can be forgive then i have no idea what a soul be a for ymy say that the quote above may not be give a high priority in all interpretation any think approach to the ha to give all verse of the equal priority that be because accord to muslim belief the whole be the revelation of god in fact deny the truth of any part of the be sufficient to be consider a disbeliever in islam quite similar to you other post even when the quran do not encourage slavery it be not justify to say that iit forbid or put an end to slavery it be a non sequitur look any approach to the must be do with intelligence and think it be in thi fashion that one can try to understand the quran message in a book of finite length it can not explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through it teach it can guide you i think however that woman be the spiritual equal of man be clearly and unambiguously imply in the above verse and that since woman can clearly be forgive and reward they must have soul from the above verse let try to understand what the be try to teach rather than try to see how many way it can be misinterpret by ignore thi passage or that passage the misinterpretation of the base on ignore thi verse or that verse be infinite but the interpretation fully consistent be more limit let try to discus these interpretation consistent with the text rather than how person can ignore thi bite or that bite for that be just show how person can try to twist islam for their own end something i do not deny but provide no reflection on the true teach of islam whatsoever fred rice darice
