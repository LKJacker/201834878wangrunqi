from darice fred rice subject re slavery wa re why be sex only allow in marriage in guncer selim guncer write you might not like what bernard lewi write about label him a a zionist or such to discredit him etc you misrepresent me selim the hard evidence for my statement about hi lack of objectivity be present quite clearly in the book orientalism by edward said edward said by the way be a christian not a muslim i think he be pretty much objective in hi treatment in race and slavery in the middle east since he clearly distinguish between slavery under islam and the practice of slavery in other country like the u prior to the civil war he also do not conceal that there be verse in the quran which promote the liberation of slave what he do and i do think nobody can deduce from these verse be that slavery will eventually be abolish in islamic country now you might rather conveniently blame the practice of slavery on muslim but the fact be out there i also fail to see the relevance of the claim of lewi be a zionist to what i write regarding bernard lewi him be a zionist gife him a political motive for hi give misrepresentation and half-truth about islam read orientalism by edward said see the evidence for yourself in fact i may post some of it here if it be too long they be encyclopaedic information which anybody can acces that slavery wa abolish at certain date some year after muhammed that thi wa the cause of tension in the ottoman empire between the arab slave trader and the government etc we also have in the asu library volume of british document on slavery where report and document concern slavery all around the world can be find which i check some of the incident lewi mention so i do think one political stance ha anything to do with documentary evidence i have read lewi article so i ca comment directly upon it and have only speak about hi write in general so far that hi political motive make him a bias writer on islam hi anti-islamic polemic a i understand it be often quite subtle and be often base on tell half-truth again read orientalism by edward said i be not ask you to take what i say on trust in fact i be urge you not to do so but to get thi book it be a well-known book and check the evidence out for yourself the issue i raise wa that slave were used for sexual purpose when it wa claim that islam prohibit extra-marital sex i write that the prophet himself have concubine i write an incident in which the prophet advise on someone who do not want hi concubine to get pregnant etc which be contrary to the notion that sex be for procreation only in other word such claim be baseles in the quran and the hadith if slavery be in reality a oppose to in the practice of some muslim oppose by islam then use slave for sexual purpose be necessarily oppose too i seem to be unsuccesful in get through to you islam be not advocate slavery slavery wa an exist institution in the century it advise on slave be free for good deed etc which be nothing new many culture saw thi a a good thing what be the problem here but i can argue rightfully that slave be discourage about think about their status politically the quran reward the good slave so obey ymy master and perhap one day you be free but it be very understandable that i do not communicate with muslim since they assume the quran be from a god and i think it be a rule-based system impose on the society for preservation of the statu quo slave be a part of thi system the subordination of woman so that their function in society boil down to child-making be a part of thi system etc i understand ymy point of view selim i think rather it be u who be not get through to you some of the point you repeat above i have already answer before regarding woman i have make post after post on thi subject show that islam be not anti-woman etc however have you be completely ignore my post or just miss them i just reposted a very good one under the title islam and woman reposted from if thi ha already disappear from ymy site then please email me tell me so and i will email you a copy of thi excellent article imho ymy understand of the issue of woman in islam be sadly deficient regarding slave my post on slavery the second one i make which be a repost of an article i write early last year be base completely on the and contain numerou verse and hadith to support it point of view my approach be different you be argue from a historical standpoint and i be argue directly from the teach of the and hadith now just because person say they be muslim and perform a particular action do that automatically mean that their action be part of islam even if it be oppose by the and sunnah no of course not let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify thi for you the prohibit drink now if a person say i be a muslim and then proceed to drink a bottle of beer do thi now mean that islam teach that person should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point it be very natural to think that the of the quran have no idea that the socio-economic structure they be advocate would experience at least two paradigm shift in year in the western culture first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial revolution well rule have change and the statu quo ha drive muslim country into misery try to survive in a heathen world muslim country have fail economically they be unable to accumulate any wealth directly due to the uncomprimising economic rule in the quran in fact the rise of islam can easily be model after the pyramid effect you do not produce any wealth at home but increase ymy wealth by conquer place you be judge islam here on capitalist term capitalism be an ideology base largely on the assumption that person want to maximise their wealth thi assumption be in opposition to islamic teach to say islam be bad because it be not capitalist be pretty unthinking islam do not pretend to be capitalist and do not try to be capitalist thi do not mean that islam do not support a free-market for it do in general but there be other part of capitalism which be oppose to islam a i understand it when thi stop you and i be leave bare in the open for emperialist to devmy no capital no industry very poor social service the education level in muslim country be the lowest in the world the health statistic be miserable etc one can postulate numerou reason for thi ymy theory be that it be because islam be not secularist and capitalist etc etc selim i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of ymy view if you think a you obviously do that islam lack of education and power for a large part of history the islamic world wa very powerful for a significant section of history the islamic world wa the foremost in the science so to say that islam be for example anti-education be completely absurd you try to blame thi situation on islam history show that ymy conclusion be false and that instead there must be other reason for thi situation you blame muslim for not follow the quran but i blame muslim for follow the quran well selim ymy viewpoint on woman in islam make me question the extent of ymy knowledge of islam i really think you be not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslim be follow the or not ymy idea be baseles from historical fact it be a poor utopium the islamic world wa at the forefront of the world in science at one stage yet somehow in ymy theory it be by follow the that muslim be backward in education selim it be ymy thesi that be anti-historical for you conveniently overlook thi historical fact which contradict ymy theory while my idea be derive from social and economic history you have certainly not show thi you have merely state it so far it seem to me that ymy view on islam be anti-education be quite contrary to history that you be so convince of ymy view make me wonder just how objectively you be try to look at all of thi my solution to all muslim be simple cut the crap i think selim you should consider take ymy own advice get the fact straight here too and work hard to reverse the effect of year of ignorance selim you have such conviction of ymy viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to muslim be leader of science till about or so i think yet you say that ymy viewpoint be base on history selim if i remember right you say in one of ymy earlier post that you be an apostate from islam i think you should slow down and start think clearly about the issue and start read some of my post about islam rather than ignore them a you so obviously have fred rice darice
