from kempmp petrus pihko subject re concerning god morality long thi kind of argument cry for a comment jbrown write in article galahad scott compton write jim you originally write god do not create disease nor be he responsible for the malady of newborn what god do create wa life accord to a protein code which be mutable and can evolve without delve into a deep discussion of creationism v evolutionism god create the original genetic code perfect and without flaw do you have any evidence for thi if the code wa once perfect and ha degrade ever since we should have some evidence in favmy of thi statement should we perhap the biggest imperfection of the code be that it be full of non-coding region intron which be so call because they intervene with the cod region exon an impressive amount of evidence suggest that intron be of very ancient origin it be likely that early exon represent early protein domain is the number of intron decrease or increase it appear that intron los can occur and specie with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their gene on the other hand the possibility that intron have be insert later present several logical difficulty intron be remove by a splice mechanism thi would have to be present but unused if intron be insert moreover intron insertion would have require precise target random insertion would not be tolerate since sequence for intron removal self-splicing of mrna be conserve beside transposition of a sequence usually leaf a trace long terminal repeat and target site duplication and these be not find in or near intron sequence i seriously recommend read textbook on molecular biology and genetic before post theological argument like thi try watson molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish baltimore molecular biology of the cell for starter remember the question wa pose in a theological context why do god cause disease in newborn and my answer be likewise from a theological perspective my own it be no le valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective be support by the evidence wherea theological perspective often fail to fulfil thi criterion i think you misread my mean i say god make the genetic code perfect but that do mean it perfect now it ha certainly evolve since for the worse would you please cite a few reference that support ymy assertion ymy assertion be le valid than the scientific perspective unles you support it by some evidence in fact it ha be claim that parasite and disease be perhap more important than we think for instance sex might have evolve a defence against parasite thi view be support by computer simulation of evolution eg tierra perhap i think it wa higher energy ray like x-ray gamma ray and cosmic ray that cause most of the damage in fact it be thermal energy that do most of the damage although it be usually mild and easily fix by enzymatic action actually neither of u know what the atmosphere wa like at the time when god create life according to my recollection most biologist do not claim that life begin billion year ago after all that would only be a half billion year or so after the earth wa create it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember a figure more like to billion year ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a better estimate i replace create with form since there be no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be form without one most recent estimate of the age of the earth range between billion year and earliest sign of life not true fossil but organic stromatolite-like layer date back to billion year thi would leave more than billion year for the first cell to evolve i sorry i ca give any reference thi be base on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attend here dominion it wa no great feat for satan to genetically engineer disease both and genetic although the force of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of specie the degeneration of the genetic code tend to more than offset thi again do you want thi be true or do you have any evidence for thi suppose degeneration i can understand scott reaction excuse me but thi be so far-fetched that i know you must be jest do you know what pathogen be do you know what point mutation be do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to ymy last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it a fact but you can not know that i hope you do forget thi we have evidence that suggest everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against thi conclusion in science one do not have to believe in anything it be a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk be to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one own conclusion prior to thi theology do not use thi method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusion human dna be more complex tend to accumulate error adversely affect my well-being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacterium and viruse tend to become more efficient in cause infection and disease it be a bad combination hence we have newborn that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial you be suppose a purpose not a valid move bacterium and viruse do not exist to cause disease they be just another manifest of a general principle of evolution only replication save replicator from degradiation we be just an efficient method for my dna to survive and replicate the le efficient method do make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for ymy claim that human dna be degrade through evolutionary process some person have claim that the opposite be true we have suppress my selection and thu be bind to degrade i have see much evidence for either claim but then i ask so where be thi relevant to my discussion in answer john question of why why be there genetic disease and why be there so many bacterial and viral disease which require baby to develop antibody is it god fault the original question i say no it be not of course nothing evil be god fault but ymy explanation do not work it fail miserably you may be right but the fact be that you do know that satan be not responsible and neither do i suppose that a powerful evil be like satan exist would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ill that affect mankind i do think so he could have do a much better job pun intend the problem be it seem no satan be necessary to explain any disease they be just a inevitable a any product of evolution did i say that where seem to me like another bad inference actually what you do be to oversimplify what i say to the point that ymy summary of my word take on a new context i never say that person be mean presumably by god to be punish by get disease why i do say be that free moral choice have attendent consequence if mankind choose to reject god a person have do since the begin then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse event in an entropic universe i be not expect thi if god exist i expect him to leave u alone i would also like to hear why do you believe ymy choice be indeed free thi be an interest philosophical question and the answer be not a clear-cut a it seem to be what consequence would you expect from reject allah oh i admit it not perfect yet but i work on it a good library or a bookstore be a good start point what do thi have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provide an answer biology and genetic be fine subject and important scientific endeavor but they explain how god create and set up life process they do explain the why behind creation life or it subsequent evolution why be there a why behind and ymy proposition wa something that be not support by the evidence thi be why we recommend these book is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for thi if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention a recent cosmological theory hawking et al suggest why do person still insist on thi thank scotty for ymy fine and sagely advice but i be not highly motivate to learn all the nitty-gritty detail of biology and genetic although i sure i find it a fascinate subject for i realize that the detail do not change the big picture that god create life in the begin with the ability to change and adapt to it environment i sorry but they do there be no evidence for ymy big picture and no need to create anything that be capable of adaptation it can come into existence without a supreme being try read atkin creation revisited freeman petrus petrus pihko kem-pmp
