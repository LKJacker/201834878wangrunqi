from darice fred rice subject re why be sex only allow in marriage rationality wa islamic marriage in lucio lucio de re write darice fred rice write my point of view be that the argument all sexism be bad just simply do not hold let me give you an example how about permit a woman to temporarily leave her job due to pregnancy should that be allow it happen to be sexist a it gife a particular right only to woman nevertheles despite the fact that it be sexist i completely support such a law because i think it be just fred you exasperate sexism like racialism be a form of discrimination use obviou physical or cultural difference to deny one portion of the population the same right a another in thi context ymy example above hold no water whatsoever there no discrimination in deny man maternity leave in fact i quite convince that be anyone to experiment with male pregnancy it would be possible for such a future father to take leave on medical grind okay i argue thi thoroughly about week ago man and woman be different physically physiologically and psychologically much recent evidence for thi statement be present in the book brainsex by anne moir and david jessel i recommend you find a copy and read it their book be an overview of recent scientific research on thi topic and be well reference now if woman and man be different in some way the law can only adequately take into account their need in these area where they be different by also take into account the way in which man and woman be different maternity leave be an example of thi it take into account that woman get pregnant it do not give woman the same rule it would give to man because to treat woman like it treat man in thi instance would be unjust thi be just simply an obviou example of where man and woman be intrinsically different now person make the naive argument that sexism oppression however maternity leave be sexist because man do not get pregnant man do not have the same acces to leave that woman do not to the same extent or degree and therefore it is sexist no matter however much a man want to get pregnant and have maternity leave he never can and therefore the law is sexist no man can have acces to maternity leave no matter how hard he try to get pregnant i hope thi be clear maternity leave be an example where a sexist law be just because the sexism here just reflect the sexism of nature in make man and woman different there be many other difference between man and woman which be far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these i recommend you have a look at the book brainsex ymy point that perhap some day man can also be pregnant be fallaciou if man can one day become pregnant it will be by have biologically become woman to have a womb and the other factor require for pregnancy be usually wrap up in the definition of what a woman be so ymy argument when it be examine be see to be fallaciou you be say that man can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that woman can have if they also become woman which actually just support my statement that maternity leave be sexist the discrimination come in when a woman be deny opportunity because of her legally determine sexual inferiority a i understand most religiou sexual discrimination and i doubt that islam be exceptional the female be not allow into the priestly caste and in general be subjugate so that she ha no aspiration to right which a an equal human she ought to be entitle to there be no official priesthood in islam much of thi function be take by islamic scholar there be female islamic scholar and female islamic scholar have alway exist in islam an example from early islamic history be the prophet widow aisha who wa recognize in her time and be recognize in my time a an islamic scholar no matter how sweetly you coat it part of the role of religion seem historically to have serve the function of oppress the female whether by force her to procreate to the extent where there be no opportunity for self-improvement or by deny her acces to the same facility the male be offer you have no evidence for ymy blanket statement about all religion and i dispute it i could go on and on about woman in islam etc but i recently reposted something here under the head islam and woman if it be still at ymy news-site i suggest you read it it be reposted from so if it ha disappear from it still might be in i forget what it original title wa though i will email it to you if you like the roman catholic church be the most blatant of the culprit because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy but the other religiou be no different let a woman attempt to escape her role a child bearer and the wrath of god descend on her ymy statement that other religion be no different be i think a statement base simply on lack of knowledge about religion other than christianity and perhap judaism i accept ymy affirmation that islam grant woman the same right a man when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the same position a say khomeini and there be no artificial religiou or social obstacle on her path to achieve thi aisha who i mention earlier wa not only an islamic scholar but also wa at one stage a military leader show me the equivalent of hillary rhodam-clinton within islam and i may consider discuss the issue with you the prophet first wife who die just before the hijra the prophet journey from mecca to medina wa a successful businesswoman lucio you can not make a strong case for ymy viewpoint when ymy viewpoint be base on ignorance about world religion fred rice darice
