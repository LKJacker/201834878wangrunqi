from kcochran keith justified and ancient cochran subject we do need no stink subject in article keith keith allan schneider write kcochran keith justified and ancient cochran write keith keith allan schneider write kcochran keith justified and ancient cochran write no if you go to claim something then it be up to you to prove it think cold fusion well i provide example to show that the trend wa general and you or other have provide some counterexample mostly one surround mat practice etc i do think that these few case be enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality and again the mat practice need to be reexamine so what you say be that ymy mind be make up and you just explain away any difference at be statistically insignificant try to find immoral non-mating-related activity so you exclude mating-related-activity from ymy natural morality no but mat practice be a special case i have to think about it some more so you just explain away any inconsistancy in ymy theory a be a special case ye i think that the natural system can be objectively deduce with the goal of specie propogation in mind but i be not equate the two a you so think that be an objective system be necessarily the natural one are you or be you not the man who write a natural moral system be the objective moral system that most animal follow indeed but while the natural system be objective all objective system be not the natural one so the term can not be equate the natural system be a subset of the objective one you just equate them re-read ymy own word now since homosexuality ha be observe in most animal include bird and dolphin be you go to claim that most animal have the capacity of be immoral i do claim that homosexuality be immoral it be harmful although it be helpful either to the mat proces and when you say that homosexuality be observe in the animal kingdom do you mean bisexuality a study release in find that of female seagull be lesbian well i say that these goal be not inherent that be why they must be postulate because there be not really a way to determine them otherwise although it could be argue that they arise from the natural goal but they be somewhat remove postulate to assume posit that right the goal themself be inherent i can create a theory with a postulate that the sun revolf around the earth that the moon be actually make of green cheese and the star be the portion of angel that intrude into three-dimensional reality you could but such would contradict observation now apply thi last sentence of ymy to ymy theory notice how ymy be contridicting observation i can build a mathematical proof with a postulate that give the length of one side of a triangle the length of a second side of the triangle and the degree of angle connect them i can determine the length of the third side but a postulate be something that be generally or alway find to be true i do think ymy postulate would be valid you do know much math do you the ability to use sa to determine the length of the third side of the triangle be fundemental to geometry gues which one person be go to be more receptive to in order to assume something about ymy system you have to be able to show that ymy postulate work ye and i think the goal of survival and happiness do work you think they do or be they not good goal goal postulate again if one of the goal of thi morality system you be propose be survival of the specie then homosexuality be immoral kcochran b c d e f g k m r s t tsakc my think my post my idea my responsibility my beer my pizza ok
