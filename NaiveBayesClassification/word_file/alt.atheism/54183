from mathew mathew subject re after year can we say that christian morality be arromdee ken arromdee write simple take out some physic book and start look for statement which say that there be no objective physic i doubt you will find any you might find statement that there be no objective length or no objective location but no objective physic perhap you have a different understand of what physic be if we ca measure anything objectively then the answer we get from physic be objective either that what i mean when i say there no objective physic sure we can all agree that say f but that math it only physic when you relate it to the real world and if we ca do that objectively we stick of course thi display my blatant bia toward apply science but even theoretical physic get apply to model of real world situation base on real world observation consider for instance that speed-of-light-in vacuum be invariant thi sound an awful lot like an objective speed-of-light-in-vacuum it an axiom that it invariant but if the two of u measure it we get different answer ye we call that experimental error but it not really error in the conventional sense in fact if you do get any that an error you could argue that the value of c be objective to within some value but i call that a rather odd usage of the word objective and it open the way for statement like murder be objectively wrong for all person to within of the total population mathew
