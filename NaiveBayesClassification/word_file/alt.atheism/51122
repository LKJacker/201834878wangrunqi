from benedikt rosenau subject re a visit from the jehovah witness in article jbrown write did you say lucifer wa create with a perfect nature ye define perfect then i think you be play the usual game here make sweep statement like omni holy or perfect and do note that they mean exactly what they say and that say that you must not use thi term when it lead to contradiction i not try to play game here but i understand how it might seem that way especially when one be come from a completely different point of view such a atheism take ymy foot out of ymy mouth i wonder about that already when i wa a catholic christian the fact that the contradiction be unresolvable be one of the reason why i be an atheist believe me i believe similar sentence for a long time but that show the power of religion and not anything about it claim now god could have prevent lucifer fall by take away hi ability to choose between moral alternative worship god or worship himself but that would mean that god wa in error to have make lucifer or any be with free will in the first place exactly god allow evil an evil if there ever wa one now that an opinion or at best a premise but from my point of view it be not a premise which be necessary true specifically that it be an evil to allow evil to occur it follow from a definition of evil a ordinarily use letting evil happen or allow evil to take place in thi place even cause evil be another evil but could you give a definition of free will especially in the presence of an omniscient be will be self-determination in other word god create consciou be who have the ability to choose between moral choice independently of god all will therefore be free will the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creature will do even before the omnipotent ha create them there be no choice leave all be know the course of event be fix not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by jame tim if god be omniscient then clearly create be with free moral choice be a greater good than the emergence of ungodlines since he create them know the outcome in advance why be it the greater good to allow evil with the knowledge that it will happen why not make a unipolar system with the possibility of do good or not do good but that do not necessarily imply do evil it be logically possible but ymy god ha not do it i do not know that such be logically possible if god restrain a free be choice to choose to do evil and simply do not good then can it be say that the be truly ha a free moral choice and if good be define a love and obey god and avoid those behavior which god prohibit then how can you say that one who be not good be not evil a well like i say i be not sure that do not good without do evil be logically possible and when i be not omnipotent how can i have free will you have say something about choice and the scenario gife them therefore we have what you define a free will imagine the follow i can do good to other be but i can not harm them easily implement by make everyone appreciate be the object of good deed but do make them long for them so they can not feel the absence of good a evil but whose case be i argue it be conceivable so the omnipotent can do it or it would not be omnipotent if you want logically consistent a well you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first deletion perhap it be weak in a way if i be just speculate about the ubiquitou pink unicorn then there would be no basi for such speculation but thi idea of god do just fall on me out of the blue or while read science fiction or fantasy i know that some will disagree the bible describe a god who be omniscient and nevertheles create be with free moral choice from which the definitional logic follow but that not all there be to it there seem to be at least in my mind a certain amount of evidence which indicate that god exist and that the biblical description of him may be a fair one it be that evidence which bolster the argument in my view that the bible describe an omniscient and omnipotent god destroy the credibility of the bible nothing le and a lot of person would be interest in evidence for a god unfortunately there ca be any with these definition benedikt
