from mandtbacka mat andtbacka subject re after year can we say that christian morality be in hfj frank write deletium in case anybody have notice frank and i be debate objective morality and seemingly hit semantic secondly how can i refute ymy definition i can only point up it logical implication and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word objective in other area indeed by ymy definition an objective x be an oxymoron for all x i have no quibble with that belief other than that it be useles and that objective be a perfectly good word it may be that be a non-native english-speaker i misunderstand ymy usage of objective and try to debate something you do assert my apology i at a los to imagine what you really do mean though how many age can the universe have and still be internally self consistent i be amaze if it wa more than one how many different moral system can different member of society have indeed single individual in some case and humanity still stick together begging the question person can have many opinion about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together you be say that the universe ha a real age independent of my belief about it why wrong point the age of the universe ha no direct effect on humanity stick power in the way the moral system of a society can have i say the universe ha a real age because i see evidence for it cosmology astronomy and so on i say thi age be independent of person opinion of it because i know different person have a lot of different opinion in the matter yet empirical test consistently seem to give roughly the same result the age of the universe like most scientific fact can be emirically verify through mean that give the same result no matter who perform the test albeit there be error bar that may be on the largish side thi assume that the universe ha a real age or any kind of reality which do depend on what we think i ca see how it do that put a creationist to the task of perform the test and calculation see to it s he make no blatant error in measure or calculate and the result of the test will be the same why should an extreme biblical creationist give a rat a about the mean of which you speak because logically consistent empirical test contradict their opinion if those test be just my opinion then their own test which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we conduct say test in identical manner no they do which i take a show these test have some validity beyond my opinion of them i hear of no way to verify morality in a consistent way much le compute the error of the measurement care to enlighten me the same be true of pain but painkiller exist and can be predict to work with some accuracy better than a random gues map the activity of nerve and neural activity if you mean physical pain you have a sharp point i give you that but you still have give me a way to quantify morality i write elsewhere that morality should be hypothesis about observe value we agree hypothesis however can change i hold that there be no ultimate hypothesi of morality toward which these change could gravitate but that they could be change in any way imaginable produce different result suitable for different task or purpose if a moral system make a prediction it will be better if that can be test better and worse be almost alway define in the context of a moral system ymy prediction will alway be correct within that moral system what you need now be an objective definition of good and bad i wish you luck person idea about the age of object x be not objective you can have any idea you like and i ca stop you universa and their age be another ballgame they be what they be and if you dislike some detail of them that a problem with ymy opinion of them sure assume an objective reality and you get statement like thi is that what do when assume an objectively real morality beside what exactly be provably wrong with my statement i claim that morality be an opinion of our and a such subjective and individual if i wrong then some more-or-les objectively real thing exist which you label objective morality can you back up thi positive claim of existence can you back up ymy positive claim above no that because it an assumption i make the same assumption about value on the basi that there be no logical difference between the two and the empirical basi of the two be precisely the same claiming there be no objective morality be suddenly a positive claim beside i think i can lend some credence to my claim ponder different individual both fully functional a human be and member of society but yet with wildly different moral code if morality wa objective at least one should be way off base but yet hir morality seem to function fine how come a for produce these individual it might be easiest to pick them from different society say an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system for example if such still exist deletium test for football on desk now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform me which way to look and why to look that particular way a oppose to some other get my drift no just look are you claim never to know what good mean one thing be good under some circumstance because we wish to achieve some goal for some reason other time we wish to do something else and that thing be no longer so clearly good at all some thing be hard to make good because we seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal ma murder would lead one into still the aztec be do fine until the spaniard wipe them out i almost alway know what good mean sometime i even know why i never claim thi good be thereby fix in stone immutable that a simple matter of prove the track record of the scientific method i think it great and should be apply to value i may be completely wrong but that what i conclude a a result of quite an amount of think ye me too and i try a thing or two down that line it do look good for objective value to me at all disclaimer it great to be young and insane
