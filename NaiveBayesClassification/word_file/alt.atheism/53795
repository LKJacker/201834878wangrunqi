from frank frank subject re bayesian statistic theism and atheism in article simon simon clippingdale write in article frank frank write in article simon simon clippingdale write i write imagine that alterian dollar turn up in ymy bank account every month suppose further that thi money be be pay to you by a ymy big-hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm let suppose that thi be a true dichotomy so p a p b trouble be alteriu be in a different universe so that no observation of alteriu be possible except for the bank you could possibly afford it now let examine the case for a there be no evidence whatsoever that there be any such thing a a big-hearted alterian benefactor however p exist b-h a b p not exist b-h a b on the grind that be when we have a partition like that we dismis hypothesi a turning therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that hypothesi on the same grind a before we dismis hypothesi b the problem with thi be that we have dismiss all of the possible hypothesis and even though we know by construction that the money arrife every month we have prove that it ca because we have dismiss all of it potential cause that an extremely poor argument and here why premise thi money be be pay to you by either a ymy big hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm thu each monthly appearance of the buck should it happen be an observation on alteriu and by construction be evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm premise no observation on alteriu be possible except for the bank you could possibly afford it you forget to include thi my premise be actually premise the cardinality of the set of possible observation on alteriu be one thi be clearly contradictory to the first not if you state it properly trouble be on the basi of premise you say that there can be no evidence of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise lead to the conclusion that the appearance of the buck should it happen be evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug voila a scream contradiction with my highlight sc but in a strawman argument there be only evidence for oneof benefactor bug no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug be possible that be not evidence for bug and neither be it evidence for benefactor nor be true to say that thi hypothetical universe appear exactly a if there be no two statement both would be false thi be still contradictory it reduce to alterian dosh arrive in my account be due to benefactor or bug thi be not evidence for benefactor neither be it evidence for bug mean that it do lend more weight to one than to the other therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence can exist for bug but rely on a shift in mean from when you say paraphrase in that thi be not evidence for benefactor for example what you mean be that it no more evidence for benefactor than it be for bug ye that what i mean in however you shift the mean of evidence for benefactor so that it now mean absolute evidence for benefactor rather than relative evidence for benefactor bug not really i mean evidence that would tend to one over the other i think thi be just a communication problem what i be try to say in my clumsy way be that while i buy ymy theory a far a it relate to theism make prediction prayer ymy example i do buy ymy use of occam razor in all case where in my example one could dismis benefactor or bug on the grind of simplicity one of these be necessary to explain the dosh i bring up the dismissal proces to show that it would be wrong to do so from what you say in thi post it seem you agree and we talk at cross-purpose be still in contradiction to some sum may help with b benefactor b bug d dosh arrife in account imply p d assuming that p bb d so it either the benefactor or a bug which be responsible if the buck arrive but not both then p d p b d p b d so p b d p b d but imply that p b d and p b d no thi be what i mean p b d and p b d with necessarily no new observation we already see the dosh to change those estimate i wa try to say again in my clumsy way that it would be wrong to assign probability to either of these and that precisely what use of the razor do in the case of god god be one clas of hypothesi there be many other belong to a set of hypothesis be necessary to explain something which otherwise would not be satisfactorily explain it can be throw out or retain on grind of non-rational preference not of science or statistic alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grind that the answer ca be know or that the notional probability estimate be effectively useles be equal atheism a they do when the set m be fill by the universe be cause by x where x be god pink unicorn nothing etc and no observation tend to one conclusion over the other exactly the point i wa make i think so we do throw out any of these contrary to ymy assertion above that we do some person do simon and they think they be do excellent science my sole point wa that they be only observation which directly contradict the hypothesi h i x where p x h i can cause p h i to go to zero after a finite number of observation only in thi case do we get to throw any of the hypothesis out exactly my point though i may have be unclear you say the diametric opposite which i gues be the source of my confusion i wa merely try to illustrate the incorrectnes of do so what i try to say be that while you be correct to say that absence of evidence can sometime be evidence of absence thi do not hold true for all or perhap any version of theism and it be true that those for which it do not hold can be discard use the razor on the contrary those for which it do not hold be exactly those which can be discard use the razor see my post on the other branch of thi thread then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of if the razor hold for god then it hold for all like hypothesis which mean that you assign p x h i for all i though we already establish that it not correct to do so when sum p i over all i simply put anyone who claim to have a viable proof of the existence or non-existence of god whether inductive or no be at best mistake and at worst bark mad luckily i make no such claim and have specifically say a much on numerou occasion you would be construct a strawman here would you frank although that do of course rule out my be bark mad in any case i could be bark mad in my spare time with apology to cleese et al but i think you mi the point once again when i say that something be evidence against an hypothesi that do imply that observation of the say something necessarily falsify the hypothesi reduce the estimate of p h datum to zero if it reduce thi quantity it still evidence against h no i get that i talk about the case when you clearly correct when a and i not construct a strawman though it certainly possible that i misunderstand what you say however by any standard a system that say when god be highly unlikely and when a god can be dismiss use the razor be a system purport to be an inductive proof that god either do exist or be unnecessary to explain any or all phenomenon in my experience system such a thi include those which purport to prove that god exist alway contain a fallacy upon close examination if that not what you say then please put me straight frank not hatch that odwyer from hen by evelyn conlon
