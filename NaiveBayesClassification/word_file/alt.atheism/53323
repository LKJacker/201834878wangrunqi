from jbrown subject re death penalty gulf war long in article mathew mathew write jbrown write in article mathew mathew write which liberal news medium be we talk about western news in general but in particular the american ma medium cb nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war wa one of those poor poor iraqi along with look how precisely thi cruise missile blow thi build to bite most odd over here there wa very little about the suffer of the iraqi civilian until toward the end of the war and then it wa confine to the few remain quality newspaper true at first the news medium seem entrance by all the new gizmo the military wa use not to mention the tap video transmission from the missile a they zero in on their target but later and especially after the bunker full of civilian wa hit they change their tone it seem to me that they do have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent person really do die and be maim in warfare it like they be only pro-gulf-war a long a it wa nice and clean smart missile drop in on military hq but not when picture of dead die and maim civilian start crop up what naive hypocrite how about all the innocent person who die in blanket-bombing in i do hear you bemoan them discussion about blanket-bombing and a-bomb delete all thing consider the fire-bombing and the atomic bomb be essential and therefore justify in bring the war to a quick end to avoid even greater ally loss i should have say here militarily justify it seem from ymy comment below that you understand thi a mean morally justify i apologize what about the evidence that america know japan wa about to surrender after hiroshima but before nagasaki is that another lie peddle by the liberal medium conspiracy i have often wonder about thi i alway think that the first bomb should have be drop on japan island fortres of truk a good inpenatrable military target the second bomb could be hold back for use on an industrial center if need be but i digres ye i have hear that we find evidence after the war btw that japan wa seriously consider surrender after the first bomb unfortunately the military juntum win out over the moderate and reject the u ulimatum therefore the second bomb wa drop most unfortunate imo i for one do regret it nuke a jap for jesu i do regret the fact that sometime military decision have to be make which affect the life of innocent person but i do regret the circumstance which make those decision necessary and i regret the suffer cause by those decision why all the fus about kuwait and not east timor bosnium or even tibet if iraq be so bad why be we still sell them stuff a couple of week before we start bomb i make no claim or effort to justify the misguide foreign policy of the west before the war it be evident that the west especially america misjudge hussein drastically but once hussein invade kuwait and threaten to militarily corner a significant portion of the world oil supply he have to be stop oh i see so we can overlook hi use chemical weapon on thousand of person but if he threaten ymy right to drive a huge gas-guzzling car well the man get tum go actually it wa the fact that both situation exist that prompt u and ally action if some back-water country take over some other back-water country we probably would intervene not that we do care but we ca be the world policman or if a coup have occur in kuwait instead of an invasion then we still would have act because there would not have be the imminent danger perceive to saudi arabium but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west oil interest cause u to take action i move a paragraph from here to later on if we have intervene allow hussein to keep kuwait then it would have be appeasement right but do you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action or be you just set up a strawman i not set up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative wa to allow hussein to keep kuwait diplomatic alternative include sanction be ineffective i gues we should have fight either just think of all those innocent german civilian kill in dresden and hamburg ye do german be human too you know sure what wa truly unfortunate wa that they follow hitler in hi grandiose quest for a thousand year reich the consequence stem from that translation they be ask for it well in a sense ye they probably have no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to but what about those who do support hitler dream of conquest it not a if they democratically vote for all hi policy the nsdap get in the election of and that wa the last chance the german person get to vote on the matter they suffer along with the rest why do thi bother you so much the world be full of evil and circumstance be not perfect many innocent suffer due to the wrongful action of other it it regretable but that the-way-it-i there be no perfect solution i look forward to hear ymy incisive comment about east timor and tibet what should i say about them anything in particular the person of east timor be still be kill by a dictatorship that invade their country hell even western journalist have be kill all thi wa happen before the gulf war why do we send in the bomber to east timor why be we send in the bomber now probably because we not the savior of the world we ca polouse each and every country that decide to self-destruct or invade another nor be we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other place here that paragraph i move what ymy intent to sound like a loving christian well you be do a very good job of it well it not very love to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby country and keep them or to allow them to continue with ma slaughter of certain people under their dominion so i have to say ye stop hussein wa the most love thing to do for the most person involve once he set hi mind on military conquest the chinese government ha a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization of tibetan tibetan person be round up torture and execute amnesty international recently report that torture be still widespread in china why be we stop them in fact why be we actively suck up to them by trade freely with them tell me how we could stop them and i support it i for one do not agree with the present u policy of suck up to them a you put it i agree that it be deplorable and a for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial bring back a verdict of not guilty ye amongst the thing i think be hmm there an awful lot of white person in that jury so it wa the policeman on trial not rodney king erm surely it irrelevant who on trial jury be suppose to represent a cross-section of the population are they or be they suppose to reflect the population of the locale where the trial be hold normally thi be where the crime be commit unles one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue be in order i not an expert on californium law or even u law but it seem that thi be the way the system be set up you can criticize the system but let not have unfounded allegation of racial prejudice throw around and under american law they deserve a jury of their peer you be say that black person be not the peer of white person no not at all the point be that the fact that there be no black on the first jury and that rodney king be black be totally irrelevant thi point of allegedly racial motivation be really shallow thi idea of person only be try before a jury of person just like them be really stupid should the nuremburg trial have have a jury entirely make up of nazi german perhap peer do mean those who do the same thing like have murderer judge murderer it mean have person from the same station in life presumably because they be in a better position to understand the defendent motivation s those who have be foam at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have look no further than the video tape but the jury look at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not see when i see a bunch of policeman beat someone who lie defenceles on the grind it rather hard to imagine what thi other evidence might have be so it hard to imagine so when ha argument from incredulity gain acceptance from the revere author of constructing a logical argument we not talk about a logical argument we talk about a court of law a the faq point out some fallaciou argument be not view a fallacy in a court of law ok grant however you be use thi reason a part of ymy logical argument in thi discussion thi be not a court of law if the fact a the news commentator present them be true then i feel the not guilty verdict wa a reasonable one were you not talk earlier about the bia of the liberal medium conspiracy the medium be not totally monolithic even though there be a prevail liberal bia program such a the macneil-lehrer news hmy try to give a balance and fair report of the news there be even conservative source out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush btw i never use the word conspiracy i do accept without far more evidence theory that there be some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempt to take over all news source thou shalt not kill unles thou hast a pretty good reason for kill in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who get in the way a unfortunately it can not be help jim brown bible for loving christian thank mathew i like the quote pretty funny actually i a monty python fan you know kind of seem in that vein of course oversimplify any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already ha ha only seriou i an atheist be argue against kill innocent person you a suppose christian be argue that it ok to kill innocent person so long a you get some guilty one a well hardly i do say that it a good thing tm to kill innocent person if the end be just unfortunately we do live in a perfect world and there be no perfect solution if one be go to resist tyranny then innocent person on both side be go to suffer and die i do say it be ok it be unfortunate but sometime necessary i a moral relativist be argue that saturation bomb of german city at the end of world war ius wa a far a i can see an evil and unnecessary act i would agree that it wa evil in the sense that it cause much pain and suffer i not so sure that it wa unnecessary a you say that conclusion can only be arrive at by evaluate all the factor involve and perhap it wa unnecessary a let say we now know that do mean that those who have to make the decision to bomb do see it a be necessary rarely can one have full know of the consequence of an action before make a decision at the time it may have seem necessary enough to go ahead with it but do assume that i feel the bomb wa morally justify i do i just do condemn those who have to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstance you have criticise moral relativism in the past be now argue that i be in no position to judge the morality of ally action at the end of the war you certainly be not in such a position if you be a moral relativist i a an absolutist be in a position to judge but i defer judgment you be argue that the action need to be assess in the particular context of the time and that they might have be moral then but not moral now wrong they be neither moral then nor now they seem necessary to those make the decision to bring a quick end to the war i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision where ymy christian love where ymy absolute morality oh how quick you be to discard them when it suit you a ivan stang would say jesu would puke one day i will stand before jesu and give account of every word and action even thi discourse in thi forum i understand the full ramification of that and i be prepare to do so i do believe that you can make the same claim mathew and btw the reason i bring up the blanket-bombing in germany wa because you be bemoan the iraqi civilian casualty a be so deplorable yet blanket bomb wa institute because bomb wa accurate enough to hit target in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bomb wa the norm so the point wa why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualty that result in spite of precision bomb when so many more civilian proportionately and quantitatively die under the blanket bomb in even with precision bomb mistake happen and some civilian suffer but le civilian suffer in thi war than any other iany other in history many iraqi civilian go about their life with minimal interference from the ally air raid the story of hundred of thousand of iraqi civilian dead be just plain bunk ye bunk the u lose serviceman in over fmy year and the majority of them be directly involve in fight but we be expect to swallow that hundred of thousand of civilian iraqi die in a war last about month and with the ally use the most precise bomb ever create at that what hogwash if hundred of thousand of iraqi civilian die it wa due to action hussein take on hi own person not due to the allied bomb regard jim b
