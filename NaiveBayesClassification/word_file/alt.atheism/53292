from jbrown subject re death penalty gulf war in article mathew mathew write jbrown write in article mathew mathew write ye fortunately we have right-thinking folk like ymy good self in power and it wa therefore deem acceptable to slaughter ten or even hundred o thousand of iraqi in order to liberate we win the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi death be way over-exaggerated and exploit for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news medium the fact be that le iraqi die in the gulf war than do civilian in any other war of comparable size thi century let analyze thi claim a little how be the size of a war define by number of participant geographical area number of country involve number of casualty size of army duration number of casualty both absolute and a a percentage of those involve geographical area and number of country too be all measure of size in thi case i say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatant total troop compare to total casualty from among the total civilian population in the affect geographical area which other comparable war be we talk about vietnam and korea might make good comparison which liberal news medium be we talk about western news in general but in particular the american ma medium cb nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war wa one of those poor poor iraqi along with look how precisely thi cruise missile blow thi build to bite thi wa due mostly to the short duration couple with precise surgical bomb technique which be technically possible only recently i suspect that medical advance may have something to do with it too i agree how about all the innocent person who die in blanket-bombing in i do hear you bemoan them perhap because the topic ha crop up if you want my opinion i think that the blanket bomb of german city at the end of world war two wa the most appal act of wholesale slaughter thi country ha commit in century bomber harri wa no hero of mine perhap so and maybe the atomic bomb wa a mistake too but that easy to say from my enlighten viewpoint here in the right back then it wa all-out war and germany and japan have to be squash after all a million or more british have already die hundred of thousand of french a couple hundread thousand or so american and million of russian not to mention a few million jew pole and other person of slavic descent in german concentration camp all thing consider the fire-bombing and the atomic bomb be essential and therefore justify in bring the war to a quick end to avoid even greater ally loss i for one do regret it war be never an exact science but with smart bomb it become more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualty sometime mistake be make target be misidentified innocent die that war the way it really be entrenched political ruler operate in their own selfish interest without regard for the life of other person that be the way war really be sure and it the person who suffer because of them all the more reason to depose these entrench political ruler operate in their own selfish interest or do you mean that thi apply to the ally a well why all the fus about kuwait and not east timor bosnium or even tibet if iraq be so bad why be we still sell them stuff a couple of week before we start bomb i make no claim or effort to justify the misguide foreign policy of the west before the war it be evident that the west especially america misjudge hussein drastically but once hussein invade kuwait and threaten to militarily corner a significant portion of the world oil supply he have to be stop sure the war could have be prevent by judiciou and concert effort on the part of the west before hussein invade kuwait but it be still hussein who be responsible for hi decision to invade and once he do so a strong response from the west wa require mathew ymy sarcasm be note but you be completely off-base here you come off sound like a complete peace-nik idiot although i feel sure that wa not ymy intent what ymy intent to sound like a loving christian well you be do a very good job of it well it not very love to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby country and keep them or to allow them to continue with ma slaughter of certain people under their dominion so i have to say ye stop hussein wa the most love thing to do for the most person involve once he set hi mind on military conquest so the iraqi war wa wrong eh i sure that appeasement would have work better than war just like it do in eh who even mention appeasement and what make you think the situation be even remotely analogou to world war two i mention it if we have intervene allow hussein to keep kuwait then it would have be appeasement it be precisely the lesson the world learn in that motivate the western alliance to war letting hitler take austrium and czechoslavkium do not stop from happen and let hussein keep kuwait would not have stop an eventual gulf war to protect saudi arabium i gues we should have fight either just think of all those innocent german civilian kill in dresden and hamburg ye do german be human too you know sure what wa truly unfortunate wa that they follow hitler in hi grandiose quest for a thousand year reich the consequence stem from that tyrant like hussein have to be stop hi kind do understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret be that bush wimped out and do have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein be still in power and the iraqi person sacrifice not to mention the american who die wa for naught i look forward to hear ymy incisive comment about east timor and tibet what should i say about them anything in particular and a for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial bring back a verdict of not guilty ye amongst the thing i think be hmm there an awful lot of white person in that jury so it wa the policeman on trial not rodney king and under american law they deserve a jury of their peer if there have be black officer involve i sure their would have be black juror too thi point of allegedly racial motivation be really shallow those who have be foam at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have look no further than the video tape but the jury look at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not see when i see a bunch of policeman beat someone who lie defenceles on the grind it rather hard to imagine what thi other evidence might have be so it hard to imagine so when ha argument from incredulity gain acceptance from the revere author of constructing a logical argument can we expect another revision soon just kid if there be some wonderful evidence why be it seemingly be keep secret why not tell everyone what it be then everyone could say oh ye you right king deserve a good beat and we could all live happily ever after i have to admit that i wonder thi too but neither the prosecution nor the defense be talk so one can not conclude either way due to the silence of the principal law in thi country be intend to protect the right of the accuse whether they be criminal or cop one be not find guilty if there be a reasonable doubt of one guilt and only the jury be in a position to ass the evidence and render a verdict fine but i still find it hard to imagine what the reasonable doubt wa in thi case i mean the cop certainly seem to be beat someone who lie defenceles on the grind what ymy explanation mas hallucination orbital mind-control laser faked video footage do tell ok it certainly seem to me that there wa excessive force involve and frankly the original not guilty verdict baffle me too but then i learn that the prosecution in the first case do not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have win they try to get a conviction on a charge of aggravate assault with intent to inflict seriou bodily harm a charge which news commentator say wa akin to attempt murder under californium law based on what the prosecution wa ask for it evident that the first jury decide that the officer be not guilty note not not guilty of do wrong but not guilty of aggravate assault with the intent of inflict seriou bodily harm the seed of the prosecution defeat be in their own overconfidence in obtain a verdict such that they go for the most extreme charge they could if the fact a the news commentator present them be true then i feel the not guilty verdict wa a reasonable one mathew thou shalt not kill unles thou hast a pretty good reason for kill in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who get in the way a unfortunately it can not be help jim brown bible for loving christian thank mathew i like the quote pretty funny actually i a monty python fan you know kind of seem in that vein of course oversimplify any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already regard jim b loving christian
