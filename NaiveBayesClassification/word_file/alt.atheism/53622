from frank frank subject re theism and fanatism wa islamic genocide in article benedikt rosenau write in article ook frank frank write theism be strongly correlate with irrational belief in absolute irrational belief in absolute be strongly correlate with fanatism deletion theism be correlate with fanaticism i have neither say that all fanatism be cause by theism nor that all theism lead to fanatism the point be theism increase the chance of become a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatic tend toward theism for example but i just have to loook at the time in history when theism wa the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that be the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidate ymy assumption that theism be the factor to be consider bogu i just say that theism be not the only factor for fanatism the point be that theism be a factor that ymy claim now back it up i consider ymy argument a useful a the follow belief be strongly correlate with fanaticism therefore belief be a factor in fanaticism true and utterly useles note thi be any belief not belief in god tiring to say the least i have back it up read the first statement i have read it conspicuou by it absence be any evidence or point the latter be the fallacy of the wrong analogy saying someone believe something be hardly an information about the person at all saying someone be a theist hold much more information further the correlation between theist and fanatism be higher than that between belief at all and fanatism because of the special feature of theistic belief truth by blatant assertion evidence gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on be all more reliable indicator and the really dangerou person the source of fanaticism be often none of these thing they be cynical manipulator of the gullible who know precisely what they be do that a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leader believe what they say if you believe that you incredibly naive you frank be live in a dream world i wonder if there be any base of discussion leave after such a statement a a matter of fact i think you be ignorant of human nature even when one start with something one do not believe one get easily fool into actually believe what one say to give you the benefit of the doubt prove ymy statement the onu of proof be on you sunshine what make you think that theist leader believe what they say especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely follow by it opposite the practice be not restrict to theism but it there for anyone to see it almost an epidemic in thi country just for instance if it be harder for a camel to pa thru the eye of a needle why be the catholic church such a wealthy land-owner why be there church to the square inch in my country now some brand of theism and more precisely some theist do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theist with thi brush be bigotry not a reason argument and it read to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction of religiou freedom ever read animal farm that a straw man and a usually in discussion with you one ha to repeat it read what i have write above not every theism lead to fanatism and not all fanatism be cause by theism the point be there be a correlation and it come from innate feature of theism no some of it come from feature which some theism ha in common with some fanaticism ymy last statement simply be imply by what you say before because you try to sneak in innate feature of all theism the word you grope for be some bogu again not all theism a be be fanatic however the rest already gife backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and theism and further the specialty of other theistic belief allow them to switch to fanatism easily it take just a nifty improvement in the theology truth by blatant assertion gullibility by the way be one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seem a whole lot more relevant to the case you have a oppose to the case you be try to make because there be more about theism that the attraction to gullible person cause the correlation and the whole discussion start that way by the statement that theism be meaningfully correlate to fanatism which you challenge indeed i do a i recall i ask for evidence what be the correlation of which you speak and to say that i be go to forbid religion be another of ymy straw man interesting that you have nothing better to offer i say it read like a warm up to that that because it an irrational and bogu tirade and ha no other use than create a nice split in the mind of excitable person such a be to be find on either side of church wall blah blah blah i be quite well aware that give everyone their right protect me better from fanatic than the other way round of course other person be alway fanatic never oneself ymy wish to slur all theist seem pretty fanatical to me it be quite nice to see that you be actually imply a connection between that argument and the rise of fanatism so far it be just another of ymy assertion so you can do it define irrational belief be it rational to believe that reason be alway useful irrational belief be belief that be not base upon reason the latter ha be discuss for a long time with charley wingate one point be that the belief violate reason often and another that a proces that do not lend itself to rational analysi do not contain reliable information well there be a glare paradox here an argument that reason be useful base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would be irrational which be it that bogu self reference be not circular and since the evaluation of usefulnes be possible within rational system it be allow it oval it still beg the question however and though that certainly be allow it not rational and you claim to be rational and all another of ymy assertion no proof no evidence just claim hey i learn it from you did i do good at the risk of repeat myself and hear we have that before we do hear a refutation before so we back deal with it you ca use reason to demonstrate that reason be useful someone who think reason be crap wo buy it you see that be unusually weak even for you the latter imply that my proof depend on their opinion somehow who do not accept that there be triangle wo accept pythagora wow that an incredible insight i do have to prove them wrong in their opinion it be possible to show that their system leave out useful information respectively claim unreliable or even absurd statement to be information totally circular and totally useles their wish to believe make them believe thing be judge by their appeal and not by their information it make you feel good when you believe that may be good for them but it contain zillion of possible pitfall from belief despite contrary evidence to the bogu proof they attempt truth by blatant assertion i see a many bogu proof of the non-existence of god a i have of their existence rational system by the way do not mean that every datum ha to come from logical analysi the point be that the evaluation of the datum do not contradict logic it easily follow that such a system do not allow to evaluate if it rational in itself ye it be possible to evaluate that it be rational in a system that be not rational by the fallacy of that system but since the validity of the axiom be agree upon that ha a little impact a the possibility of a demon ala descarte thi just do parse sorry so far it just a matter of consistency i use ratiional argument to show that my system be consistent or that their be the evaluation of the nor thi prediction do not need rationality it do not contradict however ymy argument be a silly a prove mathematical statement need mathematics and mathematics be therfore circular anybody else think godel wa silly stream of consciousnes type what be that suppose to mean the first part of the second statement contain no information because you do say what the belief be if the belief be strong theism strong atheism then ymy statement be not in general true the second part of ymy sentence be patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum do not lend itself to rational analysi but be assume to contain reliable information regardles of what proces be use to obtain it i be speak of religiou system with contradictory definition of god here an axiomatic datum lend itself to rational analysi what you say here be a an often refute fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axiom in larger system out of which they be usually derive i exist be derive if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axiom what be it you be try to say that at some point person alway wind up say thi datum be reliable for no particular reason at all example i be not dream nope there be evidence for it the trick be that the choice of an axiomatic basi of a system be difficult because the possibility be interweave one therefore choose that with the least assumption or with assumption that be necessary to get information out of the system anyway i like to see thi allege evidence one do not need to define axiom in order to define an evaluation method for usefulnes the foundation be lay by how one feel at all that not how one feel about it i see you have no irrational belief but then fanatic never do do they compared the evidence theist have for their claim to the strength of their demand make the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i ca agree with thi until you be specific which theism to say that all theism be necessarily antirational require a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of god personal supernatural entity with objective effect on thi world usually connect to moral the way the world work imo any belief about such god be necessarily irrational that do not mean that person who hold them be in principle oppose to the exercise of intelligence some atheist be also scientist for example they do use theism when do science or it would be science please note that subjective datum lend themself to a scientific treatment a well they just prohibit formulate them a objective statement ergo nothing be objective fair enough the affinity to fanatism be easily see it ha to be true because i believe it be nothing more than a work hypothesi however the belief say they be more than a work hypothesi i do understand thi can you formalise ymy argument person a believe system b becuase it sound so nice that do not make b true it be at best a work hypothesi however the content of b be that it be true and that it be more than a work hypothesi testing or evaluate evidence for or against it therefore dismiss because b already believe say it be wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further content of b be to be kill thi can have interest effect peculiar definition of interest but sure now show that a belief in god entail the further content of which you speak why be my catholic neighbour out kill the protestant for example maybe they do believe in it maybe it the conjunction of b assert b and dissenter that be important and the belief in god be entirely irrelevant it certainly seem so to me but then i have no axe to grind here the example with ymy neighbour be a fallacy that ymy neighbour do say little about other and there be time when exactly that happen nope it not a fallacy it just do go to the correlation you wish to see and tell me when it be not irrelevant why be such statement about amalekite and idolater in the holy book please note that one could edit them out when they be not relevant anymore because god do err what do that say about that message excuse me the holy book and how come we have theist say genocide order by god be ok a god be the easiest way to excuse anything and therefore highly attract to fanatic not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatic can have on the rest of the believer happen again and again and again a god be neither the easiest way to excuse anything nor the only way frank not hatch that odwyer from hen by
