from keith keith allan schneider subject re political atheist bobbe robert beauchaine write but you do know that capital punishment be wrong so it be the same a shoot a better analogy would be that you continue to drive ymy car realize that sooner or later someone be go to be kill in an automobile accident you know person get kill a a result of drive yet you continue to do it anyway uh uh you do not know that you will be the one to do the kill i not sure i drive a car if i have sufficient evidence to conclude that i would necessarily kill someone during my lifetime ye and everyone think a you do no one think that he be go to cause or be involve in a fatal accident but the likelihood be surprisingly high just because you be the man on the fire squad whose gun be shoot blank do not mean that you be le guilty i do know about jon but i say all take of human life be murder and i say murder be wrong in all but one situation when it be the only action that will prevent another murder either of myself or another you mean that kill be wrong in all but one situtation and you should note that that situation will never occur there be alway other option thank kill why do you just say that all kill be wrong thi be basically what you be say i get a bite tire of ymy probabilistic argument are you attempt to be condescend that the system usually work pretty well be small consolation to the poor innocent bastard get the lethal injection is ymy personal value of human life base solely on a statistical approach you sound like an unswerving adherent to the need of the many outweigh the need of the few so fuck the few but most person have find the risk to be acceptable you be probably much more likely to die in a plane crash or even use an electric blender than you be to be execute a an innocent i personally think that the risk be acceptable but in an ideal moral system no such risk be acceptable acceptable be the fudge factor necessary in such an approximation to the ideal keith
