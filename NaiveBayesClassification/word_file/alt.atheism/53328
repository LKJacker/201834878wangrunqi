from perry jim perry subject re is morality constant wa re biblical rape thi response originally fell into a bite bucket i reposting it just so bill do think i ignore him in article bil bill conner write jim perry perry write some stuff about biblical morality though bill quote of me have little to do with what he go on to say bill i sorry to have be busy lately and only just be get around to thi apparently you have some fundamental confusion about atheism i think many of these be well address in the famou faq ymy generalism be then misplace atheism need imply materialism or the lack of an absolute moral system however i do tend to materialism and do believe in absolute morality so i answer ymy question how then can an atheist judge value an atheist judge value in the same way that a theist do accord to a personal understand of morality that i do believe in an absolute one do mean that i do have one i just explicit a in the line of post you follow up that when i expres judgment on a moral issue i be base my judgment on my own code rather than claim that it be in some absolute sense good or bad my moral code be not particular different from that of other around me be they christian muslim or atheist so when i say that i object to genocide i not express anything particularly out of line with what my society hold if ymy be to ask why i think morality exist and ha the form it do my answer would be mechanistic to ymy taste that a moral code be a prerequisite for a function society and that humanity probably evolve morality a we know it a part of the evolution of my ability to exist in large society thereby achieve considerable survival advantage you probably say that god just make the rule neither of u can convince the other but we share a common understand about many moral issue you think you get it from ymy religion i think i get it and you get it from early childhood teach that you do like what god tell person to do say nothing about god or god command it say only that there wa an electrical event in ymy nervou system that create an emotional state that ymy mind couple with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction i think you be read the wrong sort of comic book but in pry through the gobbledygook i basically agree with what you say i do believe that my mental reaction to stimulus such a god command the genocide of the canaanite be mechanistic but of course i think that true of you a well my reaction ha little to do with whether god exist or even with whether i think he do but if a god exist who command genocide i could not consider him good which be supposedly an attribute of god all of thi be so you have exclude yourself from any discussion of value right wrong goood evil etc and can not participate ymy opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever hmm ye i think some heavy faq-reading would do you some good i have a much place discuss value etc a any other person in fact i can actually accomplish something in such a discussion by frame the question in term of reason for instance it be clear that in an environment where neighbor tribe periodically attempt to wipe each other out base on imagine divine command then the quality of life will be generally poor so a system that foster coexistence be superior if quality of life be an agree goal an absolutist on the other hand can only thump those portion of a bible they happen to agree with and say thi be good even if the act in question be unequivocally bad by the standard of everyone in the discussion the attempt to define someone or a group of person a exclude from discussion such that they can not participate and their opinion give no weight whatsoever be the lowest form or reason ad the well and presumably the resort of someone who ca rationally defend their own idea of right wrong and the bible jim perry perry decision support inc matthew nc these be my opinion for a nominal fee they can be your jim perry perry decision support inc matthew nc these be my opinion for a nominal fee they can be your
