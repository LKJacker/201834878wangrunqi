from perry jim perry subject re is morality constant wa re biblical rape thi fray thread ha turn into a patent ping-pong game and i do have any strong disagreement so i try to stick to the one thing i do quite follow about the argument it seem to me that there be a contradiction in argue that the bible wa enlighten for it time closer to what we would consider morally good base on my standard and past experience on the one hand i hope thi summarize thi argument adequately and on the other hand in article strom rob strom write in article perry jim perry write disclaimer i speak from the jewish perspective where the bible mean what many call the old testament and where the interpretation be not necessarily the raw text but instead the court case commentary and tradition pass down through jewish community thi seem the crux to me if you judge the bible accord to a long line of tradition and interpretation come down to the current day rather than on it own merit a a cultural artifact then of course it will correspond more closely with more contemporary value but if that how the bible be actually be use today should that be how we should judge it if most person use scissor to cut paper should consumer report test scissor for paper-cutting ability even though scissor may have be design originally to cut cloth that possibly a good way to judge the use of the bible in teach jewish morality today but it hardly seem fair to claim that thi highly-interpreted version be what wa enlighten for it time to attempt to extend the analogy thi be like say that the original scissor-maker be unusually advance at paper-cutting for their time even though they only ever cut cloth and have never even hear of paper i not argue that the bible be disgust though some of the history depict in it be by modern standard however history be full of similar bus and i do think the biblical account be worse than their contemporary or possibly our on the other hand i do know of any reason to think the history describe in the bible show le abuse than their contemporary or our that complex and benign moral tradition have evolve base on particular mythic interpretation of that history be interest but i still do think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history jim perry perry decision support inc matthew nc these be my opinion for a nominal fee they can be your
