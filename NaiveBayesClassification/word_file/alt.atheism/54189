from john a johnson subject re after year can we say that christian morality be in article itp frank frank say specifically i like to know what relativism conclude when two person grotesquely disagree is it a both be right b one of them be wrong and sometime though perhap rarely we have a pretty good idea who it be c one of them be wrong but we never have any information a to who so we make my best gues if we really must make a decision d the idea of a right moral judgement be meaningles imply that whether peace be better than war be a meaningles question and need not be discuss for it ha no correct answer e something else a short positive assertion would be nice a i hope you can tell b and c be actually predicate on the assumption that value be real so statement like these consistently derive from the relativist assumption that value be part of objective reality i be a relativist who would like to answer ymy question but the way you phrase the question make it unanswerable the concept of right and wrong or or belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral question it make no sense to ask if a moral position be right or wrong although it be legitimate to ask if it be good or better than another position let me illustrate thi point by look at the psychological derivative of epistemology and ethic perception and motivation respectively one can certainly ask if a percept be right correct true veridical or wrong incorrect false illusory but it make little sense to ask if a motive be true or false on the other hand it be strange to ask whether a percept be morally good or evil but one can certainly ask that question about motive therefore ymy suggest answer a c simply ca be consider they assume you can judge the correctnes of a moral judgment now the problem with d be that it be double-barrelled i agree with the first part that the rightnes of a moral position be a meaningles question for the reason state above but that be irrelevant to the allege implication not an implication at all that one can not feel peace be better than war i certainly can make value judgment bad better best without assert the correctnes of the position sorry for the lengthy dismissal of a d my short e answer be that when two individual grotesquely disagree on a moral issue neither be right correct or wrong incorrect they simply hold different moral value feel john a johnson department of psychology penn state duboi campu penn state be not responsible for my behavior a ruthles doctrinaire avoidance of degeneracy be a degeneracy of another sort getting drink and pick up bar-lady and write metaphysic be a part of life from lila by r pirsig
