from acooper turin turambar me department of utter misery subject re faith and dogma in article tgk todd kelley write in light of what happen in waco i need to get something of my chest sadly understandable faith and dogma be dangerou ye religion inherently encourage the implementation of faith and dogma and for that reason i scorn religion to be fair you should really qualify thi a semitic-western religion but you basically go ahead and do thi later on anyway i have express thi notion in the past some christian debate with me whether christianity leaf any room for reason i claim rationality be quell out of christianity by faith and dogma again thi should really be evaluate at a personal level for example there wa only one jesu presumably and he probably do say all that many thing and yet seemingly billion and billion of christian sect have arise perhap there be one that be totally dedicate to rationalism and believe in christ a in pantheism it would seem to go against the bible but it be amaze what person come up with under the guise of personal interpretation a philosopher can not be a christian because a philosopher can change hi mind wherea a christian can not due to the nature of faith and dogma present in any religion thi be a good point we have here the quintessential christian he set up a system of for himself which work very well and every be understandable and deablable within the framework of thi system however we also have an individual who ha the inability at least not without some difficulty to change which be important because the problem with such a system be the same a with any system one can not be open mind to the point of test hypothesis against the basic premise of the system without destroy whatever faith be invest therein unles of course all the test fail in other word the fairer way would be to test and evaluate morality without the of a system i claim that a christian philosopher be not a christian but be a person whose belief at the moment correspond with those of christianity consider that a person visit or guard a prison be not a prisoner unles you define a prisoner simply to be someone in a prison can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment be in a prison can we define a christian to be someone who at the moment ha christian belief no because if a person be free to go he be not a prisoner similarly if a person be not constrain by faith and dogma he be not a christian interesting but again when it seem to basically boil down to individual nuance although not alway i will admit and probably it be the mass-oriented division which be the most appal it become irrelevant unfortunately i admit it a word game i go by the dictionary definition of religion religion n concern over what exist beyond the visible world differentiate from philosophy in that it operate through faith or intuition rather than reason webster now let go beyond the word game i do claim that religion cause genocide i think that if all human be atheist there would still be genocide there will alway be human who do think there will alway be human who do ask themself what be the real difference between themself and person with different color skin or a different language or different belief granted religion be like the gun that do kill anybody religion encourage faith and dogma and although it do directly condemn person it encourage the use of just because think it be just because think that kill person in which case the person become the bullet and the religion a the gun merely offer them a way to more adequately do some harm with themself if i may be so bold a to extend ymy similie sure religion ha many good quality it encourage benevolence and philanthropy ok so take out only the bad thing like faith dogma and tradition put in the good thing like careful reason and science the result be secular humanism would it be nice if everyone be a secular humanist to please the supernaturalist you might even leave god in there but the secular emphasi would cause the supernaturalist to start think and they too would realize that a belief in a god really do put anyone further ahead in understand the universe ok i just poke fun at the supernaturalist also understandable of course not all human be capable of think and we still have genocide and maybe even some ma suicide but not a much i will to bet on that todd todd kelley tgk department of computer science university of toronto best regard adam john cooper verily often have i laugh at the weakling who think themself good simply because acooper they have no claw
