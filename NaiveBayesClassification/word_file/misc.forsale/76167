from mrh michael r hartman subject re car stereo stolen in article xray kenneth dwayne ray write i have the front panel of my car stereo steal thi weekend i need to buy the front panel of a sony car stereo i wa my understand that the purpose of those removeable-front-panel be to make the radio useles and thu discourage theft that be if the cover be remove by the owner and take along whenever the car wa leave if those cover be sell for anything remarkably le than the radio originally cost or even sell at all then the above discouragement would be so great i personally would be unhappy if i buy a radio like that think that remove the cover greatly depreciate the radio value and the cover be sell by the company or other legitimate source cheaply the front cover should be available from sony check with a local car stereo shop you will probably definitely have to provide the unit serial number and hopefully you have register the warranty card i do know the cost but replacement have to be available to person who damage the face cover so it stand to reason that it can be replace a to deter theft when i work for a stereo shop we refer the customer to a sony number we would not sell the face nor do we have them available most person who come in ask for the face cover or a pullout sleave for that matter would look very dishearten to find that they acquire a deck they could use if theft occur with these deck notify sony serial number do catch theife just a think michael
