from pmartz paul martz subject re animation with xputimage in article dcr derek c richardson write hi i new to thi group so please bear with me two year ago i write a sunview application for fast animation of raster file with sunview become rapidly obselete i finally decide to rewrite everything from scratch in xview i put together a quick test and i find that xputimage be considerably slower factor of on average than the sunview command which move image datum from memory pixrect to a canva thi wa on a sparc ipx it seem that the x protocol communication be slow thing down or xputimage be inefficient or both using xputimage ymy source be maintain by the client and the destination be maintain by the server thu you incur the overhead of transport through whatever client-server communication mechanism you be use is it possible for you to maintain ymy source image in pixmap these be maintain by the server so copy them into a window be much cheaper also make sure you be not send any unnecessary xsync or run in xsynchonize mode paul pmartz evan sutherland
