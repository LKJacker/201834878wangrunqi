from stus sami-jaakko tikka subject re find out state of state key eg capslock and numlock in rps ralph seguin write my question be thi is there a mean of determine what the state of capslock numlock be i do know any way except to see what modifier be on in th keypres event of course if there be some reason why you need to alway know the state of modifier even if ymy window do have the keyborad focu you can alway ask for keypres event from the root window then you get all the keypress and you alway know what have be press an even more point question is there an easy mean of make an x keyboard act like a pc keyboard ie capslock be active and the user press shift-a i like to get a lowercase instead of i think thi be just a question of how to implement xlookupstring you can alway write another function that interpret the keypress a you like you can look at the implementation of xlookupstring from the xlib source and then modify it a little bite live long and prosper
