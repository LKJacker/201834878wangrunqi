from dealy brian dealy csc subject re monthly question about xcopyarea and expose event post of the question that just do seem to get answer suppose you have an idle app with a realize and map window that contain xlib graphic a button widget when press will cause a new item to be draw in the window thi action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handle regular expose event window manager-driven exposure take care of render the new image using an expose event handler be a proper way to do thi because at the time the handler be call the xlib window be guarantee to be map the problem of course be that no expose event be generate if the window be already visible and map what we need to do be somehow tickle the window so that the expose handler be hit with argument that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contain the new item what be the best way to tickle a window to produce thi behavior if i understand ymy problem correctly you want to have a way to send exposure to ymy manager widget when ymy app-specific code draw xlib graphic on the window it sound like you might want to send an exposure use xsendevent and specify a region if you know the region you need to send the exposure generally you have the bound rectangle of the object you can use xcreateregion to create a region xunionrectwithregion to add the new object polygon to the region and then either use the region to clip ymy gc for the redraw or use xrectinregion to test which of ymy other object need to be redrawn keeping in mind that the stack order of overlap object affect how they look hope it help brian dealy it not know where it at dealy that important it know uunet dftsrv kong dealy where it not at brian dealy it not know where it at dealy that important it know uunet dftsrv kong dealy where it not at
