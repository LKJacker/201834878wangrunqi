from martinh martin hunt subject announcing tcpview a motif-based protocol analyzer tcpview be the result of several problem we have at uw we have several network general sniffer which be heavily use to help debug problem on several hundred subnet these be good tool but they be heavy hard to find when you need one limit in their software expandibility difficult to use to upload datum for analysi can not be remotely operate and can not resolve name with dn require much manual manipulation of the name table we also sometime use tcpdump but we find it too difficult for most person do not have enough information for many protocol could not be use interactively could not handle tcp stream and could not read sniffer file however tcpdump do do a reasonable job of decode a large number of protocol and could be easily modify tcpview be an attempt to resolve these problem by add a motif interface to tcpdump and expand it feature tcpview ha be test on a decstation and sun under ultrix and suno respectively it should work on the same system a tcpdump it compile with cc and gcc on the dec and sun to build tcpview you will need motif or better the follow file be available for anonymou ftp from in tcpview and tcpdump source code binary dec mip ultrix binary what tcpview add to tcpdump easier interface enhance protocol decode hex display of frame capture base on time number of frame or user interrupt can show ethernet address with manufacturer name ethernet addres host table can easily follow a stream highlight out-of-order frame can send tcp datum to an external file or filter for additional process change to tcpdump new feature now read and write network general sniffer file when use with the file type will be automatically detect can now read in and use an snmp mib file the hex format ha be change new time option have be add option be add to allow view and process of the datum in tcp packet bug be fix in the relative tcp sequence number s flag new flag r read sniffer file not usually need except for read from stdin ttt print deltum time tttt print time relative to the first frame w write a sniffer save file use with w x print frame minu link-level header in hexdump format sample output s win e p d j p n x print tcp datum in hexdump format use with z z write tcp datum to stdout use with t to eliminate timestamp z write frame and tcp datum to stdout martin m hunt martinh network distributed computing university of washington martin hunt martinh network and distributed computing university of washington
