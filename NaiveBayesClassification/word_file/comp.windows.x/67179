from rgooch richard gooch subject re animation with xputimage in article dcr derek c richardson write i just implement thi and it seem i can just about achieve the display rate frame sec on ipx that i get with sunview though it a bite choppy at time also load the datum make an ximage then it into a pixmap be a bite cumbersome so the animation be slower to load than with sunview is there a better way to load in the datum rgooch richard gooch write if you need speed and ymy client can run on the same host a the x server you should use the share memory extension to the sample x server mit-shm xdpyinfo will tell you if ymy server ha thi extension thi be certainly available with the sample mit x server run under suno a word of warn make sure ymy kernel be configure to support share memory and another word of warn openwindow be slower than the mit server i have write an image tool use xview for the gui by the way which yield over frame per second for bite image run on a sparc ipc half the cpu grunt of an ipx thi ha prove quite sufficient for animation regard richard gooch shared memory putimage also mention by nkissebe nick kisseberth look interest but i need someone to point me to some documentation is thi method likely to give better result than server resident pixmap i also be interest in look at the xview code mention above thank for the help so far if i get something decent put together i definitely post it to the net the mit tape come with documentation write by keith packard on the shared memory extension to x look in i find thi invaluble unfortunately there be a bite of work to set up the share memory segment make an ximage from it etc also there be an extension query to determine if the server support it but you still need to test if the server be run on the same host and if share memory be enable in the kernel i have write layer of convience routine which make all thi transparent a for the xview code well i doubt that would be consider interest the interest stuff be do in a c object library person interest in thi code can email me regard richard gooch rgooch
