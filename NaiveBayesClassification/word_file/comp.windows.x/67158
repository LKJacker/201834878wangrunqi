from agallagh gallagher andrea j subject detecting read-only colorcell again poseted for a friend okay i get such great response from my last question thank everyone let try again how can i tell if a colorcell be read-only i want to use any read-only cell that be already in my colormap once i start run out of allocatable cell use some arbitrary nearest color match scheme to get those cell that come closest to a request color once i determine if a cell be read-only i assume i can then just request an xalloccolor with the exact same color specification and it will then be flag a by my application so that it do later get free by someone else and allocate again a read-write to another application so far the only way i figure out to do thi be to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cell color once my colormap be all full up it should error out if the cell be non-shareable but life would be much easier if i could just detect the stuff directly any idea noel ngorelic
