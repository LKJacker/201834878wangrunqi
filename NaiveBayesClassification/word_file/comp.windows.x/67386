from gpatapi george patapi subject re on a pc and network traffic in article support technical support write in article gpatapi write what sort of traffic be generate with the x-call i be curiou to find out the require bandwidth that a link must have if one machine run be support multiple user client and we require adequate response time anyone have any idea i expect the limit factor will be ymy server machine not the network itself to give you a real-world example here at quarterdeck we have roughly person use dvx to talk to a bunch of unix box novell file server and each other it not too much of a load on my ethernet with maybe concentrator so you have person on each segment if you have a badly load net or the app you want to run be very network intensive you could run into some slowdown but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have person run program off it you go to see some slowdown because you now on effectively a mhz of course dvx will attempt to see if task be idle and make sure they give up their time slouse but if you have work program run you know it well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the significant drop in price year after year the link i want to use though isdn be costly and the bandwidth limit that why my interest ly in see if such a link can be use and see what traffic go through it having say that if you can tweak the program be run by add in call to give up time slice when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run person on a give machine before you start see slowdown again thi time from network bandwidth hmmm ha anyone at ymy centre monitor the traffic at all are you run any standard ms-window program like word what sort of packet go blaze through what size link do you have or what be the average traffic flow go through ymy network or do you have few high peak and then many low point it all really depend on what the program be do ie you go to see a slowdown from x-bandwidth a lot sooner if ymy app be all do network thing also what do you mean by network thing i vision use m window and other window application over the network be the process be run on the server and all i be get be the display i be wonder how good be the x and subsequently protocol in transfer these image with x-call and display them on a client machine quarterdeck office system internet support tom bortel info tech question support bb fax compuserve go quarterdeck from touch-tone phone for technote on demand george patapi pan metron ariston telecom lane cove email gpatapi sydney south fax nsw australium voice
