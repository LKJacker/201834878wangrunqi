from daniel brad daniel subject re xv ha escape given that all the source code contain explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice i would say that the shareware notice be unenforceable all you need to do be make minor change to create a derivative work which be explicitly allow under the first part of the copyright notice of course thi would be circumvent the author wish on the subject but i say if you not go to pay him no matter what you be on relatively safe grind with that approach in fact give the internal contradiction of the copyright notice i gues none of it could ever be enforce but not be a lawyer i ca be positive regardles the fee he ask be not excessive and i would encourage anyone who want to use the program to pay them if at all possible even though it be unlikely that you have actual legal obligation to pay the author it would be reasonable to do so to support hi effort if nothing else brad brad daniel if money ca buy happiness daniel i gues i have to rent it i do work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic do speak for my employer
