from operator me subject vanishing font problem a colleague ha a bizarre font problem on hi new mip workstation when he first log on vium xdm he ha a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager run in thi configuration x window application particularly xdvus work fine however if he open up a second xterm application suddenly xdvus can not start in either window give the error unable to load iso font the only difference between the two xterm window be that the initial one reference a different name in the xsession file with prettier colour and other slight change further investigation show that only open a default xterm cause thi behavimy and more significant all x application can no longer load any font if they be invoke from the command line in either window if i start the xterm with a different font use the fn option no problem it would seem that the default xterm be load a font which somehow cause the server to lose all of it font note xlsfont in either window show all of the font available so there do appear to be a problem in the font other than rewrite the xterm app-default file to use a different font and hope for the best do anyone have any idea more info thi be the most recent mip workstation i believe with the most current operate system and run it be not mwm fault a the same problem occur under twm etc
