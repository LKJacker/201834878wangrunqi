from lee liam r e quin subject open look gui frequently ask question frequently-asked question about the open look graphical user interface if ymy question be here please try at least man openwin man xnews man xview and look in the appropriate manual list in the bibliography below before post to the or newsgroup their correspond mail list special note i have not update thi faq for the recently-announced openwindow due to ship later thi year ye sun be move to motif along with all of cose but the motif to which they move will be a new motif with some of the open look ui feature add ye openwindow will use dp instead of news news be dead thi mean tnt be dead too xview and olit will be support but probably not enhance after the next release i do know if there will be a source release of xview or not the cose environment will include at least some of sun deskset port to motif look for calendar manager and mailtool at least ye the new mailtool will be mime-compliant

bibliography book manual journal paper beer-mat subject getting thi file revision history recent change subject terminology open look openwindow xview olit moolit motif what be open look open look be a specification of a graphical user interface gui a gui determine the look and feel of a system the shape of window button and scroll-bar how you resize thing how you edit file etc the open look gui be specify develop and maintain jointly by sun microsystem and at t or usl see also bibliography what be openwindow openwindow be a windowing environment that conform to the open look graphical user interface specification it compatible with the window system from mit a well a currently sun news and sunview so you can intermix program write for any of those system it come from sun and also with system v release from certain vendor openwindow be sometime also call openwin or xnews after the program use to start it and the main executable itself respectively it should not be call window or look or openlook a these term be either wrong or apply to something else a commerical openwindow source licence cost about for the server plu about for deskset and another for tooltalk the current version of openwindow for variou platform be suno on sun solari suno on sparc solari suno on sparc see also mixing and openwindow where can i get it what be olit xview and tnt these be all toolkit for programmer to use in develop program that conform to the open look specification see the bibliography for documentation on the individual toolkit here a brief summary olit wa at t open look intrinsic toolkit for the x window system it use a widget set and wa probably the easiest for person who be already programmer to learn you could buy the source from at t although you do get the same version tht sun ship sun include the olit library in openwindow it be also often include in system v release it wa write in c the release of olit in openwindow wa olit olit support pass to usl then a division of at t now own by novell who replace it with moolit note that because of the nature of xt subclassing you will probably want or need olit source in order to develop a large application or anything else that use subclass see the proceed of the x technical conference xview be sun toolkit for write in c xview be similar in programmer interface to sunview there even a shell script to help migrate source code from sunview to xview xview be often say to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you be not familiar with x window the xview toolkit be include in openwindow and full source be available by anonymou ftp from and elsewhere the current version of xview from sun be despite rumour to the contrary some even from within sun the xview toolkit be not about to be drop by sun xview will be include in the next release of openwindow unlike news on the other hand the xview toolkit be not likely to receive a much attention from sun in the future a olit the news toolkit tnt wa an object-oriented program system base on the postscript language and news tnt implement many of the open look interface component require to build the user interface of an application it currently include in openwindow the current version of tnt from sun be release contain some incompatibility with tnt and tnt but sun be commit to support the apus at least until they stop news support some time later thi year and replace it with display postscript wail you might ask what be commit to mean in thi context the answer seem to be that it mean absolutely nothing sun currently assert that it be commit to olit however the c user interface toolkit uit consist of an object-oriented c clas library layer on top of xview and a tool to generate code from devguide gil file the uit also include feature that simplify event management and the use of postscript and color it be say to be compatible with openwindow and and presumably since the release mention that it work on solari uit be not an official sun-supported product but an ongoing project of variou person within sun it can be find on in the mit contrib directory a use binary mode where do motif fit in it do motif be an alternative graphical user interface that be be develop by osf it ha a look and feel reminiscent of microsoft window and the presentation manager there be no non commercial motif toolkit available although the motif source be sell reasonably cheaply by osf although motif be currently available on more platform than openwindow the open look gui be almost certainly use on many more machine simply because sun and have such a large instal base sun volume contain a roadmap for improve motif application by convert them to olit there be also note in the periodic table olit demo what be moolit moolit be a version of olit from at that let user choose between a motif and an open look ui feel at run-time it will be part of system v release contact joanne newbauer jo what about that display postscript thing sun and adobe have agree that sun will include the dp extension to x in the next release of openwindow dp be essentially a badly design hack on top of a slow level postscript interpreter intend to give a very small subset of the functionality of news whilst simultaneously be harder to use a i understand it the only real advantage it ha over news be that the manual be much smaller be generally le complete dp be also available on more kind of machine performance on my be not suitable for interactive work what it will be like on the sparcstation remain to be see note that wherea font be share by both subsystem the dp extension to x do not make type postscript font available to ordinary program it be not like atm on a pc in thi regard there be at least one third-party version which do make font available however subject window manager olwm olvwm what be olwm and olvwm they be window manager a window manager be the part of the x window system that be responsible for decide how to lay out window on the screen and for manage the user interaction with the window olwm be the standard open look window manager it include with all of the openwindow implementation and you can also get the source by ftp since sun donate it olvwm be a version of olwm that manage a virtual desktop hence the v in it name it show a little map on the screen with the currently display area represent by a little rectangle you can move around by drag the rectangle or with the arrow key thi let you run several client application and move the display around from one to the other olvwm wa derive from the openwindow olwm by scott oak you need to have xview to compile it get olvwm from an ftp site such a in the contrib directory there be three patch can i use my favorite window manager with openwindow instead of olwm ye if you use twm for example or mwm you wo be able to use the pin and unpin feature of olwm and you probably wo see the footer some window use to display certain message if you use twm you want to use the function to unpin menu and get rid of program that do have a quit button when not run under olwm for twm put thi in ymy lefttitlebutton target where target be a icon from alternatively try add a menu to each window manage by twm or tvtwm lefttitlebutton menu menu quit for mwm you can double-click on the menu icon on the leave of the title bar to dismis a pop-up window i be tell see the manual page for ymy window manager twm etc subject openwindow terminal and other display can i use olwm and olvwm without openwindow or on an x terminal the openwindow xnews server combine sunview news postscript and thi mean that it can run program compile for any of those system unfortunately it mean that some openwindow program need either news or sunview support and thu wo run on an x terminal thi include pageview in particular you can use olwm or olvwm see above on an x terminal or a non-open window display and most open look client olit or xview one will work perfectly well you may find that you get complaint about font not be find if so see the font section below if you be run the window manager built-in to an ncd terminal you may have problem with input focu set input true in the terminal xdefault file in may or may not help subject configuration file getting start with openwindow what configuration file do i need to know about xinitrc and xsessionrc the first time you run openwindow a xinitrc file will be create in ymy login directory home if it already exist you might have to edit it somewhat it simplest to move it and any other old file you have to another directory and then merge the old and new file if ymy site use xdm you should use xsession instead of xinitrc since xdm do look at ymy xinitrc file openwin-init openwin-menu and openwin-sy these be optional file you can create in ymy home directory depend on which version of olwm or olvwm you use look in normally for these file without the lead and copy any you want to change you may need to edit ymy xinitrc to get them recognize if you be not on an x terminal you will want to run a console window such a cmdtool c shelltool c xterm c or chuck musciano contool program so that system output will be direct there instead of write over ymy screen note that openwin-sy be not execute unles you edit xinitrc xdefault you can put x window resource specification in here in particular it be a good idea to include at least true input true these allow non-icccm-compliant program to receive input even if they forget to ask for it prop the program that run when you select property from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm write ymy choice into xdefault do put comment in xdefault since prop delete them thi be the news user profile file read by openwindow actually xnews on startup thi be document in the news program manual near the back the most useful thing to put here be postscript code to change the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a syntax error in the postscript mean that xnews will either not start up at all or will get break in strange way the news manual gife code that be both incorrect and insufficient warning thing in thi file rarely work on both openwindow and note that the mouse speed be best set in ymy xinitrc with xset m see the man page for xset man xset and xset help for more information here what should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second microsecond and a repeat rate of twenty or so key per second microsecond between repeat for openwindow you have to experiment a bite because the repeattime be the delay between key send and thu do include the time to proces each key which be probably higher on my than on ymy supersparc gtus injection again thi be for openwindow do want the demo see p xxxius of news toolkit reference manual includedemo false def userprofile begin keyrepeatthresh timeval storetimeval def keyrepeattime timeval storetimeval def note and differ greatly end you must also have a file in the same directory like thi news findpackage beginpackage tntcore findpackage beginpackage tnt findpackage beginpackage classrepeatkey pop force to autoload endpackage endpackage endpackage if you change these parameter you can test them without restart the openwindow server like thi psh i welcome to psh i welcome to classinit classrepeatkey send now pres control-d you can also either of these two file and to make the root window be retain so that a postscript draw on the background wo be erase when you move window frambuffer retained true put will do thi note that thi may increase the amount of memory use by the news server xnews dramatically see also trouble shooting it wo let me type trouble shooting is there an easy way to edit xdefault environment variable how can i configure open look for a left-handed mouse and keyboard you can use xmodmap to change the mouse button but be prepare for one or two occasional surprise see also man xview for a list of keybinding you can change at least for xview program with openwindow you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse map and then let sunview handle them the statu return by svenv should tell you whether ymy server be run under sunview or not put thi in ymy xinitrc if eval svenv env then xmodmap e pointer else xmodmap e pointer fi how can i get the screen to go blank when the system be idle run screenblank from if you can it a bore but effective screen saver see man screenblank under solari you need to copy screenblank from an older system a it not supply then add a new file in to make the system run screenblank automatically subject key binding cut and paste how do i cut and paste between xterm and openwindow program to go from xterm to textedit say select the text you want to copy by drag the select mouse button in xterm pres copy in the xterm thi key be or the xview manual get thi wrong move to the textedit window and pres paste or if thi do work see trouble shooting cut and paste to go the other way from textedit to xterm select the text in textedit no need to use copy move to the xterm window and pres adjust the middle mouse button you can also use the and paste button be bore what short-cut be available quick copy within textedit mailtool etc click select to get a text caret where you want the copy text to go pres and hold down the paste or cut button select the text you want to you see that it underline or cross out a appropriate in the jed demo it go grey let go of the paste or cut button the text you underline or cross out appear at the insert caret drag and drop to move a selection select the text you want to copy or move by drag or multiple click the select or adjust mouse button put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection pres and hold down down the select mouse button and move the mouse pointer a little to the right you see the cursor change to be the first letter of the text or some other icon still hold select down move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text you may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target to show that it ok to drop thing here let go of select and the text be move thi work in text field of dialogue box a well a in text subwindow drag and drop to copy a selection thi be the same a use drag and drop to move a selection except that you must hold the control key down a well a the select mouse button what be the default key bind in textedit and elsewhere see the man page for textedit for some of them in general the command go in the opposite direction when shift delete a word and delete the word to the right of the insert point meta-i include file meta-f find selection ctrl-a start of line ctrl back word ctrl-e end of line ctrl forward word ctrl-w delete word ctrl-u delete to of line ctrl-return move to of document see the xview reference manual for a list of some of the default key see also the olwm or olvwm manual page what can i put in my ttysrc where be it document see the manual page for shelltool subject application finding out contact sunsoft or sun and ask for the catalyst open look guide which list over page of application and also the huge catalyst list of product for sun update six-monthly sun free cdware each contain demo version of several popular open look application often you can simply contact the vendor concern to have the license upgrade from demo and receive the full product documentation sunpic produce a for newsprint user printer pallate which contain newsprint driver for a variety of printer and plotter a well a scaleable font that you can license there be a separate faq post in that list a number of free and commercial aplication mail lee for a copy include open look ui application list in the subject for a faster reply subject deskset mailtool calendar manager etc is there a tty-based interface to cm calendar manager ye and these all have manual page if man do work or gife strange message see under trouble shooting strange error message below how can i arrange to have my signature include in my outgo mail the best way be cd cp chmod w textswrc edit textswrc use vus textedit or whatever you prefer add the follwing filter cat signature you might need to change to home now press will insert ymy signature file subject font do openwindow support type postscript font ye under either solari or i not sure which or not yet in other word if you have framemaker there be a utility to import them i tell the font supply with openwindow be fully hint though and compare them to the microsoft window and apple truetype font be interest the font format be describe in a publication from the sun openfont group list in the bibliography below documentation on the unbundled version of typescaler be also available from sun openfont you can buy font from sunpic monotype linotype urw and probably other major foundry sunpic newsprint software support type font improving font render time although the sun type renderer typescaler be pretty fast it not a fast a load a bitmap you can pre-generate bitmap font for size that you use a lot and you can also alter and acces the font cache parameter if you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache size psh i welcome to psh will say thi at you currentfontmem type thi line and here whai my server wa use kbyte setfontmem just to check currentfontmem see pp of the news programmer guide you need to say psh i so that the postscript package be load see the psh man page making bitmap font for faster startup mkdir cd makeafb m creating convertfont b char parameter greater than number of character supply l bldfamily bembo encoding latin cat no such file or directory xset fp pwd xset fp rehash if you want the server to see ymy new font directory every time add thi directory to ymy fontpath environment variable in one of ymy start-up file login or profile converting between font format convertfont etc you can also use folio font with an server by convert them to a bitmap bdf format first ymy licence forbid you from use the font on another machine and unles you have newsprint you should use them for print having say all that you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf file that you can compile with bdftosnf or bdftopcf use mftobdf from the seetex distribution to convert tex pk font to bdf format which you can then use with either or oenwindow you can also use der mouse getbdf to get bdf font from a run x display server ftp font at dpus there be any more precisely the variou text font such a lucida typewriter san be available at dpus and in fact be scalable under openwindow the glyph font be bitmap and do scale very well subject trouble shooting strange error message no manual entry for if man do seem to find openwindow command even though you be run openwindow try set the manpath environment variable manpath export manpath or setenv manpath for csh user openwinhome should be on most system window window creation fail to get new fd window base frame not pass parent window in environment can not create base frame proces abort these message all come from sunview program sunview wa an earlier windowing system for sun and wa not network some of the sunview program be still around in and have name that be the same a their openwindow counterpart you almost certainly want to run the program in openwinhome instead set ymy path so that and for openwindow come before bin or they the same or you get the sunview version of mailtool cmdtool shelltool etc memory fault core dump if you get thi from the binder or if binder vanish suddenly get the follow patch binder cetable tooltalk trouble compile xt xmu or olit program if you be use openwindow xt contact ymy local sun office and request the follow patch openwindow libxt jumbo patch openwindow undefined symbol when use share libxmu if you ca install the patch a workaround be to add u u on the link ld or cc o line an alternative be to add assert nodefinition to cflag in ymy makefile or even in subject trouble shooting it wo let me type when i try to type into some program i just get beep or nothing happen it be a good idea to include at least true input true in ymy xdefault file a these allow non-icccm-compliant program to receive input even if they forget to ask for it see the next item for edit xdefault subject trouble shooting cut and paste not work i ca paste from xterm to xview include sun deskset program under openwindow you need to add the follow either to ymy file or to instead override key select-set clipboard n key insert-selection clipboard you must not move the mouse between end the selection and press the paste key under openwindow thi be already in the app-default file so if it be work check that xfilesearchpath be set to t n s and if it be either set it or the above line from into see also environment variable thi version automatically put each xterm selection onto the clipboard ctrl metum insert-selection primary n ctrl metum btnup select-end primary clipboard n keypres insert-selection clipboard note be sure that the n be at the very end of the line there must be no follow space and any or sign show that thi faq file wa alter must also be remove if you be use you may find that add the line key start-extend select-end primary clipboard n keyrelease kill-selection n before the keypres line will make cut work a a cut key if you alter instead you must use what x call a more specific resource name will do i ca paste from xview include sun deskset program to xterm if you do have the sun l key on the leave of ymy keyboard you can use meta-x meta-c and meta-v for cut coy and paste respectively you can change the key by add the follow two line to ymy xdefault file edit a you wish the value show here be the default list of resource be in the manual page for xview and also in the thinnish blue book companion to volume xview reference manual from and also in the olwm and olvwm manual page i alway get the same piece of text when i pres paste remove the file and see if that help see also the next item cut copy and paste do work at all openwindow only oh dear use p xuaww grep xv to check that be run and that either you or root start it depend on whether you start openwindow with openwin or by log in through xdm if not start it if it dy check that there be no before restart it you may need to be root to remove it or you can reboot ymy workstation check that there be space in tmp use df tmp and also see if there be a lot of file there with name like if there be several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it time out quit any deskset tool such a mailtool filemgr and cm calendar start a terminal emulator and remove and and file that be still there it simplest to quit openwin and start it again after do that if cut and paste wa break but if it start work again you can just carry on note that file in tmp not own by you might be in use by another worker comrade so do remove those without check first subject trouble shooting not authorize to use display if you get error message that look like xlib connection to refuse by server xlib internal error during connection authorization check error ca open display try on the machine run openwindow or xhost machine where machine be the computer on which you run the command that fail if you want to let other user run program on the same machine a you use ymy display you will have to type the bizarre-looking xhost hostname or xhost happyboy if happyboy be the name of ymy workstation thi let any user on happyboy acces ymy display with openwindow you can also use xauth and the programmer guide describe how to do thi in chapter p thi be more secure also check the man page for fbtab to stop other user access the framebuffer directly also note that there be a sun patch for openwindow under suno to fix a seriou security problem it be available through ymy local sun answer center a well a through anonymou ftp from system in sun-dist fix patchid filename checksum loadmodule on an x terminal there may be a setup menu that let you change or disable the list of host that can acces the display if you start get thi message after you be log in overnight there might be a cron job that remove the unix socket in tmp that be use to communicate with the server when display do have a hostname before the or be empty have the system administrator change the cron script to skip socket subject trouble shooting other common problem i get console error message on my screen and they do go away sun or if refresh make the message vanish but new one come along later you need to run xterm c from ymy xinitrc or start one up in the background and then choose save workspace from the workspace utility menu better still pick up contool and run that get it from in the contrib directory it will monitor the console and open flash it icon or beep when a message appear it very easy to configure if refresh from the workspace utility menu do make the message go away a sun with a frame buffer ha two screen you can move the mouse off the right-hand by default edge of the screen and onto a whole new but monochrome display call see the man page for openwin i have a shell script that check for thi and if there a do openwin dev dev if you be run or openwindow you might need to add thi to ymy xinitrc or other startup file eval svenv display env olvwm display later release of olwm and olvwm do thi automatically you can also run switcher e to get rid of the message also see the note about contool above is there an easy way of edit xdefault use prop which appear in the default root menu a property thi start prop a property editor which will re-write ymy xdefault after remove comment it then apply any change keep comment by use comment instead of for example comment font how do i get the file manager to use emac instead of textedit set the default editor to sh c exec emac font file you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one how do i run openwindow in inverse video thi tend not to work under openwindow with opwnwindow there be variou way include use bg and fg option if you use openwindow on a sun probably the best you can do short of upgrade the workstation to a sparc be to use xterm instead of cmdtool why do flat check-box work a know bug may make guide output dump core if you use these a workaround be to edit the guide output a it only guide output that break not the actual check-box code thi apply only to version of devguide before devguide if you still use an ancient devguide you should upgrade a soon a possible the new one be fantastic when i leave openwindow my screen go blank or my mouse cursor stay on the screen try run if thi help put it a the last line in the shell script you use to start openwindow openwin when i use snapshot the system crash or the server hang or something thi wa a bug relate to some system only the only work-round wa to use some other screen dump program such a xwd xv or xgrabsc why have some of my function key stop work key and change from and to and respectively in openwindow application must be recompiled or you might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycap program to change ymy keyboard layout back again when i type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit i get the sunview version see under trouble shooting strange error message below see also next item mixing and openwindow see also next item note that openwindow include the core distribution to patch level but not the contrib directory these note apply to openwindow although you could also the do same sort of thing with openwindow and install the library in you can intermix openwindow and or they all compatible in thi respect put the binary in for example put last in ymy path so that you get openwindow version of program instead of one where appropriate although thi be a matter of preference in any event put the openwindow bin directory first see the precede item for more detail on that if you have bin or they the same directory on suno earlier in ymy path than you get sunview program instead of openwindow one set so that be last after the library directory thi do matter with openwindow but with older version you get error message from program if you do do thi the message be generally harmles see next item although xdm core dump if thi be right set openwinhome to the directory contain openwindow if it be see also environment variable especially xfilesearchpath i get error message on my screen about not find set to be if you also use use if you put thi in a shell script or ymy profile use lib instead of thi be for for csh it be different i launch my filemgr and i get map heap error at ymy system need to be patch look in and install the patch why do answerbook run for me you must be run openwindow to use answerbook it wo run under on an x terminal or on anything else because it use news to draw the postscript text and picture if you be use openwindow you need to use the openwindow compatible navigator it call on the answerbook if all answerbook user be use openwindow you can replace navigator wih altogether rename the old one first to satisfy ymy sense of paranoium the binary be also on vol note that the datum file be in postscript so you can look at them with a postsript viewer why be there any fish in realxfishdb a fix version of realxfishdb be available by ftp from a why be the property choice disable in the window menu it be implement yet many program do respond to the property key though or have a pop-up menu with property on it file completion in the c-shell be break in cmdtool sadly true but use shelltool or xterm instead and it fine it also work if you run command tool on a remote machine fixed in openwindow ship with solari when i run olit program some of the widget be red release of olit add mouseles operation action widget can be select vium the keyboard the currently select item be highlight in red the red stain to show that it ha the input focu to disable it in most place add thi to ymy file traversalon off on on you can change the color use for example inputfocuscolor green ymy background color see the man page resource at the start of the olit widget set reference manual include in the openwindow programmer documentation meanwhile contact ymy distributor and ask for patch id the cte jumbo patch when i run several program the color on the screen all change when i move into a different window colormap flash thi be becasue most hardware can only display a few color at a time however you can minimise the effect with the follow procedure start all the application with color that you wish to reserve run save to create the owcolor file put the line init near the start of ymy start-up file xinitrc exit and then restart the window system init will push those color owcolor to the end of the colormap and reserve them also note that lock the color of the current window and unlock them thi be describe in the olwm manual page pageiew use the wrong color or make the colormap flash see above thi problem wa report by person for some reason run the motif window manager mwm with openwindow try run pageview like thi svmono discard xdm break thing command tool do like be run without a unix control terminal use to start ymy command tool and all will be well sunview application may need to be run with svenv a in svenv exec because xdm wo set the necessary environment variable note that the mit xdm start up the x server a root which be a security hole for openwindow use the openwindow xdm or be aware that ymy user can acces file and start unix process a root function key and stop work in openwindow the name keysym for these key wa change to and code which use them should be recompiled or you might be able to get away with xmodmap e subject trouble shooting xview problem thi section be here only until an xview faq appear which ha be promise but ha reach here note that there be also a usenet newsgroup although it do sem to have very wide distribution and ha triffic of the order of one or two article per month you should also look at the faq in how do i set the font of individual scrolling list item take an int and an take a null terminate list of there be no easy way to make an entire list fix width font you have to make sure that you alway specify when you insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function list row string that hide the nasty bite how do i keep an xview pop-up window display after a button be press in the button callback do button null thi will keep the window visible you might also need to investigate the attribute how do i make an xview button look press call and these be document in er the xview source openwindow imake do work properly here be greg earle patch to be apply in openwinhome note that you should edit afterward to get osname and osminorversion right minorversion be in suno for example i have edit the patch a little so any bug be mine lee wed sep tue aug elif n openwinhome then arg duseinstalled else elif n openwinhome then arg i duseinstalled dxcomm else wed sep tue aug define bindir openwinhome bin define libdir openwinhome lib define incroot openwinhome define installnonexecfile file dest install file install c instdatflag file dest define nullparameter note the patch be new but i have not mark each line with a liam subject environment variable environment variable and plausible value to use thi list do take into account any local change that you might have make of course thi list be for openwindow difference for openwindow be mark and i add some comment for user of and too display the name of the x window display to use on the local machine the one actually run or xnews on some machine for a second monochrome screen on other machine you may need to do xhost other-machine to let program on other machine use ymy display see also under trouble shooting and see the section on xauth in the openwindow version programmer guide pp see also console message under trouble shooting fontpath where xnews search for font you can also use xset fp dir to add a directory to the font path but you may have to do xset fp rehash afterward thi be fine under openwindow but many server have font problem helppath where xview look when you pres the help key or on suno or with openwindow omit the first entry which be for site use a local other than c or usa where to look to find share c library arch the arch lib entry be only need if you use c program openwinhome where openwindow life keyboard mouse serial device to use instead of the console do set these for normal use and path where the shell search for program to run openwinhome bin openwinhome arch you will certainly want to change thi example there be no openwinhome in openwindow xfilesearchpath where program look for app-default file t n s thi be set automatically by openwin in openwindow you might want to use t n s or perhap both separate with a for example for sh user xfilesearchpath t n s t n s export xfilesearchpath if you use you might
