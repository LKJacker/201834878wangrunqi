provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership require to make thi work membership in the consortium open to any organization there be two category of membership member for large organization and affiliate for smaller organization most of the consortium activity take place vium electronic mail with meet when require a design and specification take shape interest group be form from expert in the participate organization typically a small multi-organization architecture team lead the design with other act a close observer and reviewer once a complete specification be produce it may be submit for formal technical review by the consortium a a propose standard the standard proces typically include public review outside the consortium and a demonstration of proof of

graphical user interface gui open look wa develop by sun with help from at t and many industry reviewer motif wa develop by the open software foundation osf with input from many osf member open look be primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide there be several toolkit which can be use to produce open look application motif include an apus specification the only sanction motif toolkit be the one from osf however there be other toolkit which can be use to produce program which look and behave like one of these parcplace formerly solbourne ous be a virtual toolkit which provide object in the style of open look and motif at the user choice open look gui be also the name of a product from at t comprise their open look intrinsic toolkit and a variety of application thank to ian darwin ian subject just what be openwindow open window be a sun product that encompass a window system that combine a news and server a user-interface specification open look and a series of toolkit that implement it include the sunview-like xview and the xt-based olit xlib and xt implementation and a number of utility olwm window manager filemgr shelltool etc thank to frank greco fgreco subject just what be decwindow decwindow be a dec product that encompass an server the xui toolkit include the dwt widget set and uil xlib and xt implementation a session manager and a number of utility dxwm window manager dxcalendar dxpsview etc at some point motif flavor of the toolkit and application will be ship subject what be pex pex be the phig extension to x phig stand for programmer hierarchical interactive graphic system and be essentially a library of function that simplify the creation and manipulation of graphic many platform be capable of perform in hardware the computation involve in render object the extension allow the client phig in thi case to take advantage of the specialize hardware for graphic sun microsystem be currently contract to develop a freely redistributable copyright similar to the current x copyright sample implementation source and documentation be available in the release several vendor be currently sell independently-developed pex server for their workstation and x terminal last modify subject what be low-bandwidth x lbx xremote ppp slip cslip there be several option for use x over serial line slip serial line ip thi be both a mechanism and a protocol for send ip packet over point-to-point serial link it ha be around for several year and implementation be available for many of the major implementation most x terminal vendor supply thi a a checkoff item although nobody really ever use it since it be horribly slow the header add byte per packet and the encode of the x protocol be rather verbose rightfully so it be optimize for pack and unpack over high-speed link cslip compressed header slip thi be a variant of slip that compress the byte of header down to about or byte it still do do anything about reencoding the x protocol modem that do compression can help but they increase packet latency it take time to dribble the uncompress datum through typical serial interface plu the compression assembly time ppp point-to-point protocol thi be an emerge standard for point-to-point link over serial line that ha a more complete set of option negotiation than slip a grow number of person see the combination of ppp for the serial line management and cslip for the header compression a become common for run normal protocol over serial line running raw x over the wire still need compression somewhere to make it usable xremote thi be the name of both a protocol and set of product originally develop by ncd for squeeze the x protocol over serial line in addition to use a low level transport mechanism similar to xremote remove redundancy in the x protocol by send delta against previou packet and use lzw to compres the entire datum stream thi work be do by either a pseudo-x server or proxy run on the host or in a terminal server there be several advantage to do compression outside the modem you do have to have compress modem in there if you would otherwise be use them if you be go to be directly connect and it reduce the overhead by cut down on the number of byte that have to cro the serial interface and in addition to the effect of it reduce the latency in deliver packet by not require the modem to buffer up the datum wait for block to compres lbx low bandwidth x thi be an x consortium project that be work on a standard for thi area it be be chair by ncd and xerox and be use ncd xremote protocol a a step stone in develop the new protocol lbx will go beyond xremote by add proxy cache of commonly-used information connection setup datum large window property font metric keymap etc and a more efficient encode of the x protocol the hope be to have a standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in additional technical information about how xremote work and a few note on how lbx might be different be available vium anonymou ftp from in contrib in the follow file slide describe xremote more slide describe some of lbx information provide by jim fulton jim there be also a set of slide on export from jim fulton talk at the mit x technical conference subject topic using x in day-to-day life subject what be all these different window manager the window manager in x be just another client it be not part of the x window system although it enjoy special privilege and so there be no single window manager instead there be many which support different way for the user to interact with window and different style of window layout decoration and keyboard and colormap focu in approximate chronological order generally the more recent one be more conformant with the icccm wm thi simple title-bar window manager wa phase out in or uwm the universal window manager be still popular for it speed although it be very outdated moved to contrib on the tape twm old tom window manager wa among the first non-mit window manager and offer the user a great deal of customization option in a re-parenting window manager awm the ardent window manager remain a hotbed for hacker and offer some feature dynamic menu not find on more current window manager cwm cwm be part of the andrew system rtl sieman window manager tile window so that they do overlap and resize the window with the focu to it prefer size dxwm digital dxwm be part of the decwindow offer hpwm hp window manager offer a look it be a precursor of mwm mwm the motif window manager be part of the toolkit tekwm tektronix window manager offer olwm sun olwm implement the open look gui and some of the style guide functionality olwm at t ditto gwm bull generic window manager emulate other with a built-in lisp interpreter version be on the contrib tape be on and the sigma window manager be on the tape pswm sun postscript-based pswm be part of the openwindow release swm solbourne swm be base on the ous toolkit and offer multiple gui support and also a pan virtual window configuration information come from the resource file twm new mit new tab window manager from the tape be a rework twm and be the basi for several derivative include the one on the tape vtwm vtwm offer some of the virtual-desktop feature of swm with a single-root window implementation it be base on the twm and be available on archive server a new version be base on and be available from export tvtwm tom virtual tab window manager be also base on the twm and provide a virtual desktop model on the virtual-root window of swm it be available on archive server olvwm the vtwm-style virtual-desktop add to sun olwm it be available on archive server version be on export mvwm the vtwm-style virtual-desktop add to osf mwm a betum version be float around most recently from suresh but require a source license to ncdwm the window manager local to ncd terminal offer an mwm look xdswm the window manager local to visual technology terminal ctwm claude lecommandeur lecom modification of the twm offer virtual screen in the fashion of hp vuewm source be on export version also offer the window overview use in vtwm and tvtwm vuewm hp mwm-based window manager offer configurable workspace sgi enhance mwm piewm thi version of tvtwm offer pie menu subject why do my x session exit when i kill my window manager sic it need what be probably happen be that you be run ymy window manager a the last job in ymy xsession or xinitrc file ymy x session run only a long a the last job be run and so kill ymy window manager be equivalent to log out instead run the window manager in the background and a the last job instead invoke something safe like exec xterm name login rv iconic or any special client of ymy devise which exit on some user action ymy x session will continue until you explicitly logout of thi window whether or not you kill or restart ymy window manager subject can i save the state of my x session like toolplace do although no know window manager directly support such a feature which may be equivalent to write out a xinitrc or xsession file name the geometry and of each application but olvwm may have something close there be a contribute application which do much of what you be look for although it be not a complete a the sunview program toolplace look for the application xplace on an archive-server near you there be several version of thi program float around look for a recent vintage some new pseudo session-manager such a hp vuewm provide for the save of session include information on the geometry of currently-running application and the resource database bjxrn stabell bjoern subject how do i use another window manager with dec session manager dec session manager will start dxwm up by default to override thi add to ymy xdefault file something like thi line name the full pathname subject how do i change the keyboard auto-repeat rate you can turn auto-repeat on or off by use xset r the x protocol however do provide for vary the auto-repeat rate which be a capability not support by all system some server run on system that support thi however may provide command-line flag to set the rate at start-up time if you have control over server start-up see the man page for xinit and xdm you can invoke the server with the choose set for example you
