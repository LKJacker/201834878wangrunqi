from gdmr george ros subject re xdm and env var in article write i be use xdm on with and on and sparc run suno prior to use xdm i use to set path and other environment variable like manpath helppath arch etc in my login file with xdm the login file do get execute and therefore neither the olwm root-window nor my application know about these variable one usual suggestion be to put everything into ymy every-time shell rc-file instead of ymy login-only one which be fair enough if you only have a few user who know what they do if you have several hundred user who do what the book tell them though then it confuse at best another be to have ymy xterm run login shell but that still leaf the window manager and the thing that get start from it menu with the wrong environment my alternative be that instead of have xdm run the client startup script it run the user favourite shell a a login shell and ha it then run the rest of the startup script that way the user usual environment get set up a normal and inherit by everything you can find an almost-current copy of my script and thing in available from the usual place george d m ros department of computer science university of edinburgh king building mayfield road edinburgh scotland mail gdmr voice fax
