from me michael elbel subject re blinking cursor in xterm in write on frus may gmt me michael elbel say me a be emu wo work on bsd derive system sun with me anything else than a csh there be a fix to thi which be very me short remove one line of code i put thi on export today it more than that actually in the version on export one can not just specify a posix tty behavimy the posix config file be incomplete without those of some specific platform like sun and dec i look twice at port emu to linux but stop short becuse of the tty part is there a cleaner version of emu that support posix tty explicitly hmm depend on how you define jordan implement the system dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementation for call it operate system type then you go ahead and write a include file for ymy specific machine or operate system use the basic implementation since both jordan and i have encounter a o flavor yet that be fully posix we have get around to really implement and test a top-level include file specifically for just posix the posix routine be use in the sun specific file for example but here we also use some bsd stuff all in all it still be probably better to implement a include file for each and every operate system than in exist one the type of me that can result from that can clearly be see in the xterm source even if quite a bite of code get copy almost unchanged a couple of time thi only use up some disk space since only the driver actually include from the toplevel include file will be compile into emu it should be hard to come up with a file that fully rely on the posix stuff but unfortunately i do have a linux system available to me so i ca do the port myself i would suggest you read the readme in and if you have any problem or question contact me and we could try to sort thi out unfortunately we have to rely on help from the net on thi part of emu since we just do have acces to that many different system michael michael elbel digital-pc gmbh muenchen germany me intelligenz be sowieso nur wat fuer doofe mium fermentation fault coor dump
