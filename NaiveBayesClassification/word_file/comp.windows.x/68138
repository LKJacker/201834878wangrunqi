from anthony anthony thyssen subject re automatically configuring display variable ainman andrew dougla inman write do anyone out there know of a way to have a unix machine automatically set it display variable to that of the xterm you use when it not the machine that serve you x the best i be able to come up with ha be a rather convolute script that extract ymy ip from the who command and it frequently fail not to mention that it require have ymy user name add to it andrew inman consultant itd consulting and support service ainman university of michigan from my own note on thi subject method to automatically passwd authorization from one machine to another thi also include the problem of notifing the remote host of the current display that be be use use the method in the xauth manual set up the ymy rhost file in the home directory on the remote machine so that a password in not require to remotly execute command xauth extract display rsh other xauth merge thi method be also use by xrsh to pa authorization my vampire program also use a variation however i wrap it a part of the remote command sequence eg xauth add auth included in thi method be the use of xrlogin and xrsh to do thi job for you these program usally the newer one that be allow you to pa a secified list of environment variable which include the display a copy of the authorization code require the xon program available if enable on sun machine will also pa environment variable a well a the current directory you will however be require to store the authority in such a variable for pass unles you be also have share home directory warning environment variable and command line argument be visible in p list with the appropiate flag a such pass authorization information in environment variable or a argument be not recomended the recommend method a give in the manual show above be safe from the view of other user wrap it a part of the term environment variable thi method use the fact that most remote command executor do pa the term environment variable to the remote host it be then a matter of an appropiate script in ymy remote login file to extract the information from the term environment variable and set up thing appropiatly a version of the xrlogin script be available on the network which do thi basically you change the term environment variable before the actual call to rlogin be perform to include ymy display and ymy authorization on the remote machine you then extract thi information and return the term environment variable to normal before you use it for reset or ymy terminal script for launch rlogin rlogin with display if n display then case display in display hostname display esac term term display xauth nextract display export term fi rlogin add to ymy cshrc or login if term then if echo term tr cd then echo term cut xauth nmerge setenv display echo term cut setenv term echo term cut endif endif xterm command to use xterm t hostname e hostname nf write it to a file on a share nf partition you have acces to note that if the home directory be nf mount then authorization be automatically pass hoever you will still have to pa ymy display environment variable vium a file or other mean ie login host echo display remote host setenv display cat finger for the info in a plan file thi involf encrypt the information into ymy plan or project and have the remote machine finger for the information thi ha the disadvantage of have the information to anyone finger the user thu require a encryption method that be uniq to each individual ie the method of decyrption must not be share or know by other nor should it be easy to determine a improvment be to use the who finger me technique to only give the information only to ymy own remote account and not just to anyone who be ask thi last method wa develop last year by a second year here untill i explain to him the need for the encryption at which point he give up thi method it be however a valid method it be easer than but le secure anthony thyssen sysprog griffith university anthony magic be real unles declare an integer john
