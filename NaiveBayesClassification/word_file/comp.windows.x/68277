from oj oliver jone subject re xquerytree xgrabserver and robustnes in article josh josh marantz write i have an application that want to walk the server window hierarchy look for a window with a specific property i think what happen be that xquerytree gife me an array of n child but by the time i get to the nth child window it ha be destroy then i get a badwindow error and my application exit how can i make thi robust i think of the follow set up an x error handler that longjmp back to where i make the offend call is thi safe do i have to longjmp or can i just return badwindow be an x protocol error if you write a custom error handler which do not do exit the error handler will return and let ymy program carry on so use a xseterrorhandler be the way to go but never mind the longjmp register for destroynotify on all the window return from xquerytree too hard
