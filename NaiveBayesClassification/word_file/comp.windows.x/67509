from beck andre beck subject re x design choice for color handle question in article sirosh joseph sirosh write most graphic system i have see have draw routine that also specify a color for draw like drawpoint x y color or drawline color or fillrectangle color with x i have to do something like xsetforeground xdrawpoint d w x y why split thi into two function why do x designer decide to not associate the color with the object be draw and instead associate it with the display it be be draw on for flexibility anyway what you say be not really true the color information be associate with a graphicscontext not with a display and the gc is a parameter to the draw routine so if you need to fast switch between green dot line and blue one of width you can make gc for those case and then simply do xdrawline dpy win xdrawline dpy win for thi effect thi be eventually more complicate to do for the programmer but also much more efficient and flexible you would not include all the other parameter like line pattern with cap and joinstyle drawmode and so on in every draw call so why do it for color btw stay away from xdrawpoint if you do really need it to draw random point for image transfer there be image routine o o o brain inside o o o o andre beck abpsoft mehl o o o
