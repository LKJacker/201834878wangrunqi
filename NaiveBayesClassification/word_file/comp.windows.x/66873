from kk kerry kimbrough subject gui study do user want to build solution let me point out that both gui-based word-processor and text-based formatter both have a language one happen to be mouse and action-based and the other symbol-based true but that beside the point thi be a fact about an abstract model of what the gui user be do not about what they actually be do thi abstract model be only apparent from the perpective of a programmer of the system nb some user may see it too but only when they put aside the work at hand and start think like a programmer i not say that the programmer perspective be evil or stunt after all that what i do too i be say that ui designer must carefully distinguish between the conceptual model and they must ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system i do recall the actual stat but something like in person can be categorize a a symbol manipulator it would be interest to know more about the mean and basi for thi claim at any rate i do think thi be evidence that of user think like programmer banker financial analyst structural engineer these be all person whose work you could characterize a primarily symbol manipulation but what they do be not program and program be not require to do what they do to restate my previou point ye user want to build their own solution no they do not want to do program to accomplish thi
