from xmplu bernhard strassl subject announce ui development sy another user interface development system if you would like to implement x-toolkit application with c in a style like thi mini sample application clas test public xmwindow void cmd char void quit void public test xmwindow xm test window void initialize void test initialize xmdropdownmenu menu createdropdownmenu menu addlabel file menu additem entry menu item one cb test cmd entry menu item two cb test cmd nullentry menu addseparator menu additem entry e xit cb test quit addsubpane edit myedit edit myedit settext hello world void test cmd char n edit myedit settext n void test quit void exit void xmapp initialize new test initialize then continue read content of the current release readme xm be a user interface framework for the c language build upon and the x-toolkit it be design to be a simple and intuitive program interface to acces the functionality of commonly use widget xm wa initially create for the motif widget set now support for the athena widget wa add application create with xm run in both environment without change although many nice feature be only available when use motif in some situation xm extend the underlie toolkit provide a combobox borrow from ms-window but never try to replace it datum of user interface object be leave to the widget and only duplicate in rare case xm ha nothing common with motif beside the general idea to encapsulate motif widget in c object and the in it name many idea for the xm architecture come from digitalk smalltalk version which provide an easy to use framework for application in the very first time of development i use the window dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar smalltalk and xm dialog top level object in xm and which use the automatic layout feature of variou composite widget in motif and xaw which can be individually lay out with a user interface builder a first version of such a dialog editor be include in thi distribution control child of top level object the staticimage and all the button class can display x-bitmap format or color gif format picture a an alternative to a label text event handle be do by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirect xt callback to member function of xm object commoninteract ius be build upon the xm draw clas and provide component for build direct manipulative application is be a very simplify implementation of some feature from the commoninteract system research project of my institute in an approach to define a software achitecture for implement direct manipulative application with multiple interaction medium sound alternative input device if you be interrested look into the june issue of the joop sig publication journal of object oriented programming there should be my paper about commoninteract but be aware that it be my of the art from commoninteract ius be still undocumented and be include because it wa use to implement the dialog editor it currently support only draw primitive line rectangle circle but we plan to extend it to support bitmap and some control also known problem the xm draw clas ha no redrawing strategy alway redraw the whole window even after minimal change like select an object thi look very ugly on slow display and should be fix about thi first release xm be still incomplete and ha a lot of bug but we be use it here for smaller application which be run without problem so i think i can call it a release which can be use to develop application for any non-critical purpose commoninteract may be call a alpha release it development will be continue thi year because we plan to use it for another research project here beside incompletenes and the redrawing problem it seem to be stable and can be use for experimental application platform thi release wa compile and test on run hp-ux sun sparc run suno release run linux caution although the whole stuff wa initially develop use an at t standard c compiler thi release be test only with gnu g or above the next release will be test with both compiler where to get it i have upload it on a send a mail if you can not find it there e-mail addr below where to find more information the doc directory contain install how to build the library and example problem and limitation when use gnu g read a tutorial how to use xm a first try of a xm clas reference manual the readme file in the sample gife a brief description of each of the seven sample be free software for any non-profit purpose see the file for detail send any comment bug report and donation to the author bernhard strassl vienna user interface group institute for applied computer science and information system university of vienna lenaugasse wien austrium e-mail xmplu
