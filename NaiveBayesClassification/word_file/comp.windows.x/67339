from pmartz paul martz subject re static color will client like it in article roeber frederick roeber write i write an x server for some video-generation equipment the hardware be truecolor in yuv space in x term it ha a static color visual i would really like to have the server just present thi static visual but i not sure if thi will be acceptable to most x client the three problem i see be the colormap though huge be static all pixel would be byte wide because the hardware actually life in yuv space the translation rgb yuv will introduce some round error we try to ship an x server once that only support a truecolor visual the main problem we encounter be client write with logic like the follow if defaultdepth assume default depth be these client need an deep visual in the root window to run correctly other client do even bother to do that much and just outright assume they have a dynamic visual clas with a dynamic colormap xstorecolor do work on cmap associate with static or truecolor visual class but many client do bother to check they just start throw xstorecolor call at you though both be clearly client error thi be the case with so many client that it easier for you to expose pseudocolor a a default root window visual than it ever would be for all these client writer to change their client to do the right thing paul pmartz evan sutherland
