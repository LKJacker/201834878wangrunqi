from support technical support subject re over how reliable how be it implement in article ethan ethan solomitum write three q be it reliable i use it all day every day maintain my ftp site and answer mail vium support and i can honestly say that in the last few month i never have my machine go down due to any sort of tcpip network manager instability of course i crash my machine quite a few time on purpose during betum test and that sort of thing but the tcpip portion be quite stable however keep in mind that dvx and the network manager be only go to be a stable a the software they sit on top of so if ymy underlie network kernel be flakey you ca expect dvx to be terribly stable how do it send the information from a m window app over the protocol do it just draw everything a graphic into one window or do it use multiple window and essentially work more cleverly it just go a a window that ha graphic draw into it to vastly over-simplify what go on we just take the window graphic apus call and translate them directly to x-protocol unfortunately window wa not really write to be network-aware so sometime we see a speed penalty when an app do something stupid like send a big white bitmap to erase something rather than just draw a white box fortunately that sort of thing be rare if i want to run m word for example remotely do i have to run a separate copy of m window remotely and then start m word from that or can m word be start remotely on it own you need to run m window which word then run inside you could run multiple window program within the one winx window and window ha way to automagically start winapp when you start window so in practice it not really a major problem i have my system set up so that i can run winx which automatically start word full-screen for window so i never see any part of window but word quarterdeck office system internet support tom bortel info tech question support bb fax compuserve go quarterdeck anonymou ftp leave ymy email addres a password
