from beck andre beck subject re animation with xputimage in article dcr derek c richardson write two year ago i write a sunview application for fast animation of raster file with sunview become rapidly obselete i finally decide to rewrite everything from scratch in xview i put together a quick test and i find that xputimage be considerably slower factor of on average than the sunview command which move image datum from memory pixrect to a canva thi wa on a sparc ipx it seem that the x protocol communication be slow thing down or xputimage be inefficient or both my question be what the protocol ha to move the whole image from proces memory to server memory thi be the hog the conversion in the xputimage be fast be the fastest way in to dump plane image datum to a window can i take advantage of the fact that the client be run on the same machine a the server or be i stick with ye by utilize the mit-shm extension that provide an xputimage derivate that use share memory fine fast xputimage in which case i might a well give up now no you can still xputimage all of the frame onto pixmap thu move them to server memory and then replay them fastest use xcopyarea but be aware thi be a major server memory bummer o o o brain inside o o o o andre beck abpsoft mehl o o o
