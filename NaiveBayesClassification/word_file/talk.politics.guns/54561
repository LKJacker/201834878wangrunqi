from kdw kenneth d whitehead subject re ymy evil tax dollar at work wa re atf burn ranch etc etc mark sach represent the student for increased beverage acces siba write oh then why do the smoke and flame start from three different place in particular three different place where there be no apv well i only saw it start in one place a tank punch a hole in a wall and a it withdraw flame come out and spread quickly in the direction that a mph wind wa blow i saw a diagram in usa today yesterday and fire start at of the hole that the tank make a terrible negligent accident and if the government do start the fire then why be person try to get out of the compound maybe they could i often marvel at how person could get burn alive in the upstair of a story house on fire but it happen all the time what if they be in seal room try to avoid the ga and do know about the fire until it surround them remember the israeli hide in seal room during desert storm to avoid gas-bearing scud cripe mark be you really a college student maybe you ought to stop worry about increase beverage acces and start clear ymy head ever hear of question authority and beside oh i do know why i even bother ok i buy that you do seem totally clueles i find it tremendously chill that so many person seem eager to believe a murderou heavily-armed religiou cult despite much evidence to the contrary wellllll they be murderou they never harm or even threaten anybody until they be attack by a paramilitary force use military weapon and hardware and a far a evidence what be you talk about everything the fed have say they retract practically a soon a they get question in detail about it maybe you and ymy increased beverage acces buddy sit around the bar slur stuff like they shoulda kill all day ago do feel that way but then you probably one of those person still say about klinton give the guy a chance we do even know what he gon na do burp thought experiment suppose thi exact same thing happen under the bush administration what would ymy answer be then would you still prefer to believe the cultist no i do really expect a response to that challenge no problem you do have any question that scare any of u most of my mind be apparently more develop than your the answer be ye in a heartbeat thought experiment would you be mindlessly down on ymy knee with ymy mouth open blissfully suck up anything the fed say if bush be the president what no comeback ok go ahead say it read my lip no new taxe p but then again that be how mr clinton wa elect by person who believe that hi campaign promiss would be respect by him once he get into office um be that how all politician be elect not in such a great degree bush break one promise maybe two and we hold him accountable for it of course it take him the better part of year to do it slick only be in office day and he break lot of them anddd i imagine he also be hold accountable for that i can just see the campaign button now abc anybody but clinton so be there any particular reason the gummint decide to slaughter eighty person are they like just plain evil or what did they just wake up one day stretch and yawn and throw a dart at a map of the united state to figure out who to oppres that day i eager to know hmmm apparently you just get here nobody claim that it wa anything but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employee who normally do get thi kind of scrutiny when the me up and a far a how they pick the davidian who know maybe they figure that nobody care about such a politically incorrect group a a bunch of fundy out on the texa prairie maybe they figure they just go in there and run roughshod over the bd during their religiou service which wa the reason the fed give for the time of the raid rather than run into resistance maybe they knew that the bd be anywhere near a violent a the fed spin doctor be try to tell the public maybe they be afraid to try thi kind of thing on the crip and blood maybe it wa because the atf budget be up for approval and they seem to favor do something dramatic whenever that be the case of course their reason do matter only what they do and thi time person be just pay more attention to it and do bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader not if you mean that stupid do stop think about tomorrow how be he on diabolical laughter all i ever hear be hillary diabolical giggle waffle man seem to have lose hi sense of humor do he look good in a cape do know never see him in one he probably look fat and puffy face just like in a suit i saw him in the rose garden the other day and i could get over how much he be start to look like teddy kennedy these thing must be investigate you first do worry these thing will be investigate now go back to ymy beer you dimwit i hear a lot of person compare bill clinton to jimmy carter and i like to go on record a say that i do think that it fair jimmy carter wa a veteran and he have personal character and even though i ca agree with carter policy i alway believe that he wa tell the truth a best he understand it i ca say that for the fat cat ken whitehead kdw
