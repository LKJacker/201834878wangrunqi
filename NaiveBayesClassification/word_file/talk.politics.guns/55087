from pat pat myrto subject waco willie authorize cook out wa re fbi director statement note local tx group trim out of newsgroup line in article donald l nash write in article cdt c d tavare write no you be right the first time law enforcement agency should keep hi opinion in mind before break into or assault anybody house ok let me correct my unfortunate choice of word i just hope that the law enforcement agency keep ymy attitude in mind the next time ymy wife be gang-rape by a bunch of juvenile drug-dealing thug while she wa jog in the park no strike that etc the batf come out with horse trailer man ninja uniform machine gun and stun grenade and use them before koresh could even look at the warrant koresh fight back and person die the key part of thi sentense be koresh fight back thi wa hi big mistake when the polouse decide to exert their authority over you you do fight back unles you want person to get hurt you cease all resistance and signal ymy submission to their authority the cop they be the bos you be the subject the concept of defense against illegal action under color of law be kaput no longer be it government of the person by the person it government of the person by the biggest gun the idea of it out in court later be fine but one ha to get to court in one piece to do that korash have good reason to think that he wa not go to get that chance see below be in it to beat up and kill person in spite of the action of a few bad apple if you quit resist they quit hit perhap the batf do over react to the threat pose by koresh perhap they do use too much force ok fine i will to concede to that point if sufficient proof be produce and i admit that there be some evidence to indicate thi however resist the batf be the worst thing koresh could have do if they have resist there be a good chance that no one would have be hurt remeber they be use stun grenade not anti-personnel grenade if the bd be not in violation of any rember korash do get to sort thi all out serenely type at hi keyboard he hear some kind of explosive go off he saw he wa be attacked with no overt action from him yet he could no more say it ok it only stun grenade anymore than i could he slam the door at that point and proceed to repel the attacker he felt in genuine fear of hi life i know i would be in fear of my life at that point have you ever be shoot at how clear and logically could you think under that pressure when you might have all of or second to evaluate what be go on and it would not be the first time that enforcement intend to bring in their suspect horizontally for all we know he wa inform by someone say something like hey guy the batf be come like gangbuster and they mean to waste you according to the latest news the release warrant so we be tell say the reason for thi ww iius raid wa that korash group have spend around on firearm and relate stuff over an undetermined period now even assume that the figure be calculate like the fed do a drug siezure for person that be really all that much you price decent gun lately hell i can think of a person right now that probably ha that much for one individual mostly machinegun sure he be an avid collector but unles a new law ha be pass it be not illegal nor an indication of anything illegal to have a lot of gun also note that the warrant have nothing to say about machine gun so what be the justification of thi cowboy raid other than a romp go bad for some anti-gun medium hype to support clinton push for disarm the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapon thi administration ha only one thing in mind control person control whether it be gun control clinton cripple chip national smart id card it all boil down to person control can you say only year late i know you could law they would have be release a they have be before if thi have happen and it turn out that the batf have use too much force then the bd would have grind for a law suit and for federal charge of civil right violation sound a lot like la huh do take that wrong i not comment one way or the other about the rodney king case but that not what they want they get tip off that the batf wa on the way in and rather than adopt a non-violent non-threatening posture to greet the batf they decide to fight and batf know the bd be expect them vium minute report but they decide they be so big so bad they would have a cakewalk at the bd expense for a nice medium show anyway but it all turn to shit and the fbi take over to manage thing we see it all turn to shit too clinton say be take full responsibility bah responsibility mean to take the repercussion if it go wrong bet you nobody pay any seriou repercussion only ha mean a medium pr or a a mean to corner the average joe schmoe figure it out clinton reno the fbi and batf will all be immune can you say whitewash i say enough of thi issue i probably not go to convince any of you folk and you certainly not go to convince me i get work to do don be very afraid of my government in the land of the free and if you decide all thi be acceptable get even more afraid especially when it be you they decide for some reason they dislike when they no longer feel the need to confine their cowboy tactic to or pat without prejudice ucc pat myrto seattle wa if all else fail try uunet pilchuck rwing pat wisdom only two thing be infinite the universe and human stupidity and i be not sure about the former albert einstien
