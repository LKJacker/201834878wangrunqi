from veal david veal subject re my gun be like my american expres card in article thoma parsli thomasp write abuse by the goverment thi seem to be one of the main problem any harder gun-control would just be abuse by the goverment either some of you be a little paranoid no offence mr parsli i have to take exception at thi there be verifiable previou example of level of government abuse gun-control restriction i do think it be paranoid to worry that what ha be abuse in the recent past might be abuse in thye future after so many time of get burn any sane person will stop put hi hand on the stave or you should get a new goverment you do have election i love to but a long a the politician grab power to sell pork back to their constituent there not a lot i can do it silly to suggest that if there anything we ca trust the government to do and therefore the government should be allow to do it then we should change government down that road ly total government power i never be a fan of totalitarianism gun criminal most weapon use by criminal today be steal thi be very likely known criminal can not buy weapon that one of the point of gun control and because gun control be strict in whole scandinavium and most of europe we dont have any problem with smuggle gun the north american continent be not europe no matter how many person would like it to be drug be very illegal and they here for year canada ha crow about it gun control if it be necessary to control gun over the whole continent then canada should have alway have comparable rate to the yet they still do unles you can tell me why the canadian border be so much more magical than the mexican border which be shorter and far more heavily patrol then i really ca accept that argument mixing weapon and thing that can be use a one what i mean wa that car can kill but they be not gun no there be approximately death due to gun in the two-third of which be suicide unfortunately i do have suicide rate for norway however thi make the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate the issue i hope i think we all agree that the criminal be the main problem gun be not a problem but the way they be use be and what be they for i think thi discusion be interest when you think of ex jugoslavium they should all have weapon it their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other innocent person the problem be human not gun the problem be human since before we have stone axe the fct of the matter be simply thi if nobody ever assault anybody whether there be a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent yet weapon be build i suggest then that the murderou impulse in humanity pre-date weapon anyway the bosnian et al have be make an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand year taking away their gun even if we could would neither halt the kill nor reduce the brutality if of all murder wa do with axe would you impose some regulation on them or just say that they be ment to be use at tree and that the axe be not a problem it the an example do flame me just because not exactly be kill by gun in the approximately of murder be commit with firearm with handgun with non-handgun the reason i say that gun per se be not the problem be that my non-gun rate exceed most of europe country entire violent crime rate i do really think we get more knife or fist in any case i think example of gun control apply to the have be abkect failure just like drug prohibition and other form of prohibition until you deal with why person be do what they be do you wo solve ymy problem and if the problem be violent crime you should concentrate on the tool instead the vast majority of gun be never ever misuse on the order of over the entire lifetime of the gun thi say to me that you ca make the argument that the gun itself cause the misuse think about the situation in lo angele where person be buy gun to protect themself is thi a good situation the situation be not good in that person fear for their life but recall the scene of the store-owner during the last riot protect their shop with gun would it have be better they too lose their livelihood is it the rigth way to deal with the problem the problem of poverty and rage in lo angele no it be however if that problem become a violent action then ye it can be appropriate whether or not some person ha be hurt by their condition wo make me le dead if they burn down my house with me in it you have to examine which problem you refer to if you discuss someone violently assault you then it be a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop hopefully simply let them know you prepare to shoot them would be enough a it wa with the above-mentioned store-owner if everybody buy gun to protect themself from criminal and their neighbor who have gun what do you think will happen i mean if everybody have a gun in usa of household have some form of firearm usually a long gun that account for a level of acces for at least million american firearm ownership be most likely among educate well-off white the group least likely to be involve in violent crime you may take that for what it worth david veal
