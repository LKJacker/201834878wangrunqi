other civil right rkba archive general information and anonymou ftp instruction the moderator of the firearms-politic mail list karl kleinpaste ha agree to set up an anonymou ftp archive directory for rkba relate information thi directory can be use for thing like article by kate wright tonso levinson supreme court decision the rium v u decision copy of legislation and so on it not mean to be for the discussion that normally appear here so in the future if you look for something check there first and then ask here instruction short version for techie the site be place contribution into the directory the ftp command get put mget or mput should work give the command type binary to be sure file be transfer correctly ymy file will be move to the rkba directory to get a file use the command get or mget i will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already be archive long version for techie in order for you to use thi archive ymy computer must be on the internet to connect to the archive site run the command ftp if that do work you can not use thi archive if the ftp command be successful you get thi prompt ask you for a login name lvc instead of lvc ymy initial will appear answer thi prompt with ftp next you get thi prompt ask ymy for ymy e-mail addres guest login ok send e-mail addres a password i would enter you enter ymy own e-mail addres you get these line or similar a output remote system be unix using binary mode to transfer file next the command prompt be print ftp if you do not get the line using binary mode to transfer file run the command type binary now you log in to the archive machine there be many directory on thi machine but the two you be concern with be and there be subdirectory to the rkba directory those be discuss below when you login to the system ymy directory be to retreive file change ymy current directory to the rkba directory with the command cd or cd to submit file change ymy directory to the incoming directory with the command cd or cd once you do thi you get another ftp prompt ask you to enter another command to find the name of the exist file in the directory you be in run the command l l thi will produce something like total r r r karl jun r r r karl apr index r r r karl jun r r r karl apr r r r karl jun r r r karl jan academia-bia r r r karl mar academic r r r karl aug aclu and so on each line correspond to one file reading right to leave the field be the file name the last modification date of the file the size of the file in byte and some permission field which you do not need to be concern with to get a file run the command get follow by the name of the file you want for example get index or get noduty after the file be transfer to ymy machine a message like thi transfer complete byte receive in second you can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive you can use the mget command to retreive multiple file if the file you want be in a subdirectory for example you should change ymy directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it cd get once you finish you can log off with the command quit if you have a file you want to contribute the procedure be a little different first of all you should find out if the file already exist so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you would repeat an entry the index will have a description of each of the file in the rkba directory for example file whitemanslaw white man law by william r tonso from the december reason magazine once you determine you wo be duplicate an entry login and change to the incoming directory command see above once you be in the incoming directory use the command put in thi case put whitemanslaw again there be a transfer complete so many byte transfer in so many second message now ymy file be on the archive machine another thing to watch out for be duplicate file name be sure there be a file in the incoming directory that be call the same a the file you want to write if you use the same name you overwrite the previou file or you get an error message ymy file may have to be rename if there be a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory once ymy file be in the incoming directory send me an entry for the index file and i will add it to the file if you can not use anonymou ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and i take care of the rest if you submit a file and do not notify me it may be remove so be sure to let me know first if you have any question feel free to ask me larry cipriani michael phelp external mjp internal mjp mjp at kgnvmy and last but not least a disclaimer these opinion be mine
