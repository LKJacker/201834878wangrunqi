from jmd jim de arra subject re gun buy back in article write in article jb write in article write gun buyback program will hopefully have an impact on accidental shoot especially youth domestic dispute where a gun be available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few gun from be steal and later use in street-level crime what gife you the idea that gun buyback program will have an impact on any of these thing evidence please please do misinterret what i wa say joe i wa make the point tha there be no evidence of effect of gun buyback program but hopefully if there be any effect it may prevent injury or death in one of these type of common incident if you a research associate in urban child research then perhap you can comment for u on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the rate of accidental death from other single cause follow that perhap with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti-gunner spend try to convince the country that accidental gun-related death among child in the be a seriou problem firearm be the fifth-leading cause of unintentional death among child age and under i do understand how the ratio to other accidental death be important so gun do kill a many child a car accident what be the difference in severity between death and death i be not try to use accidental gun-related death among child a a justification for gun control who need to be convince that accidental gun death of child be a seriou problem i assume that any humane person would be concern when any year old get hold of their parent gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blow away one of their friend any death be seriou wan na discus match control firearm relate unintentional death among child age and under be the fault of one or more negligent person not the gun more than anything gun buyback program be symbolic offer to the community in that sense i think they might do a little good please explain why you think symbolic offer do good my point wa gun buyback program which be almost alway run by polouse department might i stres might do a little i stres little good by give person the impression that the polouse be attempt to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i think that i have make it clear that i do not think that gun buyback program be useful providing false hope then be the intent i do know that the vast majority of gun that be use by youth or bring to school by youth on a daily basi about youth be obtain easily and quickly through a personal friend or more often borrow from a parent without their knowledge i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistic i suspect you find if you look carefully that be the number of student estimate to have carry a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of student who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence or the center for disease control if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of gun in the life of youth the cphv report that youth bring gun to school daily and that bring gun to school at least once a year the cdc estimate that out high school student carry a gun to school at least once in the cdc also say that million elementary-aged latch-key child kid who come home from school to an empty house have acces to gun in their home californium school report a increase in student gun confiscation between and and a increase between and florida report a percent increase in gun incident in school between amd these be the statistic increase in californium school eh gun control be work fine there thu will to follow a man who claim to be the messiah got news for you folk if the big cheese wa on thi crazy planet of our presently he would not be carry a gun or hold child when they be in danger holding kid time for a reality check son these kid be the child of the person inside who believe that the force of evil be outside wait to kill them would you send ymy child out the door if you believe a they do okay maybe i word it wrong dad i mean that to put child in a situation fortify compound where harm could come to them be not the act of a messiah in my opinion i not say that koresh have control over these child directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there be would not let innocent child die if a he claim he wa the messiah and person follow him a such why do he not tell their parent to free the child instead of let them burn alive thank for the reality check joe it be real so ymy religion be different do that make it hi wrong even assume koresh actually make that decision and the verdict be still out on that rodney jim jmd i alway rethink that there never be a day when i have rethink that but i ca do that by myself bill clinton april if i be an american a i be an englishman while a foreign troop wa land in my country i never would lay down my arm never never never william pitt earl of chatham nov
