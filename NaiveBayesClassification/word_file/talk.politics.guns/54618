from jb subject re gun buy back in article write in article jb write in article write gun buyback program will hopefully have an impact on accidental shoot especially youth domestic dispute where a gun be available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few gun from be steal and later use in street-level crime what gife you the idea that gun buyback program will have an impact on any of these thing evidence please please do misinterret what i wa say joe i wa make the point tha there be no evidence of effect of gun buyback program but hopefully if there be any effect it may prevent injury or death in one of these type of common incident saying hopefully the effect of policy x will be y be much different from say hopefully if there be any effect of policy x it will be y here you make both statement if the former describe a reasonably-likely outcome of policy x then perhap policy x be worthy of consideration but the latter statement be not something to base policy decision on firearm be the fifth-leading cause of unintentional death among child age and under according to group like the center to prevent handgun violence formerly the national coalition to ban handgun interest name change do you think who include murder and suicide by firearm in the lead cause of unintentional death figure but include murder and suicide by other mean a cause of unintentional death ca you see past the bullshit i do understand how the ratio to other accidental death be important so gun do kill a many child a car accident what be the difference in severity between death and death i be not try to use accidental gun-related death among child a a justification for gun control who need to be convince that accidental gun death of child be a seriou problem i assume that any humane person would be concern when any year old get hold of their parent gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blow away one of their friend certainly accidental death by any cause be seriou thing but the anti-gun group insist over and over again that accidental death by firearm be a stastically seriou problem and even if you do use these death a a justification for gun control these group do i sorry if i jump to conclusion about ymy reason for mention accidental death due to firearm be something that warrant concern but in light of ymy statement that you be a staunch supporter of gun control measure i think the conclusion wa a reasonable one the fact remain that tragic though individual accidental gun death may be they be not a seriou problem statistically speak please explain why you think symbolic offer do good my point wa gun buyback program which be almost alway run by polouse department might i stres might do a little i stres little good by give person the impression that the polouse be attempt to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i think that i have make it clear that i do not think that gun buyback program be useful sorry if it wa clear to me i think you be waffle on ymy view of buyback program with the talk of symbolic offer and hopefully prevent accident and heat-of-passion shoot i have to disagree on all these count i ca understand how a buy gun from person who be intend to misuse them obviously those who want to use gun to commit crime be go to turn them in could be construe a a positive way for polouse to respond to interpersonal violence i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistic i suspect you find if you look carefully that be the number of student estimate to have carry a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of student who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence what the person who publish figure say that a many child commit suicide by handgun alone each year a the fbi say commit suicide by all method per year who do you think i should believe the person who call everyone up to age child when they scream about the carnage of my nation child be cause by handgun or the center for disease control ah ye the agency that consider accidental shoot of child to be such a statistical problem that a state objective in the healthy person document be to enact law in state require manufacturer of handgun to make the handgun more difficult to fire minimize the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by child the agency that fund the study of dc which pronounce that the dc gun ban have save x life ye they actually give u a number on the basi of a look at the number of shoot rather than the rate of shoot it wa their fault that the population of dc drop in their post law period if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of gun in the life of youth the cphv report that youth bring gun to school daily and that bring gun to school at least once a year the cdc estimate that out high school student carry a gun to school at least once in okay i concede i no longer have the number i once read on these i retract my dispute of ymy number however i would be greatly interest in see how cphv and cdc come up with these number the cdc also say that million elementary-aged latch-key child kid who come home from school to an empty house have acces to gun in their home what thi get to do with anything hell when i wa in elementary school i come home to an empty house with gun in it why be thi a problem i do touch the gun i have be teach not to i have also be teach not to me with the gasoline in the garage the fuse box the car the knife the oven and the tool the problem be not the gun it the parent californium school report a increase in student gun confiscation between and and a increase between and florida report a percent increase in gun incident in school between amd these be the statistic and what be these state do with the kid they find with gun nothing no criminal prosecution no expulsion in most case not even suspension they take the gun slap the kid on the wrist say ai it awful and go on a if everything back to normal what wrong with thi picture okay maybe i word it wrong dad i mean that to put child in a situation fortify compound where harm could come to them be not the act of a messiah in my opinion i not say that koresh have control over these child directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there be would not let innocent child die i do think koresh wa the messiah either but be it obviou that if he believe the force of evil be come to destroy him then he believe the child be much safer inside the compound i do say he wa sane just that he behave in a pretty rational manner give what he think wa go on he think he have them in the one place where harm come to them if a he claim he wa the messiah and person follow him a such why do he not tell their parent to free the child instead of let them burn alive let see you try to find the exit unbarricade them and flee a fire when you be keep awake for most of day by loudspeaker and subject to six hour of tank knock in ymy wall and tear ga assault joe
