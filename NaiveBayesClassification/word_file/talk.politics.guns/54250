from earlw earl wallace subject re with friend like these l neil smith look if you can figure out a reliable mean of keep gun away from bad person while not interfere with good person i think we all be for it the problem be the method we use now do do the trick do manufacture them do sell them do import them some gun will get through but far fewer and far le person will die because of them hunting weapon could be allow of course a long a they be big and bulky and require reload after a few shoot how many time can you shoot at the same animal anyway one assume they be move a better solution if the person ca be trust with gun then lock them or knock them off stop punish good person
