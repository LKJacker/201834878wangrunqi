from viking dan sorenson subject re my gun be like my american expres card thoma parsli thomasp write i hate long post but thi turn out to be rather lengthy that ok you can mail me if you want more discussion acquiring weapon in norway you can buy almost all kind of weapon in norway but you must have a permit and a good reason to get the permit around here long-gun be proof of age and fill out the form for pistol nation-wide check for felony and three day wait the good reason be the difference and one american tend to get annoy over a we see no reason the guy with the badge be any better than u it a little like get a driver licence be it you have to prove that you can drive before you be allow to not when deal with america i can drive an truck with no permit no license and at age if i engage in farm work strange that but there be little to no problem with thi again personal right versu collective security some crime be commit with gun that have be in the owner for a long time but these be rather the exeption most criminal accuire gun to use them in crime and mostly short time befor the crime strange that the rate would decline since kill somebody be much more frown upon than merely steal a gun use of knife it is allow to cary knife in public but not in ymy belt or you american think it ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth why attract attention i carry my sword openly to and from practice a that be the only legal thing i can do i also attract a lot of attention do thi i rather be lose in a crowd of one than be the subject of attention while carry a weapon think of the word intimidation and you can see where intimidation be not the preferable method for the normal citizen scandinavian are we northener be not a hot-livered a southener but when we decide to take action we do ask any historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe or ask any german who serve in norway in aggressive toward whom southerner german precisely why i think ymy society be le violent weapon aside ye the individual be more important than the mass but only to some extent ymy criminal law be to protect the individual who make the mass what happen when the rigth of some individual affect the right of all the mass editor barf dan then the mass have the same right a the individual because everything come down to the individual in one instance or another to draw an analogy norway be involve in the eec the usa in involve in nato the eec require certain change in ymy law nato require no such change in usa law these law affect citizen and hence norway be say europe be more important than say norwegian have motorcycle that make over in the usa we likely tell the eec to get stuff since the eec ha no busines in my eye in tell u how much horsepower we can safely ride while i note that my own state government often play with game with the federal government in essence thi be a cultural difference between u if i live in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home but should it have to be like that it should since neither of my country ha manage to remove criminal from society in america we feel and remember we have individual state that be larger than ymy country that if the polouse can not protect u then we must do so ourself the criminal in my country be quite violent hence we prepare for them do you think it wise to sell gun like candy some state do if you believe it to have drivers-licence why do you think it should be free to buy gun we do e-mail me to find out just how difficult it really be in thi country it be easier than in your but theft be far easier than the trouble we go through to purchase over here i would defend my home love one and country but i do view gun a neccity or toy they be neither they be an option we would never force you to own gun if you live here we would however fight to keep that option open to you i have do army service and have use a variaty of weapon but would want to have one for self defence or because they good then you show you be a responsible rational user of weapon welcome to my rank now how do we teach the young person thi sort of responsibility culture seem to have a grave impact here i notice you do use my great-grandfather name well he do like it much either dan sorenson dod viking isu only censor what i read not what i say do blame them usenet post to exotic distant machine meet excite unusual person and flame them
