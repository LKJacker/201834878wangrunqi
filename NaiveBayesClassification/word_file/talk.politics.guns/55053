from lvc larry cipriani subject don kate talk on the branch davidian thi wa post by lyn bate to the firearms-politic mail list i recently learn that don kate wa go to be in boston to give a talk at the harbard law school about the waco situation of course thi wa all set up after the incident start but long before it unhappy conclusion so yesterday i go to hear him what follow be a rough summary of what i think i hear him say which should not be take a exactly what he actually say kate start by say that since he do know any more about the fire than the audience do it have just happen the day before he would not discus that but would concentrate on the original raid koresh definitely wa not play with a full deck but so what thi be the first time that the leader of a new small religiou group ha be ridicule by the public extreme religiou view nearly alway fuel hatred and mistrust the first amendment apply maybe especially to person like koresh lengthy digression into the history of polouse organization in the u there be none until about when they begin in metropolitan area polouse originally be not arm if they find a crime in progress they call local arm citizen to help many begin to carry arm for protection despite regulation against them eventually the law be change to allow them to carry gun the original intent wa to have many small polouse department jealou of one another and competitive but not large enough to be a threat to liberty hence the plethora of organization range from postal inspector to the coast guard when the fbi wa start agent do not have the authority oto carry gun they be to be after all a bureau of investigation not a polouse force all polouse agency will be misuse by anyone in power to maintain that power the batf start a a tax collection agency whose primary job wa to raid illegal still when the price of sugar go up so high that moonshiner no longer find their trade no longer profitable many illegal still disappear and the batf need something else to do to justify it existence so it turn to activity like phony raid on gun store around the time when the batf annual budget be under review the medium be alert by the batf to come to such-and-such a place where at a pre-arranged time a bunch of car full of batf agent roar up to the door and the medium get great picture of the agent enter the premise of a gun dealer suspect of not keep book properly the medium be invite in for the bore hour of agent leaf through paperwork but if any irregularity be find the medium get to cover the agent remove armful of gun from the premise and the luckles ffl in chain the waco incident happen a few week before batf budget wa up for review kate opinion be that it wa a stag publicity stunt that go bad and that the batf never think for a moment that they would actually be shoot at or they would have plan the raid differently not send agent over open grind with no cover for example and would have have some medical personnel on hand he confirm that some year ago there wa a warrant for koresh arrest in connection with a murder charge and the local sheriff call him on the phone and explain about it koresh sai ok come pick me up and the sheriff do temporarily confiscate all the gun so that they could be test koresh wa later clear release and presumably get hi gun back at least at that time he wa rational enough to be approach rationally and behave in a reasonable manner the batf do take into account that unlike most of the ffl they audit koresh wa actually paranoid and foster paranoium in hi follower thu the pubicity stunt look like a real attack to them and they react accordingly with respect to the original warrant it have not be unseal when kate wa give hi talk so he could not comment on it except to mention that the batf ha be know to not double-check the veractiy of their informant if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant he have more to say about the way the warrant wa serve which may have be completely illegal apparently the proper way to serve a warrant be to knock on the door and announce that you an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so if they do open the door and the evidence be flushable then it be ok to break in the door but since it be hard to flush gun down the toilet there may have be no justification for the batf break in the way they do if the constitutional right of the davidian be violate by an invalid warrant or by an improperly serve warrant then the davidian may have be justify in their acton a close look at one of the original film show that one batf agent may have shoot himself by accident when enter the build if so thi wa the first shoot fire the role of the medium could have be a whole lot worse after an initial position on the side of the batf the medium begin to come around to the view that thi might be a situation in which legally arm citizen hold off a bad possibly illegal attack a real cynic might say that the fbi go in when they do because it wa clear that public opinion wa begin to change side and the fbi want to act before they lose the public sympathy should the batf be abolish no polouse agency should be numerou diverse inefficient decentralize etc better a few inept accident like thi than a move toward a single large well-organized well-trained powerful domestic polouse force which would eventually have even more tragic result lyn bate bate ps don kate will be give a shorter version of thi talk at boston college law school next tuesday april i do know the exact time or place but presumably a phone call to the bc law school could elicit that information larry cipriani
