from jgd john de armond subject fbi murder wa re atf burn dividian jmd jim de arra write i have believe all along that they could not let them live the embarrassment to the batf and the fbi would be too severe remember thi wa a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant there be no witness except the fbi all information filter through the fbi all they have to do wa allow one remote control pool camera be instal near the build and the pres could do their job and would be able to back the fbi story with close up video while incur no risk to the pres unles they do not want the public to see something the complete lack of any other source of information other than the fbi really cause me concern sick to my stomach and get sicker from all the government apologist well put jim i be a concern about the medium complicity in thi grow coverup can you imagine the medium outrage the lawsuit the investigation that would emit if the government keep the medium away from any other story particularly if a republican administration have be behind it what go on here let look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happen next i a student of human phychology particularly in the area of psy-op because i find some of the technique to be useful in busines negotiation that put me firmly in the amateur rank thi amateur know that the first thing to do when size up the opponent be to do a psychological profile on him you can bet ymy a the fbi have professionally do profile on koresh koresh behavior wa emminently predictable it be typical of person who move away from civilization to be will to fight to the death to preserve their isolation it would also be typical give koresh religiou orientation for such an individual to interpret a government assault a the apocalypse suicide be a an acceptable alternative to be consume in the apocalypse imho the fbi know all thi and decide after day of concentrate psy-op to initiate that apocalypse i believe they choose a course of action design specifically to push koresh over the edge while publicly appear to be act reasonably they knew that koresh consider the tank to be the chariot of fire mention in the book of revelation they knew that send tank oop combat engineer vehicle obstensibly to perform ga insertion love that newspeak would push him over the edge look at some support evidence koresh attorney mention on tv earlier today that one of koresh major concern wa the biblical role of the tank station around the compound the fbi through reno on larry king last night and at the news conference thi morning claim to have listen device in the compound if that wa true they knew their action be drive him to the brink they knew they be push the davidian toward ma suicide any rational and reasonable agency not interest in kill those person would at the first sign of preparation for suicide have pull completely back and would have get rid of all the armor instead they continue with the ga insertion right up to the point where flame appear the image that will remain etch in my mind be that of the tank strut back and forth in front of the burn compound gloat over the kill let step back and ass how thi thing could have be end without bloodshed thi technique would have require a law enforcement agency interest in constitutionally enforce the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieve a military victory and of vengence the way to have nab koresh wa simply to have announce a pull back abandon the assault tear down the concertina wire and remove the armor maintain covert surveillance of the compound and then exploit hi ego to flush him out exploiting hi ego would have be simple a simple invite or two from the tabloid talk show to come on tv and tell how he whip the u government would have be something he could not have resist he could have then be nab when he leave the compound simple clean and safe but because it would have require the fbi to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprive them of the revenge they seek it wa totally out of the question not without all that testesterone float around after all jannet reno have to show the world how big her ball be yesterday wa a sad sad day for the american system i be sick to my very soul john john de armond interested in high performance mobility performance engineering magazine tm interested in high tech and computer mariettum ga send ur snail-mail addres to jgd perform for a free sample mag lee harvey oswald where be ya when we need ya
