from cdt c d tavare subject re my gun be like my american expres card in article thoma parsli thomasp write if i would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gun-licence from the polouse and to be a member of a gun-club the polouse would check my criminal record for any seriou crime record of seriou mental disease now if a get my licence i would have to be an active member of the gun club for month before i could collect my gun so like what do you do during those six month to be active my town ha a similar requirement and it rather stupid before you can buy a handgun you have to be an active member of a gun club well how active can you be without a gun chief most gun owner feel a check of criminal record for crime and mental disorder would be a very good thing if it could be abuse by the government but every time thi be propose there be alway some trapdoor by which the government can deny ymy purchase even if you be perfectly qualify to own a gun and we oppose thi it a little like get a driver licence be it you have to prove that you can drive before you be allow to since the fatal accident rate for license automobile driver in the u be around time the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owner i think twice before use thi analogy beside the problem be criminal use of gun not accident there be about criminal use of gun in the u every year but only accident i do think it necessary to spend a lot of energy make sure a criminal can shoot a gun before he get one just like the check most gun owner feel positively about require safety course if they could be abuse by the government but they already have one state do hold the course another do fund them a third hold them only once a year with limit attendence to those with political connection is thi fair most criminal accuire gun to use them in crime and mostly short time befor the crime and how many of them acquire these gun from legal retail outlet how many be borrow steal smuggle buy on the black market use of knife it is allow to cary knife in public but not in ymy belt or you american think it ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth some state allow only open carry some allow only conceal carry some allow both some allow both but require license for conceal carry all you can say be if one of these mode ha a clear advantage over another in term of reduce crime or any other public good then state legislator someplace be do exactly the wrong thing which mean that they really do have any objective reason for these law other than their preference a bad way to govern scandinavian are we northener be not a hot-livered a southener but when we decide to take action we do hot-livered i love that expression here we say hot-headed individual v mass ye the individual be more important than the mass but only to some extent ymy criminal law be to protect the individual who make the mass what happen when the rigth of some individual affect the right of all the other typically the only criminal who can affect the right of all the other person be criminal in government office the rest of my criminal affect the right of only one or a few person at a time and they do thi during the commission of a crime possession of a gun by someone hurt no one else it be when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occur of course it be a crime for a felon or ex-felon to posse a gun but we do feel it be right to treat common citizen who have live good life a if they be just pre-felon wait to commit crime we should mix weapon and item that can serve a one i do understand thi sentence if i live in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home but should it have to be like that life be fair i should need a fire extinguisher either or flood and theft insurance or to lock the door of my house and car but pin for a better world wo do anything to addres what i have to do to live in thi one do you think it wise to sell gun like candy some state do none of our i sure if you believe it to have drivers-licence why do you think it should be free to buy gun frankly i not sure i know what good a driver license do anyone either the person who drive safely never use it and the person who drive drink drive without it however a car be a good tool but not one that protect my right to life i rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely i not a pacifist or antus gun i would defend my home love one and country but i do view gun a neccity or toy i have do army service and have use a variaty of weapon but would want to have one for self defence or because they good the question be not whether or not you want to own gun personally it whether or not you think that all person should be force to do a you do i do have any problem with someone who say they would never own a gun i do have a problem with someone who say i should be prevent from own one too cdt if you believe that i speak for my company or cdt write
