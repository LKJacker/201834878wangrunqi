from porge don porge subject re jffo ha go a bite too far having read the post long article by jpfo i have some observation thi article do not claim that the gca of be a verbatim translation of a nazi law what it say be that in another place the book they talk about they compare the two thing section by section the implication be that the similarity be devastate in the next sentence they talk about how in that book they reproduce the german text of the nazi law together with it translation not surprisingly a reader could easily conflate these two thing into a single idea that the american gca be a literal translation of the nazi law and sure enough that what the whole thing ha mutate into urban-folklore style the article go to great pain to establish that senator dodd have a copy of the nazi law either from hi time on the nurnberg prosecution team or later thi fact be consider highly incriminate but i do understand why the author repeat several time that he be simply unable to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text and yet in a paragraph toward the end he explain it perfectly if dodd get hi copy of the original german text of the nazi weapon law during hi time at nurnberg it likely wa part of a collection of document for example issue of the reichsgesetzblatt the german law registry bingo exactly dodd have a book with a series of nazi law in it include the one under discussion all of the stuff about why would a congressman have a copy of a nazi law melt away by the author admission he then continue but if he acquire the original german text of the nazi weapon law after hi service at nurnberg he must have do so for a very specific reason but there absolutely no reason to think that thi be the case in fact a a senior member of the team that help to prosecute nazi war criminal it seem to me that he would have have to have a copy all argument about whether the nazi weapon law be really of historical interest a it obviously be certainly accord to the author here or whether dodd personally prosecute the interior minister who sign it can be put aside a red herring having establish that dodd own a copy of the original german text the jpfo article then try to draw sinister implication from the fact that he ask to have it translate the problem be in the context of the charge level at dodd these two thing work against each other person ask to have thing translate when they do know what they mean if dodd take it upon himself to preserve the nazi law with idea of someday introduce it into american law surely by he would have know what it mean would he anyway thi precise charge the main one that i question in an earlier post be just silly why would dodd need the exact translation for thi purpose is the idea that the gun controller despite be presumably bend on disarm the populace with the goal of eventually destroy all civil liberty need a crib sheet did they have any idea how to do it on their own once again the author provide a perfectly acceptable answer to hi own question dodd may have offer hi copy of the nazi weapon law to show that the specific proposal do not resemble anything in the nazi law in fact since the law and it translation be enter into the congressional record under the head of document concern the history of nazism and gun confiscation dodd motivation be a mystery he ask for the translation in order to put it in the cr even thi article make it clear that the part of the nazi law that wa add by the nazi regime be only a small part of that law registration of gun for instance wa begin in and thu not a nazi-inspired idea the part of the nazi law that parallel the gca include handgun control of some sort and the identification of certain weapon a sport weapon the jpfo then go on to list other part of the nazi law forbid ownership of weapon by jew of course there be no such provision in the american gca nevertheles in a rhetorical move guarantee to muddy the water immediately after the discussion of the anti-jewish part of the law the jpfo article continue given the parallel between the nazi weapon law and the so a to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law don porge porge uunet inmet porge
