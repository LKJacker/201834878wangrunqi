from dhartung dan hartung subject re the truth about waco jgd john de armond write nothing could at thi point what would have go a long way toward convince me would have be medium video particularly from diverse source imho if the government do have anything to hide they would have allow camera near the compound from the begin i agree i saw no reason they could not have have close in pool camera man by volunteer and protect by sandbag or whatever point make by dick degueran koresh lawyer the tank be not pump cs ga but be eject explode canister from the tank boom that penetrate multiple wall before explode okay their word against the fbi at thi point see ya in court the tank be collapse interior wall and ceiling put person at great risk dear dear they could have come out the construction of the coupound use almost all use material that be very dry and bail of hay be stack against the wall a shield against the government bullet okay they be live in a fire hazard that they build said that previou to the invasion there be no military drill and that the supply they have on hand be for survival no crime irrelevant either way their ga mask work so well that many member be have bible study and some be sleep when the fire wa set ah ye that be exactly what i would do hold bible study take a nap alway a wise course of action when you be gas there wa no group instruction of any kind from koresh or hi aid after the tank invasion refer to any kind of suicide pact or counter-assault effort i do believe there wa a suicide pact i believe that koresh want a fiery conflagration which he may not have tell hi follower in fact thi hypothesi be confirmed by the survivor story everyone have move to the center of the compound in order to escape the fall debris from the tank invasion when the fire wa set ye that right and once the whole compound wa demolish where do they expect to go woman and child who ha seek shelter on the second floor from the tank be trap by door jam by the tank ram the build and distort the frame the build be be rammed and they be go upstair that almost a bad a run into a fire hallway run the length of the build that act a conduit for the fire and trap almost everyone in place hi expert have tell him that thi horizonal chimney effect be what make the fire appear to have start at several place at once hm an interest notion we see koresh wa not see the last hmy before the fire and wa assume to be in hi floor room with some of hi child more bible study no doubt hey it a priority the texa medical examiner ha state flatly that none of the body recover so far have bullet wind directly contradict the fbi ly actually on friday he state that there wa no evidence either way and he could not flatly contradict the federal agent claim we know more later in any event it irrelevant the survivor unanimously state that if the victim could have get out they would have that they be trap by the tank-destroyed build and the speed of the fire for six hour they be trap the build wa not destroy immediately they could have left at any time the underground bunker cite by the fbi a the place koresh could have put the child have he not be a cold blood killer have be block by the tank crash down debris on top of the acces door six hour to move it away or come out dick say that he have sit in koresh bedroom talk to him and have observe that hi room wa furnish like all the rest and without air condition or other luxury directly contradict the fbi claim that he live in splendor irrelevant anyway pr one way or the other but no crime or innocence indicate dick saw bullet hole in koresh room make from the outside-in which indicate the batf wa indiscriminately shoot down through the roof no word on whether they be be fire back at which be an operative question here the fire wa probably start by the tank knock over coleman lantern that be light and sit on a piano next to the wall the tank bust through though none of the survivor saw the fire start right for six hour you know that a tank could come thru the wall at any point and you leave a coleman lantern burning near bale of hay every one of the survivor strongly deny ever say anything to the fbi about start the fire hear someone say the fire wa light or any of the other stuff attribute to them by the fbi it ultimately irrelevant who light the fire they have ample opportunity to leave he say when he first meet koresh in the compound he expect to find a rave lunatic but instead find a rational charm and intelligent young man and wa very surprise by that fact most charismatic leader be extremely intelligent actually they tend to be excellent actor and skilled manipulator ex ted bundy koresh have no drug stronger than aspirin to use against pain medical assistance wa jsut a phone call away gee all he have to do wa come out woman with child have their own bedroom for them and their kid that be appoint a nicely a koresh not relevant to any crime dick say he saw sign of home school for the kid and at no time do he ever see any sign of abuse while he wa there anyway outsider rarely see abuse it a secretive thing all we have to go on be the court document in the jewell case and the mistrial in californium no one wa ever hold against their will and could have leave at any time the person who be murder in the fire be there by their own choice exactly by their own choice he call for an independent prosecutor if ever there be a need for one thi be it look like there will be several investigation start with congressional committee hear next week hi close comment be they do look upon themself a a cult they view themself a highly religiou person they sincerely believe what they believe and who be you or i to judge that a wrong hi last sentence say it all who the hell are we or the government to judge their religion a wrong thi event i hope will be record in history a the american holocaust these person be murder by the u government just a surely a the jew be by the nazi i hang my head in shame for what i allow my government to become i have never judge them by their religion but by their action if they have live a quiet religiou life a they claim there would have be no raid no siege and no death instead they choose course of action at every turn that be at the very least stupid if not irrational the first wa to stockpile weapon the second wa to shoot federal agent the third wa to stay inside just a we do blame a cop who shoot a kid who have point a toy weapon at him i do think the fbi deserve blame in thi case the koresh cult standoff be over may hi victim recquiescat in pace the above be a of silence daniel a hartung dhartung ask me about rotaract
