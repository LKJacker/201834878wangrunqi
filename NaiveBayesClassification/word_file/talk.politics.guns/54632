from lvc larry cipriani subject re need info on and suicide for refutation here something preston covey professor of ethic at cmu write from preston k covey covey subject gun stat mortal risk date mon feb est folk hail from the nether world on february the wall street journal carry a front-page article by erik larson entitle armed force i felt a reply wa in order to hi citation of the notoriou scare stat that a gun be time more likely to kill than to protect i send the follow to the wsj gun stat mortal risk preston k covey erik even-handed article on paxton quigley armed force wsj cite the most notoriou statistic regard gun in the home a pioneer study of residential gunshot death in king county washington find that a gun in the home wa time more likely to be use to kill it owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder the time stat be everywhere these day it ha grow in medium lore like the proverbial urban myth it wa inflate by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to given the shock value of the find the conclusion of the new england journal of medicine nejm study be remarkably understate the advisability of keep firearm in the home for protection must be question responsible person should indeed question the risk and benefit of bring a firearm into their home but what we need to know be thi what exactly be the risk and benefit the nejm testimony be neither the whole truth about the benefit nor nothing but the truth about the risk further a with motor vehicle we want to know what control do we have over the risk and benefit and a with the risk of cancer or heart disease or auto accident how can we minimize the risk like raw highway death toll the nejm stat be not very helpful here the nejm find purport to inform u but it be frame to warn u off it be widely promulgate in the medium a a scare stat a mislead half-truth whose very formulation be calculate to prejudice and terrify the frightful statistic scream for itself the risk far outweigh the benefit ye what fool would run these risk if ymy car be time more likely to kill you a love one a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to ymy destination should you not take the bu uncritical citation put the good name of statistic in the bad company of ly and damn ly surely we can do better where life be at stake take a closer look at thi risky busines the time stat of the nejm study be the product of divide the number of home justifiably kill in self-defense the divisor into the number of family member or acquaintance kill by a gun in the home the dividend the divisor of thi risk equation be in the five-year sample there be intruder and other case of self-defense the dividend be in the study there be accidental death criminal homicide and suicide divide by yield there be a total of gun-related death in king county between and so the study leaf death outside of home unaccounted the notoriou time statistic be seriously mislead on six count the dividend be misleadingly characterize in the medium the or acquaintance of the study who include ymy friendly drug dealer and neighborhood gang member be equate to friend the implication be that the offend gun target and kill only beloved family member dear friend and innocent child death may all be equally tragic but the character and circumstance of both victim and killer be relevant to the risk these crucial risk factor be mask by the calculate impression that the death toll be generate by witles walton shoot dear friend and friendly neighbor thi be criminological hogwash the study itself do not distinguish household or environ populate by person with violent criminal or substance-abuse history where the risk of death be very high versu household inhabit by more civil folk for example person who avoid high-risk activity like drug deal gang bang and wife beat where the risk be very low indeed in actuality negligent adult allow fatal but avoidable accident and homicide be perpetrate mostly by person with history of violence or abuse person who be identifiably and certifiably at high risk for misadventure to ignore these obviou risk factor in firearm accident and homicide be a mislead a ignore the role of alcohol in vehicular death by tautology neither gun death nor vehicular death would occur without firearm or vehicle but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk one mislead implication of the way the nejm stat be frame be that the mere presence of a gun in the home be much more likely to kill than to protect and thi obscure indeed disregard the role of personal responsibility the typical quotation of thi study unlike attribute fatal agency to the gun a gun in the home be time a likely to kill the center to prevent handgun violence a major promulgator of the nejm statistic use thi particular formulation we can dispense with the silly debate about whether person or gun that accomplish the kill again by tautology gun death would not occur without the gun the question beg be how many death would occur anyway without the gun in any case person be the death-dealing agent the gun be their lethal instrument the moral core of the personal risk factor in gun death be personal responsibility and choice due care and responsibility obviate gun accident human choice mediate homicide and suicide by gun or otherwise the choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to high-risk pool the gun do not create thi risk by itself person have a lot to say about what risk they run with gun in their home for example graduate of paxton personal protection course do not run the tout time risk any more than skilled and sober driver run the same risk of cause or suffer vehicular death a do reckles or drink driver undiscriminating actuarial disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice just a they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic criminological and other risk-relevant factor in firearm-related death thi be why we resent insurance premium and actuarial consigment to risk pool whose norm disregard my individuality fortunately nothing can consign u to the nejm risk pool but my own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter suicide account for of the death by gun in the home in the nejm study a against the total death by gun in king county include those outside the home in-house suicide be of the total death toll which be closer to the roughly proportion find by other study suicide be a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accident the implication of the nejm study be that these suicide might not occur without readily available gun it be true that attempt suicide by gun be likely to succeed it be not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicide thi be widely assume or allege but the preponderance of research on gun and suicide actually show otherwise that thi be wishful think in all but a few truly impulsive case see bruce l danto et al the human side of homicide columbium university pres charle rich et al gun and suicide american journal of psychiatry march if suicide be remove from the dividend of the nejm risk equation the time stat would deflate to six the inclusion of suicide in the nejm risk equation like the cause durability or interdiction of suicidal intent itself be a profoundly debatable matter quotation of the nejm study totally disregard thi issue citation of the nejm study also mislead regard the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide most measure like the nejm homicide rate be base on the immediate disposition of case but many homicide initially rule criminal be appeal and later rule self-defense in the literature on batter woman immediate case disposition be notoriou for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide january cover story on woman fighting back report one find that of woman who appeal have their murder conviction throw out july cover story on a week of gun death report of the domestic case a shoot by abuse victim but only of the homicide be report a self-defense in a may update time report that of the homicide have eventually be rule self-defense in sample the originally report rate of self-defense wa in error by a factor of fmy the possibility of such error be not acknowledge by promulgator of the nejm statistic while both the dividend and the product of the nejm risk equation be arguably inflate the divisor be unconscionably mislead the divisor of thi equation count only aggressor who be kill not aggressor who be successfully thwart without be kill or even shoot at the utility of arm self-defense be the other side of the coin from the harm do with gun in home what kind of moral idiocy be it to measure thi utility only in term of kill do we measure the utility of my polouse solely in term of felon kill a oppose to the many many more who be otherwise foil apprehend or deter should we not celebrate let alone count those case where no human life be lose a successful arm defense the question pose to medium that cite the nejm scare stat be thi why neglect the compendiou research on successful arm defense notably by criminologist gary kleck point blank gun and violence in america aldine de gruyter estimation of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use be base on victimization survey a well a other study the rate be high about one million a year and the risk be good gun defender fare better than anyone either those who resort to other form of resistance or those who do not resist dividing one million gun defense a year by annual gun death from self-defense homicide suicide and accident yield thu we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the nejm scare stat a gun be time more likely to be use to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody of course critic belittle the dividend of thi calculation what be good news for gun defender be bad news for gun control we should indeed question the basi and method of high estimation of defensive firearm use a i have question the nejm statistic clearly the issue of how to manage mortal risk be not settle by uncritical citation of statistic one thing trouble me still we can hardly escape the unquestioned nejm scare stat in my medium but we hardly ever find good work mention even critically larry cipriani
