from cdt c d tavare subject re the for deer no hunting in article jrm write you might have miss the news world report excerpt i post it be fairly consistant with other such poll find that approximately of household have at least one firearm ok a near-majority actually own firearm but i will still claim that the vast majority never need to use them or even threaten anyone with them to self-defense incident a year do count with you what do they do right or be they just lucky maybe they just unlucky if a rapist pull a woman into an alley in boston chance be almost certain that she wo be count a one of those self-defender because my local constabulary do consider it important that she be allow to arm herself even though the shotgun she own at home make her show up in the gun owner column in either case thi mean the threat level in thi country be rather low ironic word for somebody who life in florida the average threat level in florida ha be reduced by a liberal ccw policy it well know that ymy local thug like to target tourist precisely because they be le likely to be carry than ymy native come on up to boston or nyc or washington dc and see how much diddlysquat the average threat level in the country mean to a resident there i think you have weapon on the brain i never say that these alternative mean of self-protection involve any hardware why be neighborhood it be because every person be arm to the tooth it be because of attitude and cooperation in the neighborhood the resident make themself aware of their neighbor and notice when stranger be lurk around neighborhood form group like to increase thi effect and the relative effectivenes of the polouse when hostile be arrest the good neighbor step up and say that the one officer he wa rob mr jone house sometime thi work sometime it just land ymy good neighbor on the dance card for the next wave of drive-by someone here once tell a story about la gang move into phoenix i misplace the original text but the story start with one resident call the cop on a gang member sure enough a few night later there wa a drive-by perform at the resident house except that thi time unlike in la the entire street come out and return fire put an end to the car occupant the gang pack up and leave of course in la or in a place like florida after the hurricane ymy first problem be to find an officer to step up to and tell anything in short the alternative to firepower be gang or at least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative replace lead with flesh the flesh make a better conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a block party look nobody be argue thi i have a fire extinguisher at home that do mean i can be careles about toss my burn match on the carpet i live carefully monitor the woodstove get my flue clean twice a year and test my smoke alarm annually but if despite all thi a fire do start it too late for any of these thing except the extinguisher but legality and legitimacy also matter if a government charter make a rule which the government then violate it be violate the basi for it existance enforcement of it will become a matter solely of force of arm oliver north the man be positively worship in many all-american quarter he and big ron set-up a secret government and do all sort of severely illegal deed the kind of stuff you and i would be do twenty-to-life for yet he walk free thi b happen all the time in fact it happen so much that no one really care anymore be a non-issue legality be a non-issue so long a we get t-bone and my mtv who gife a rat a you seem to be agree with ymy opponent you ca trust ymy government to protect you from abuser and violator white-collar blue-collar epauletted or tank-shirted ultimately no one ha the power to enforce ymy right but you unles you give up that power no i claim that no one be interest in the statistical aspect of the argument pure emotion like the abortion issue too many person fit that category that be true some of u like to believe that they be uninterested in the fact behind the case for gun ownership because they be condition to believe that there are any you seem content to underestimate the electorate i will to try to raise their consciousnes argue away you ca win i think we can hcus wa found in what in the they run a one million strong campaign for two year before reach thi goal my understand be that they reach it by the stratagem of include wide class of person other than dues-paying member i ca speak authoritatively on thi maybe somebody else ha detail then they start run a two million strong campaign for a while but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it become clear that they simply be never go to reach that level of membership in just after the commencement of the dodd hearing the start point of the modern gun-control movement the nra have a mere member by barely after the first murmur of future registration it have about a million today it ha over three million member make it the third largest membership organization in the country next to aarp and aaa and it membership be growing faster than at any previou time historical figure from kukla gun control pp and a you say many of the person in the middle of thi debate be bemuse by their t-bone and mtv that leaf hard-core gun-owner against hard-core gun banner i know a number of ex-hcus member who have recently become nra member i never hear of a single one who ha go the other way ye i think we can and will win thi one firearms-related mindles mayhem will be relate to the availibility of firearm if they become scarce and and expensive a different psychology will take hold i think they would be use far le to settle trivial complaint i think they would be use far le to hammer nail a well but like you i ca give any citation show that thi utilization be currently significant at more than an anecdotal level if you can i wait cdt if you believe that i speak for my company or cdt write today for my special investor packet
