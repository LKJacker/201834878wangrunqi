from odysseu aaron walker subject re murder almost everyone in waco today in article roby scott w roby write and another survivor claim he hear someone shout the fire start odd terminology that what one say when you know a fire be plan not when one occur by accident it also what you say when you wait for the end to come in a fiery apocalypse just a think personally if the fire wa set by either side i wonder about the time if koresh co set the fire why wait through six hour of wall-bashing and tear-gassing before start wa there anything new that happen just around that point similarly if the fbi be go to torch the place and fake it of course why wait so long would it be more reasonable to believe the bd would set the fire early after the assault begin the most plausible to me explaination be that of an accidental start of the fire by the tank among other thing i say that because i wa listen to the radio when the fire start and the reporter watch from a distance of course say that it look like at least one of the tank have penetrate farther into the build than previously specifically he say that one tank apparently wa halfway half of the tank lenght into the build where it previously have only be penetrate a few foot reserve judgement aaron
