from bressler rick bressler subject re gun lover wa re my gun be like my american expres card iftccu vincent vincent fox be apr thi be so maybe thi be get a bet technical but i ca resist a revolver also ha the advantage that if it misfire you just pull the trigger again sometime depend on why it misfire a double-action revolver almost all of them can be hand-cocked first but will fire merely by pull the trigger i ca imagine do much combat type shoot single action a misfire in a revolver merely mean you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round assuming the cylinder will rotate a revolver can be carry with the chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be draw and fire with an easy motion even one hand never hurt to err on the side of safety but if you get one of those fangled hammer block or transfer bar safety it unnecessarily redundant i rather have the extra round speedloader for a revolver allow reload almost a fast a magazine on semi-auto can be faster depend on user quite true speed loader be a little le convenient to pack around than magazine though a misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jam shell first time spend which can be fatal and a vital second or so be often lose a you realize hey it jam before start to do anything about clear it true but thi be a train function most semi-auto must have the slide work to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some polouse carry their semi-auto with the chamber load and hammer cock but a safety engage i do not consider thi safe however you must trade-off safety to get the same speed of employment a a revolver cocked and lock for single action or hammer down on double action be the only carry mode that make sense the series colt for example be quite safe to carry thi way there be some double-action semi-auto out there but the complexity of operation of many of them require more train agreed now that i shoot off my mouth a bite let me back some of thi up it be true that a simple misfire on a revolver do cost you much on the other hand i have all sort of interest thing happen over the year for example i have factory ammunition that ha have high primer a high primer will tie ymy revolver up somewhere from second to minute while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem an auto jack the slide and continue i have bullet come out of the case keep the cylinder from turn see clear paragraph above about the worst that can happen with a semi auto be a double fee thi can be clear in second most revolver be more then semi auto there be all sort of close tolerance part and fit involve dropping the gun or a blow to the gun or all sort of thing can take it out of action many of the problem that can be cure on the spot with a quality semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver in short a revolver may be le likely to malfunction but a a rule when it do you out of the fight the majority of malfunction that occur with semi auto do not fall into that category vincint make many good point in thi post but leaf off the oppose view of most of them a real good start place be ayoob the semi auto pistol for polouse and self defense in general i agree the revolver be an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that do not have the time and inclination that be necessary for the train and practice need to use a semi auto effectively a a self defense arm most cop be notoriously indifferent to firearm if the department be go to train them they be go to take the time on their own there be no doubt that train be an issue the amount of train require for effective use of a semi auto be probably several time that of a revolver many cop do bother for myself i hate to be limit to one or the other i rather pick what fit better with my personal inclination what i wear that day and so on like the moderator on say buy em all that say i have to admit that often my advice to person think of buy their first defense arm be right after take a clas get a ruger or smith revolver sorry colt fan colt revolver be ok too if thi post have go the other way i be argue for revolver rick
