from jason kratz subject re my gun be like my american expres card in article david veal say stuff delete me what seem to be happen here be the situation get totally blow out of proportion in my post i wa refer to ymy regular patrolman in a car cruise around the city v gang member of course the polouse have acces to the thing that you mention but do they use tank and such all of the time of course they do and that the point i wa try to make every day when i go out to lunch i alway see cop come in the majority that i see be still carry revolver not that there be anything wrong with a revolver but if you a cop that be up against some gang member with a couple of automatic in hi coat i mean semi-auto handgun you go to be at a disadvantage even with train david thi be the arm race fallacy that somehow bigger gun make an individual safer the problem be that for each correspond level of offensive power the be not an automatic level of defense increase the problem be that there a sort of lethality threshold that once you get past you only talk about a metter of degree regardles of what cop be up against there really no reason for the average beat cop to have anything bigger than a pistol on him a a personal weapon and maybe a rifle and a shotgun in the cruiser i mean think about it carrying a monster pistol or sub-machinegun do make the cop any le wound if somebody shoot him a lot of polouse departenment have switch to semi-automatic a better more reliable weapon and more stop power but there a point of diminish return thi be a very very good point who care what kind of gun you get if you lie on the grind dead and a far a automatic go any gang member carry around a couple of automatic an incredible rarity be go to be far more of a menace to himself and innocent bystander than anything he might be tryinh to aim at one auto be hard enough to control anybody who could control two be go to get the polouse officer regardles of what the polouse officer be arm with more stuff delete mostly mine my question be thi what would a polouse officer gain from have a sub-machinegun or similar personal weapon that he already do have with a or semi-automatic pistol i do see a how the polouse should be hose around full-auto fire nor ha my experience with polouse officer or the stat regard how many polouse officer get kill by other cop make me feel such would be a good idea precise fire be far more preferable nor should they use bigger gun most standard sidearm have more then sufficient stop power when properly apply all more powerful weapon would do be make the likelihood of death higher without really give polouse significantly more option another very good point that be well take it seem that when lot of lead be fly either the cop or the gang someone innocent alway get catch in the crossfire david veal univ of tenn div of cont education info service group i still remember the way you laugh the day ymy push me down the elevator shaft i begin to think you do love me anymore weird al all point make above be well take i gues i be in the mindset of have more make it better which be obviously not the correct mindset to take in thi discussion now that i think about the situation a little more carefully i see ymy point exactly david and i wholeheartedly sp agree like i say i just assume that more bullet bigger bullet be better once again though i want to state that i be a pro-gun individual and do not believe that gun control be really a viable option here in the united state regardles of the drivel that i spout here jason
