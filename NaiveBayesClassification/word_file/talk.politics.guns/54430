repair loan be available okay sez i if that all that wrong with it just why be you sell a house for all of well squirm the agent it in kind of a bad neighborhood how bad sez i remember some of the neighborhood i see in chicago and oakland worst in the city the agent sigh and then he tell me thi amaze story every few year it seem the big vice-gang in lo angele notice that there no gang presence in phoenix which be just a quick drive from la and get the idea of set up a subsidiary there well a couple year ago the colonize force come to thi neighborhood it be poor and spanish they figure they could move right in and take over buy thi house and start operation unfortunately for them the neighbor not only do like thi they do care for whore trot up and down their street all night pimp solicit their kid dope deal on the corner in broad daylight and so on they be afraid to do something about it the neighbor call the cop for some reason the phoenix polouse be remarkably honest capable polite and prompt and the cop promptly come and sweep up all the whore pimp and pusher off the street and away to jail the remain gang member decide to retaliate in the fashion they usually use in la they get the complainant name and addres off the court record and do a drive-by shoot at hi house well thi wa lo angele the moment the neighbor hear the first gunshot fire they all run out their front door with their own gun rifle shotgun pistol everything and shoot back the car do make it to the end of the block it coast to a stop riddle with more hole than the famou bonnie and clyde getaway car which i see it on display in a casino in a casino in la vega the ga tank and fuel line have be rupture so the car catch fire the neighbor wait a good minute make sure nobody get out of that car before they call the fire department to come put out the fire and tow the wreck away by that time the asphalt under the car have melt and catch fire too which subsequently leave a large and nasty pot-hole in the street the city be slow about repair small street so the hole stay there provide a traffic hazard for several month all thi wa two year ago the agent conclude and there be no trouble since but the house and the neighborhood still have a bad reputation and that why the house wa so cheap hearing thi story i nearly laugh my a off i tell the agent that if i have the money at the moment i by-god buy the house thi wa nothing compare to bad neighborhood i see here in californium where drive-by shoot go unchecked by the well-armed cop let alone by the unarm neighbor if that the absolute worst you find in phoenix then that the city for me that the difference that an arm civilian population make think about it mike van pelt when gun be outlaw mvp only carl rowan will have gun mvp
