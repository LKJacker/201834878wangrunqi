from andy andy freeman subject re my gun be like my american expres card in jason kratz write what seem to be happen here be the situation get totally blow out of proportion in my post i wa refer to ymy regular patrolman in a car cruise around the city v gang member of course the polouse have acces to the thing that you mention but do they use tank and such all of the time of course they do and that the point i wa try to make every day when i go out to lunch i alway see cop come in the majority that i see be still carry revolver so look in the trunk some time heck look at the dash that funny thing attach with a quick-release be a gun the one in the trunk be better i do have number for chicago but philadelphium polouse car carry multiple automatic weapon and thousand of round a standard issue in the not that there be anything wrong with a revolver but if you a cop that be up against some gang member with a couple of automatic in hi coat i mean semi-auto handgun you go to be at a disadvantage even with train what be the nature of thi disadvantage if the cop can shoot round will do the job against a single opponent especially since the cop ha guarantee backup if the gang member can shoot the extra round do help the only time thi difference can matter be if neither can shoot and cop be suppose to be throw lead around like that btw most cop carry multiple gun you not suppose to know about the second third and so on i have be at a shoot range where gang member be practice shoot how do we know that they be gang member and not undercover cop or even law-abiding menace minority btw why the sneer quote they be actually practice take out their gun a quick a possible and shoot at the target and they be do too badly either then the extra round wo make any difference so why be it an issue andy
