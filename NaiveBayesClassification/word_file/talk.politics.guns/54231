from jaf jame foster subject re my gun be like my american expres card in article vincent vincent fox write in jason kratz write delete and a far a fully-automatic weapon you can be a lot better arm if you want to hit what you aim at what seem to be happen here be the situation get totally blow out of proportion in my post i wa refer to ymy regular patrolman in a car cruise around the city v gang member of course the polouse have acces to the thing that you mention but do they use tank and such all of the time of course they do and that the point i wa try to make every day when i go out to lunch i alway see cop come in the majority that i see be still carry revolver not that there be anything wrong with a revolver but if you a cop that be up against some gang member with a couple of automatic in hi coat i mean semi-auto handgun you go to be at a disadvantage even with train i have be at a shoot range where gang gang member be practice shoot they be actually practice take out their gun a quick a possible and shoot at the target and they be do too badly either the university cop here who be be state cop be arm better than the chicago polouse it seem most state cop be every city and suburban polouse officer i see around the twin city in the last two year ha carry a semi-auto of some type different brand though i have see any glock with regard to thi discussion we be get dangerously far from the usual rant of and close to the realm of but i like to put my two cent worth in while there nothing wrong with a revolver especially a large frame s w in magnum my favorite there be valid advantage to semi-auto i suggest read massad ayoob i know some person ca stand him and think he full of bull but i think that in general hi material be very valid and useful book the semi auto pistol in polouse work or something like that he define a number of way that semi-auto be different and that different be good the main advantage be not in increase firepower but in more accurate followup shoot when you go to single action mode there be also a certain propriatory nature of each gun that take some familiarity to learn thi may have diminish with time a more criminal become familiar with different model of semi-auto but it wa cite a stop or at least slow down criminal who have grab a polouse officer gun define arm better go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the colt do one fire faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire be usually not desirable sure it make the other guy duck for cover but just you try hit anything with a thompson in hose-mode thi be why the military be limit it now to burst-fire simple semi-auto would be better but the troop like to be able to rock and roll even if it be wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy be plentiful a revolver be equally capable a a semi-auto in the same caliber a revolver also ha the advantage that if it misfire you just pull the trigger again a double-action revolver almost all of them can be hand-cocked first but will fire merely by pull the trigger ye but thi be best do with a two hand hold with a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action the da semi auto ha the same advantage plu be alway sa after the first shoot a misfire in a revolver merely mean you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round i not sure if thi be mean to be different from ymy first point in a da semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try drop the hammer on the same round an advantage you do have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will alway go to the next round discuss thi point now thi be fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation granted it very rare but ymy round will now go off confine in the cylinder with no place to go slingshotting the slide on a misfire take very little time a revolver can be carry with the chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be draw and fire with an easy motion even one hand actually with modern revolver design incorporate hammer block thi be not necessary or usually recommend a revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the fire pin into the round to set it off speedloader for a revolver allow reload almost a fast a magazine on semi-auto can be faster depend on user the best speedloader user especially those use the spring load speed loader be very fast a problem be that eject the spend case be a two hand job where drop the expend magazine be one hand thi mean that while you can be insert a fresh magazine a soon a the old one clear the gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motion that will alway take more time you also do have the advantage of tactical reload replace a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the partial magazine can still be use if need later a misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jam shell first time spend which can be fatal and a vital second or so be often lose a you realize hey it jam before start to do anything about clear it ye the time to recognize the problem be just a important a the time to clear it really though in either a revolver or semi-auto the odd of an actual misfire with factory ammo be awfully small you be more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these be exceptionally rare with modern quality gun sig glock most semi-auto must have the slide work to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some polouse carry their semi-auto with the chamber load and hammer cock but a safety engage i do not consider thi safe however you must trade-off safety to get the same speed of employment a a revolver there be some double-action semi-auto out there but the complexity of operation of many of them require more train all common semi-auto can be carry with a round in their chamber without any safety problem while i put that out a a statement that i believe i should say that thi apply to all of the one i look at for the da semi it no different from the revolver situation the gun all have hammer or fire pin block they also have a safety because there no real advantage carry one of these cock and lock you have the same safety and speed of employment a a revolver plu the advantage of sa followup shoot i not familiar with sa semi-auto except for the i admit that i wa initially skeptical about carry thi cock and lock but after examine the design try to defeat the safety gun unload of course and shoot it a lot i see no inherent safety problem with it especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer thi design also get you more speed for an accurate first shoot than a revolver some polouse department switch to glock and then start quietly switch many officer back to the old revolver too many be have accident partly due to the poor train they receive not that glock require rocket scientist but some cop be baffle by something a complex a the timer on a vcr yeah the infamou glock i still ca figure out how it worse than a revolver for safety if you do pull the trigger it do go off i imagine that if all ymy revolver shoot wa do double action then you could pull the glock trigger far enough to fire before you realize it in addition if you have develop that nasty habit of keep ymy finger on the trigger when holstering ymy gun and rely on ymy thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blow off ymy foot then you have problem when the hammer wa there anyone who go anyone say that the criminal obviously outgun the polouse do know nothing about firearm turn off cop and hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say semi-auto be junk merely that assume they be better for all job be stupid a cop with a revolver on hi hip and a shotgun in the rack be more than equip for anything short of a riot i think thi be even okay for a riot a long a it a small one b gun control be hit what you aim at if you whip out a wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you do hit anything good control fire from a revolver be more likely to get you a hit i own a berettum myself but consider it inferior a a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i have hit what i aim at in the first shoot something be quite seriously wrong somewhere while i might like have the backup capacity of those extra shoot in certain case overwhelmingly the of shoot fire in criminal encounter be le than i have the poor man berettum tauru and consider it inferior a a carry weapon to the springfield oop v argument be relegate to you be right though if you do hit what you aim at then the combination ha fail i do ascribe failure in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun thi be a shooter failure whether through lack of discipline or lack of train what do crook overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple revolver that the polouse often use well actually some polouse prefer the much heftier magnum but anyway be become more popular with crook too though the do still lead the list and like i say around here semi-auto seem the rule for the street cop do know about the state patrol however they may still carry the highway patrolman obplea do flame me i prefer semi-auto for most thing but they introduce unneccessary complication to something a nerve-wracking a an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal vincent please do take any of thi a a flame just my whoop look more like worth and much of it be imho but do check ayoob book if everything have go a plan everything would have be perfect batf spokesperson on cnn regard fail raid attempt in tx
