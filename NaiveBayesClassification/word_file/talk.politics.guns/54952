from kratz jason kratz subject re criminal machinegun in andy andy freeman write in article jason kratz write person be get kill by gang violence every day every single day i hear about more person get kill by gang violence and see some of the weapon that be be confiscate is kratz claim that he can reliably visually distinguish an from an that he can see the difference between a semi-auto and a full-auto uzi that he can see the difference between the variou version some full-auto some semi-auto only of the well let me see uzi no no maybe i remember there be a selector swtich on the if i remember correctly please correct me if i wrong the switch would set to an off position or an on position because the gun be semi-automatic would the have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire or maybe round burst if thi be correct would it be easy to distinguish each gun by thi alone of course if the be modify to full-auto fire i would think it would be that easy but i talk about distinguish between an unmodified and how about the other gun do they also have selector switch to switch between semi-auto and fully-auto fire if so i love to hear the detail if only because they demonstrate that kratz be blow smoke considering that one can design a gun so that it look just like another gun yet have very different property and that that quite common most kid in my neighborhood be quite young when they figure out that my parent car wa much like richard petty even though it look just like it except for the paint job thing must have be different with kratz actually it wa pretty hard for the kid in my neighborhood to figure that out a richard petty live in my neighborhood and leave hi stock car in the driveway sure it on tv but why do that make a difference no it do but that irrelevant if visual inspection of the outside work tv would be acceptable but since it do the fact that it just a good a see in person do mean much well what about what i say above if that be correct i gues tv would be acceptable if you have a good enough picture and a picture of the lower receiver of the andy give kratz a chance to back down on thi in private jason kratz do take andy offer to back down in private
