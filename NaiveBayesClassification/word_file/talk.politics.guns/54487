from dnewcomb donald r newcomb subject re some more about gun control first i would like to say how much i appreciate have so literate and erudite an individual a mr rutledge with whom to discus thi topic frankly most anti-rkba poster refuse even to approach the topic of the original understand of the bill of right a detail in the write of the era thi be most refresh second i must apologize for leave the discussion for several day my brigade quarterly drill wa thi weekend and i need to attend to several matter pertain to the state militium some person seem to feel that the concept of the militium be an anachro nism that be out of place in the century i not sure the swiss would agree and i think perhap a discussion of how the militium both organize and unorganized fit into the defense plan of my state mississippus please do not assume that thi describe something peculiar to one southern state for instance the commonwealth of massachusett ha a well organize militium which member report maintain stock of both riot gun and machine gun the law of other state will vary but be probably similar title of mississippus code define my militium a all able-bodied citizen of the state between the age of seventeen and sixty two year the militium be divide into class the national guard the mississippus state guard and the unorganized militium the national guard be a strange sort of fish from a constitutional perspective it try to be both state militium and federal reserve the discussion of thi para-constitutional arrangement be quite interest in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of thi discussion suffice it that at thi date the national guard ha cease to have any constitutional stand a anything but a federal reserve force mississippus and most other state maintain a purely state organize militium in mississippus thi be call the state guard in other state it may be call something else the state guard exist a a cadre or train corp make up of mostly experience officer and senior nco who serve a volunteer without compensation we drill on a monthly basi at the company and battalion level brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization my state-authorized cadre strength be thi be a skeleton of an organization without any flesh the muscle and sinew when need will come from the unorganized militium in time of invasion insurrection or calamity the governor can order the activation of the state guard when thi take place a call will first be make for volunteer to fill the organization out to either it contingency strength of or full strength of in the event that a sufficient number of person fail to volunteer the law provide detail instruction for the conduct of a draft of the unorganized militium the size of the state guard be not specify by law but rather by executive order at one time the organize militium of mississippus consist of regiment needles to say the state do not have armory brim with weapon with which to equip such a force the historical precedent for arm such a force be by use of mostly the private arm of the militiaman it be my hope that demonstrate that state militia be far from be the long dead anachronism that some may wish to claim no i simple state that the person have a right to join a well organize militium and i have also state that a militium that meet once or twice a year be clearly well organize and thi state of readines that i have claim the person have a right to be the same state of readines expect of the militium a state by hamilton regarding hamilton if you take hamilton opinion a be the sole representative of the opinion of the founding father you will have choose a highly skew sample set hamilton wa on the extreme federalist end of the political spectrum other such a coxe and henry can be choose to represent the other end many contemporary felt that the idea of have a stand army of any sort or even a select militium or train band be contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern ment they be strive to perfect the compromise reach wa to provide for a small army which have to be refinance every two year and iron-clad protection for the militium which wa to remain ever terrible and irresistible these protection include state control not federal limitation of federal utilization of the militium execute law suppres insurrection and repel invasion and the right to keep and bear arm to prevent what the british have try to do at lexington these limitation eventually prove so onerou to the federal govern ment that they be skirt by the creation of the national guard the national guard wa create for one very simple reason the constitutional militium wa have prove too unreliable for fight war of imperial expansion spanish-american war the constitution provide that the militium could only be employ by the federal government in very limit purpose a far back a the war of militium unit have refuse to leave united state territory to attack the enemy further there wa no constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the federal military and militiaman be particularly protect in all war until ww-i every american who leave the country under arm wa a volunteer when the national guard act of require that each new member also enlist a a reservest in the army exist soldier be grandfathered at least one of these grandfathered individual refuse to go to france in and hi refusal wa uphold by the federal court mr rutledge ha state that the second amendment apply only to member of a well organize militium however the pre-constitutional history of the american militium show relatively few period when the militium come close to meet either messr rutledge or hamilton definition of well organize in the period of peace between the french indian war and the revolution many company simply stop drill and have to be reconstitute just prior to the revolution perhap mr rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestor who answer the lexington alarm have forfeit their right because their unit do drill for a few year in the i would not be so bold again i wish to repeat the national guard for all it merit be not the militium describe by the constitution nor by mr hamilton nor by mr henry nor by mr coxe the fact that the federal government and many state be delinquent in their attention to and organize of their constitutional militia diminish neither their responsibility nor the right of the militium a detail in the constitution misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the militium be but one error that ha creep into modern read of the constitution the constitution prohibit state from keep troop or ship of war in time of peace i have hear some insist thi prevent state from maintain a militium but thi come about because person today do not understand the mean of the word in their century usage today we call any large vessel a ship but in the century the word describe a particular kind of vessel a ship be a large vessel with three or more mast each carry square rig sail a brig ha two mast in the contemporary usage the state be prohibit only from keep the largest warship of the day those capable of global operation today equivalent might be a prohibition on the state keep nuclear missile troop at thi time mean a full-time professional military organization any study of contemporaneou write will bear thi out in at least one respect i be in agreement with mr rutledge be personally involve in the maintenance and advancement of the militium a a viable mean of defense for a modern society i be frequently both bemuse and sadden when friend and associate wax poetic on their place in the unorganized militium and become strangely silent or scarce when invite to attend a drill of their state militium donald r newcomb university of southern mississippus dnewcomb thi be the way we tax and spend tax dnewcomb and spend we democrat in office
