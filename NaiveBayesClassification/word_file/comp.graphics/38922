from torgeir veimo subject virtual sound i look for algorithm or article on virtual sound what i want to do be the follow from a fast source eg a cdrom several sound source be read each have it own define position and other attribute eg direction etc given the listener position and direction the sum of sound play back in each of the listener earphone will be a function of thi position and direction thi mean that some simulation of the ear color of sound relative to it incoming direction have to be do for each sound source i think thi be possible to do with a lookup table of impulse response for several angle relative to each ear and interpolate an impulse function from thi for a give angle thi impulse function could then be convolute with the sound from the source thi impulse function must be change every time some sound source change position or the listener change orientation additionally some reflection diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich be define could be simulate but thi require some sort of sound propagandation simulation kinda like some radiosity algorithm have someone do thi write article on implement such a system please post or mail any answer or comment torgeir veimo studying at the university of bergen i gona wave my freak flag high jimi hendrix and it would be okay on any other day the polouse
