from spworley steve worley subject re sphere from point bolson edward bolson write boy thi will be embarassing if it be trivial or an faq given point non coplanar how do one find the sphere that be center and radiu exactly fit those point i know how to do it for a circle from point but do not immediately see a straightforward way to do it in i have check some geometry book graphic gem and farin but be still at a los please have mercy on me and provide the solution it not a bad question i do have any ref that list thi algorithm either but think about it a bite it should be too hard take three of the point and find the plane they define a well a the circle that they lie on you say you have thi algorithm already find the center of thi circle the line pass through thi center perpendicular to the plane of the three point pas through the center of the sphere repeat with the unused point and two of the original point thi gife you two different line that both pa through the sphere origin their interection be the center of the sphere the radiu be easy to compute it just the distance from the center to any of the original point i leave the math to you but thi be a workable algorithm an alternate method would be to take pair of point the plane form by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contain the center of the sphere three pair will form three plane intersect at a point thi might be easier to implement steve spworley
