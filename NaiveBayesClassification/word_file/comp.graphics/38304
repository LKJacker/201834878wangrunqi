from mogal joshua mogal subject re sgi sale practice wa crimson wa kubotum announcement my comment regard dec wa to indicate that i might be open to other vendor that support opengl rather than deal further with sgi opengl be a graphic program library and a such be a great portable interface for the development of interactive graphic application it be not however an indicator of performance a that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi be commit to high performance interactive graphic system and software tool so opengl mean that you can port easily from sgi to other platform there be no guarantee that ymy performance would be comparable what i be annoy about be the fact that we be lead to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck if ymy sale representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against u which you should carry up to ymy local sgi sale management team feel free to contact the local branch manager we understand that repeat sale come from satisfy customer so give it a shoot i also annoy about be sell several personal irise at a previou site on the understand that architecture would be around for a while rather than be flush a one of the previou post state the personal iri wa introduce in and grow to include the and a clock rate speed up over time a a rule of thumb sgi platform live for about year thi wa true of the motorola-based series the pus the professional series the early the power series parallel system individual cpu subsystem run at a particular clock rate usually live for about year new graphic architecture at the high end gt vgx realityengine be release every month to year these be the fact of life if we look at these machine they become almost archaic after fmy year and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which ha higher bu bandwidth faster cpu faster graphic and and larger disk capacity if we do we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meet ymy current need and make economic sense today you ca wait to buy but if you need a guarantee upgrade path for the machine ask the sale rep for one in write if it feasible they should be able to do that some of my upgrade path have specific program associate with them such a the performance protection program for older power series multiprocessing system which allow purchaser of those system to obtain a guarantee upgrade price for move to the new onyx or challenge multiprocessor system now i understand that sgi be responsible to it investor and ha to keep show a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i find myself pressure on at least two occasion to get the busines on the book just before the end of the quarter but i just a little tire of get bone in the proces if that happen it becausing of misunderstand or mis-communication not because sgi be directly attempt to annoy my customer base maybe it because my lab buy sgi in onesy and twosy so we be entitle to a peek under the cover a the big kid nasa for instance be thi lab and i suspect that a lot of other lab and organization do have a load of money to spend on computer every year so we ca be out buy new system on a regular basi most sgi customer be onesy-twosey type but regardles we rarely give a great deal of notice when we be about to introduce a new system because again like a previou post state if we pre-announced and the schedule slip we would me up my potential customer schedule when they be count on the availability of the new system on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both my investor and the financial analyst who watch u most carefully to see if we be meet my commitment the box that we buy now will have to last u pretty much through the entire grant period of five year and in some case beyond that mean that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that wa build to paraphrase one previou poster word fill a niche to compete with some other vendor i go to be look at thi box for the next five year and every time i look at it i go to think about sgi and how i could have better spend my money actually ymy money since we support almost entirely by federal tax dollar five year be an awfully long time in computer year new processor technology be arrive every year make a year old computer at least and probably generation behind the time the competitive nature of the market be demand that rate of development so if ymy time be really year between purchase you have to accept the limit viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there be some reality about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keep customer happy be the most important so do give up we know it josh joshua mogal product manager advanced graphic division advanced graphic system silicon graphic
