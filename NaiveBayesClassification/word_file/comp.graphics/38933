conference be plan for march phig everywhere at the conference phig vendor describe and demonstrate phig product that run on all type of computer from pc to mainframe megatek corporation demonstrate their phig extension include conditional traversal composite logical input device texturing and translucency template graphic software launch figaro pro the photo realistic option for phig figaro pro be design to add advance render to the exist phig apus with feature like ray trace material anti-aliasing and texture map radiosity support be also plan figaro be an example of how tg continue to add newly emerge graphic feature to their product figaro support immediate mode extension to phig and also support sun xgl hp starbase and sgi figaro for nt will be release thi summer tg also demonstrate the latest version of figraph a powerful chart system base on phig and figt an object orient utility library for developer and gallium software demonstrate a new version of gphig on silicon graphic workstation scheduled for summer ver sion of gphig the company phig library for workstum tion will include an advance phig debugger that allow phig developer to display and browse phig structure and other phig internal state also describe their non-duplicated datum store that store pointer to application datum in the gphig cs for more efficient use of memory in addition describe their application gse that allow application callback function during gphig traversal gphig and phigure datum visual izer and application development toolkit be currently available on all major workstation that support gl x window pex or starbase wise software present a slide show of z-phig for ms-window and arena a phig base z-phig implement most of the phig primitive in addition z-phig ha build in many advance render feature like texture map shadow genus tion area quick update and ray trace a demo disk of z-phig or arena be available on request atc exhibit grafpak-phig their full-featured phig impleman tation base on dec phig grafpak-phig be available on most workstation platform with c fortran and ada bind and incor porate pex support within the booth sponsor by advanced technology center digital
