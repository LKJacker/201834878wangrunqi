from srp stephen pietrowicz subject surface normal orientation some render program require that all surface normal point in the same direction ie on a close cube all normal point outward you can use the point on the face to determine the direction of the normal by make sure that all point be either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order how do you go about orient all normal in the same direction give a set of point edge and face say that you have a cube with all face that have their normal face outward except for one face what the best way to realize that face be flip and should have it point re-ordered i think i have a good way of tell thi but then realize that the algorithm i have would only tell you if you have point in clockwise order for a polygon i like something for datum any hint tip reference would be appreciate steve where humor be concern there be no standard no one can say what be good or bad although you can be sure that everyone will john kenneth galbraith these opinion be my own
