from kouhium juhana subject re xv problem in article write ye xv be an bite program thi be not a bug never claim it be a bug xv can import bite image and quantise them down to bite thi be a handy facility not a bug never claim it be a bug how would you suggest do colmy edit on a bite file how would you group colour to edit them together only global change could be do unles the software be very different and much more complicate if you want to do colmy edit on a bite image you need much more powerfull software which be readily available commercially i gues i edit my note on thi away from the article i post to many newsgroup i write something about make color modification quickly with quantize image and only at the save the image to file proces we have to make the modification to the image thi make sense because the main use of xv be only view image doing many change to image we should keep all modification in a buffer and then before make the operation to image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operation and lastly jpeg be a compression algorithm it can be apply to any image of arbitrary bite depth again thi be not a bug never claim it be a bug i try keep sure i do claim that jpeg be note else than a compression algorithm because i know what the jpeg be you propably misunderstand what i write a you have do in many place so far you also miss what be be wrong with xv however i do write it juhana kouhium
