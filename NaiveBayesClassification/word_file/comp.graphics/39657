from fitz bob fitzsimmon subject re vga graphic library in article bill bill sheppard write many high-end graphic card come with c source code for do basic graphic sort of thing change color draw etc do such a library exist for generic vga graphic hopefully in the public domain thi would be for the purpose of compile under a non-do operate system run on a standard pc i also interest in info both public domain and commercial graphic library package to do pc vga graphic i currently work on a realtime application run on a pcc with a non-do kernel that need to do some simple graphic i not sure if reentrancy of the graphic library be go to be an issue or not i suspect i implement the display controller a a server proces that handle graphic request queue on a mailbox one at a time if thi provide sufficiently frequent display update then i believe that i can restrict all graphic operation to be perform by the server and thu constrain acces to the library to a thi single proces and avoid the need for a reentrant graphic library being fairly new to the realtime system world i may be overlook something what do you think cheer bob fitzsimmon fitz
