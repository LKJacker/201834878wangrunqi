from roy roy smith subject re why do illustrator autotrace so poorly mac richard j mcdougald write since there no not really such thing a a decent raster to vector conversion program thi trace technique be about it simple stuff like b w logo etc do pretty well while more complicate stuff go haywire the first and only thing i ever try to auto-trace wa a piece of a uscg nautical chart use adobe illustrator i want to get the outline of the coast for western long island sound i wa simultaneously suprised at how good a job it do and disappoint at how poorly it do i suspect what i give it wa a very difficult thing not only be the coastline very irregular but overlay on the chart be numerou set of gridline not only lattitude and longitude but loran grid a well the most common mistake it make wa whenever the coastline wa roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line it would take off follow the gridline instead of the coast i think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say no dummy you go the wrong way steve reisberg a friend of mine a few year back do hi doctoral work analyse electron micrograph of filimentou phage virius a good chunk of the work wa write a program to take a digitize micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the viru particle thi be essentially the same problem that illustrator try to solve with it auto-trace tool in some respect the problem steve work on wa harder since he wa try to do quantitative analysi of the viru structure and find a good centerline wa only the first step but a step on which all future analysi depend however in other respect it wa an easier problem since the program could be write with a lot of knowledge about what the viru particle be suppose to look like and the analysi could be restrict to those particle which happend to be relatively straight clean and well image you do alway have that freedom auto-tracing real life image in any case it give me some insight into just how difficult thi problem be to solve in the general case steve be no longer with u he and hi wife disappear while on vacation in hawaius a couple of year after they graduate their last know location wa hike in a densely wooded in a mountainou area while no body be ever find they be presume to have be the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the wood roy smith roy hippocrate project department of microbiology cole nyu school of medicine first avenue new york ny thi never happen to bart simpson
