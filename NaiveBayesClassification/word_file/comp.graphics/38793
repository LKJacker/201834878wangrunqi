from jesse jesse lackey subject re fast polygon routine need in article alan alan christiansen write i believe that the algorithm you can get that will only draw convex polygon can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave self intersect polygon thi efficiency can largely be attribute to the fact that simple convex polygon only have a leave and a right edge on each scan line complex figure type polygon can be a bite trickier it be true the convex algorithm be faster than a general outline algorithm but not tremendously faster i spend awhile implement and optimize both flavor and the convex turn out about faster thi be all c on hp pa-risc the compiler get the inner loop shoot the span a fast a possible a far a i could tell for any sort of game the database to render be know ahead of time and can be make all convex definitely the way to go sorry but my code can not be make public domain jesse jesse lackey inc ithaca ny jesse
