from abig acces bu industry gp subject re software creator contest intro to re the software creator contest announcement what is be a new open industry standard for computer peripheral connectivity be a serial protocol that use simple low-cost technology to link multiple device to a single pc port peripheral device such a keyboard or keypad locator mouse trackball joystick printer vr glove digitizer sensor actuator or datum transmitter and other can be easily daisy chain to the host pc application such a datum acquisition simulation virtual reality pc game education and many many more can now take advantage of the technology that put plug and play on every pc the offer advantage to end-user and developer of system and peripheral multiple device connect to the host computer with only one port common communication method for a number of device type lead to simplify hardware and software development a an open standard enable cro platform use of the same device technological description technology be an open specification enable anyone to implement it on host system or in peripheral device without fee or royalty ha a bu topology architecture that be a single host can accommodate up to peripheral device datum rate be physical layer be a serial bu architecture base on hardware protocol with one datum line and one clock line standard low-cost microcontroller handle bit-level handshaking include automatic arbitration and clock synchronization software protocol the communication protocol be compose of three level protocol base protocol and application protocol protocol thi simple and efficient protocol define arbitration among contend master without lose datum provide for cooperative synchronization of bu partner with different clock rate bu transaction include address frame of bite into byte and byte acknowledgment by the receiver base protocol establish the asymmetrical interconnect between a host computer and multiple peripheral the host become the manager the base protocol define the format of an message envelope which be an bu transaction with additional semantic include checksum unique feature of the base protocol be auto-addressing and hot plug auto-addressing assign device with unique bu address without the need for set jumper or switch hot plug be the ability to attach and detach device while the system be run without reboot application protocol thi be the highest level of the protocol which define message semantic specific to particular type of device each type require a different application protocol three broad device type have be identify keyboard locator and text device support on the pc all three level of the protocol be support on the pc an add-on card implement the physical layer and use the base protocol to communicate with physical device an manager tsr under do and a dll under window control the operation of the physical layer and interact with the device driver driver be available for multiple keyboard locator and printer for do and window also available be c language source code example of the interface from application to the device driver to contact abig the industry group postal addres altair way suite sunnyvale ca internet email abig fax voice
