from osprey luca adamski subject re fast polygon routine need in article idr ian d romanick write what kind of polygon shaded texturemapped hm more come into play with fast routine than just polygon it would be nice to know exaclty what system vga be a start but what processor and a few of the specific of the implementation you need to give more info if you want to get any answer p i do want texture map cause if i do i ask for them just a simple and fast routine to do fill polygon a for the processor it be for a minimum of a maybe if i ca find a good one for ideally i want a polyn function that can clip to a user-defined viewport and write to an arbitrary location in memory of course the chance of find something like that be pretty remote so i gues i need the source with it oh and i gues it would need to be in asm otherwise it be too slow i see some polygon routine in c and they all be waaay too slow it for a vector graphic program i be hunt high and low for a polyn function in asm and i ca find one anywhere that i can use i find one or two polyn function but my asm be pretty bad so i wo even try to rewrite them luca
