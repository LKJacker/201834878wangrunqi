from simon marshall subject how do i compensate for photographic viewpoint and distortion hi to all out there we have thi problem and i not certain i solve it in the correct way i wa wonder if anyone can shed light on thi or point me in the right place to look we have an x-ray image camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole pass through it at a right angle to the tube axi image x-ray source screen metallic tube we know source screen centre distance radiu of the tube radiu of the hole we do some calculation base on the image of the hole on the screen however the calculation be mathematically highly complex and must assume that the object hole project an image resemble an ellipse if the tube be not parallel to the screen in the centre of the screen however it be unlikely that the object be place so conveniently firstly we must transform the major and minor axi of the ellipse i can not know what the angle between the tube and screen be do i have to assume that they be parallel to do the transformation how do i do thi transformation secondly there be a distortion of the image due to the screen be planar the source screen distance increase a we move away from the centre of the screen how can i compensate the ellipse axi for thi image distortion so please can anyone give u a few pointer here how do we transform the image so it appear a it would if it be in the centre of the screen and how do i deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen we appreciate any help either post or email thank in advance simon simon marshall dept of computer science university of hull hull uk football be about life and death it more important than that bill email phone fax shankley
