from alan alan christiansen subject re sphere from point spworley steve worley write bolson edward bolson write boy thi will be embarassing if it be trivial or an faq given point non coplanar how do one find the sphere that be center and radiu exactly fit those point i know how to do it for a circle from point but do not immediately see a straightforward way to do it in i have check some geometry book graphic gem and farin but be still at a los please have mercy on me and provide the solution it not a bad question i do have any ref that list thi algorithm either but think about it a bite it should be too hard take three of the point and find the plane they define a well a the circle that they lie on you say you have thi algorithm already find the center of thi circle the line pass through thi center perpendicular to the plane of the three point pas through the center of the sphere repeat with the unused point and two of the original point thi gife you two different line that both pa through the sphere origin their interection be the center of the sphere the radiu be easy to compute it just the distance from the center to any of the original point i leave the math to you but thi be a workable algorithm good i have a bad feel about thi problem because of a special case with no solution that worry me fmy coplanar point in the shape of a square have no unique sphere that they be on the surface of similarly colinear point have no finite size sphere that they be on the surface of these algorithm be geometrical design rather than algebraically design meet these problem neatly when determine which plane the point be on if they be colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite r when intersect the two line there be possibility they be the same line the point be on a planar circle they be different line but parallel there be a sphere of in radiu thi last case can be achieve with colinier point and any point by take the point and pair of the first parallel line will be produce it can also be achieve by if all point be coplanar but be not on one circle it seem to me that the algorithm only fail when the point be coplanar the algorithm alway fail when the point be coplanar point be colinear coplanar testing if the point be coplanar when the plane of the first point ha be find be trivial an alternate method would be to take pair of point the plane form by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contain the center of the sphere three pair will form three plane intersect at a point thi might be easier to implement steve spworley
