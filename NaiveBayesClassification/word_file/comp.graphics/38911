from gvanvugh gerhard van vught subject re viewing jpeg file in lwilson write can i view jpeg file without special hardware lucy wilson acces service librarian college of engineering university of cincinnatus yup most jpeg viewer seem to require specific video driver since they support only specific video card some have the standard ibm bio video support for the vga colmy mode but they leave out the other card such a the hercule monochrome card which by the way can give very good picture quality if ymy dither work right i ca remember the name of a jpeg viewer since i usually convert jpeg to gif before view them but some require vesa driver for the video card you do need any special hardware to view jpeg except perhap for a vga card and maybe a processor most person these day program for computer and neglect the rest of the processor i have a clone a nec processor and a hercule card i have have to write some program so that they will view gif and animation for the vga and other colmy graphic board on my monochrome hercule card i use floyd-steinberg dither and have find that if one do something neat with the colmy palette the result dither image gife much greater detail than it normally would when view on other monochrome system compushow ha f dither but it do the standard thing with the image palette before dither my way gife a brighter more detail image anyway enough of my ramble in the wrong direction the final point be a far a i know you do need extra hardware to view jpeg other than the vga and perhap a or better have a day gerry
