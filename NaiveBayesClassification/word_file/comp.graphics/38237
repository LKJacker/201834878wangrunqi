from stefan stefan eckart subject info another do mpeg post i have post a do mpeg to here be a short description and some technical information take from the accompany documentation dmpeg public domain mpeg decoder by stefan eckart feature be another mpeg for the pc decode nearly the full mpeg video standard i p b frame frame size up to at least support save decode sequence in or raw file for later display optional on-screen display during decode require vga several dither option order dither floyd-steinberg grayscale color-space selection run under do ram no ms-window require very compact small code small datum model bite arithmetic real time display of the raw file by a separate player for vga and many super-vga technical information the player be a rather straightforward implementation of the mpeg spec the idct be base on the chen-wang multiplication algorithm not quite the optimum i know block with not more than eight non-zero coefficient use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate sound great do it which turn out to be faster than a algorithm in thi quite common case dithering be pretty standard main difference to the berkeley decoder except for the fewer number of support algorithm be the use of instead of color the default option to use a restrict color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant order dither thi lead to a significantly superior quality of the dither image i claim judge yourself restricted color-space mean that the u and v component be clip to instead of and the display color-space point be distribute over thi restrict space since the distance between color-space point be thu reduce by a factor of two the color resolution be double at the expense of not be able to represent fully saturate color saturation dominant order dither be a method by which a color lie somewhere between the point of the display color space be approximate by primarily alternate between two point of constant hue instead of constant saturation thi yield subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human view system to saturation change than to hue change the same reason a use by the pal tv standard to improve on ntsc the improvement be particularly visible in dark brown or redish area stefan eckart stefan
