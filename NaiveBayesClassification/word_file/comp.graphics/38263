from davidr david j ray subject re fractal what good be they in regard to fractal commpression i have see fractal compress movie they be both fairly impressive the first one wa a gray scale movie of casablanca it wa and have minute of fp video it wa a little grainy but not bad at all the second one i saw wa only minute but it have bite color with and measure in at i consider the fractal movie a practical thing to explore but unlike many other format out there you do end up lose resolution i do know what kind of wa use for create the movie i saw but the guy that show them to me say it take minute per frame to generate but a i say above playback wa or more frame per second and how else could you put minute on one floppy disk davidr my opinion be my own except where they be share by other in which case i will probably change my mind
