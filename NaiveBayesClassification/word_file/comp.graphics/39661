from mckinley chuck mckinley subject ray-bezier intersection problem if some kind person ha acces to a mathematical package such a mathematica maple i would like to ask you for the solution to the follow problem i sometime have algebra problem like thi where i would like a simplify symbolic solution is there a ftp-able package out there that can handle such beast i would like to solve the follow ray bezier patch intersection for the scalar constant t in p t v q u w origin point in dir vector in term of only p v p and variou scalar origin dir i j i j where t q u w u n b m w n u u u u u u u u u u in my particular case n t w w w w w w w t w w w in my particular case t n m for my particular case b p p p p control point in space p p p p p p p p p p p p thanx chuck
