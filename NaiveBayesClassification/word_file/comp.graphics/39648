from eric davi icend subject re help in article stephenc say in studio be there any way to create refraction diffraction etc i want to simulate such thing a glas lens bottle etc there might be an ipa routine that do that but i be sure another way to do it be to render the scene without the glas object and save the image then assign that image to ymy glas object a a reflection it will take a lot of adjust for position and size of the reflection but that the only thing i can think of
