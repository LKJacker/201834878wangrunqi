you can call them at or email care of greg host configuration requirement if you be will to run you could install gras on a macintosh which ha significant image analysi and import capability for satellite datum gras be public-domain and can run on a high-end pc under unix it be raster-based ha some image-processing capability and can display vector datum but analysi must be do in the raster

i forget the software be available in version for ms-do unix workstation among them hp sun and ibm and vm and quite possibly other platform by now i use the vm version the pcus software consist of several of utility group by function but all operate on a common pcus database disk file the tape package be a set of utility program which read from the variou remote-sensing industry tape format into or write those format out from the pcus database file thi be the only package i use or know much about other package can display datum from the pcus database to one or another of several pci-supported third-party color display output numeric or bitmap representation of image datum to an attach printer an epson-type dot-matrix graphic printer you might be more spe cifically interest in the mathematical operation package histo gram and fourier analysi equalization user-specified operation multiply channel by add channel and store a channel and god only know what all else there a lot i do have and do use these so ca say much about them you only buy the package ymy particular call for each utility be control by from one to eight parameter read from a common parameter file which must be in vm anyway in ymy default directory some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bite confuse set up a series of operation the standard pcus environment contain a script language very similar to ibm-pc basic but which allow you to automate the proces of set up parameter for a common complicate lengthy or difficult series of utility execution in vm i can also invoke utility independently from a dcl command procedure there also an optional program library which allow you to write compile language program which can interface with read to the pcus datum structure database file parameter file the pcus software be design specifically for remote-sensing image but require such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r- image you can figure out way to handle a few other thing a well for instance the tape package offer a utility for read headerles multi-band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh call raw datum from tape in a number of different interleave order thi turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic-art industry format would probably i have try handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it worth note that the pcus database file be design to contain not only raster image datum but vector for overlay map information enter vium digitize table land-use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote-sensing image tape often contain all manner of information about the spectral band latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pa all of thi can go into the pcus database i believe that on workstation the built-in display be use on vax system other than workstation pcus support only a couple of specific third-party display system the name seem to come to mind one of my personal workaround wa a display program which would display directly from a pcus database file to a peritek vct-q q-bu directcolor display subsystem pcus software could be overkill in ymy case it seem design for the very high end those for whom a largely do suffice although a you know the gap be get smaller all the time it probably no coincidence that pcus be locate in canada a country which do a lot of it management vium remote sense i believe the canadian government use pcus software for some of it work in these area spam spectral analysi manager back in jpl develop something call spam spectral analysi manager which get a fair amount of use at the time that wa design for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte datum pixel acros by line by band a modify version ha since be develop for aviri airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer which use much larger image spam do none of these thing rectification classification pc and ih transformation filter contrast enhancement overlay actually it do limit filter and contrast enhancement stretch spam be aim at spectral identification and cluster the original spam use x or sunview to display the aviri version may require vicar an executive base on ta and may also require a frame buffer i can refer you to person if you interest pcw require x for display map ius among the mac gi system map ius be distribute by john wiley clrview clrview be a visualization program design to exploit the real-time capability of silicon graphic iri computer thi program be design to provide a core set of tool to aid in the visualization of information from cad and gi source it support the integration of many common but disperate datum source such a dxf tin dem lattice and coverage among other clrview can be obtain from in the directory contact rodney hoinke head of design application
