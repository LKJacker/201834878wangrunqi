from bob bob dougla subject re sphere from point in article steve hcrlgw steven collin write in article bolson edward bolson write boy thi will be embarassing if it be trivial or an faq given point non coplanar how do one find the sphere that be center and radiu exactly fit those point i know how to do it for a circle from point but do not immediately see a straightforward way to do it in i have check some geometry book graphic gem and farin but be still at a los please have mercy on me and provide the solution would thi require a hyper-sphere in point over specify a sphere a far a i can see unles that be you can prove that a point exist in that be equi-distant from the point and thi may not necessarily happen correct me if i wrong which i quite possibly be steve sorry call the fmy point a b c and d any three of them must be non-collinear otherwise all three could not lie on the surface of a sphere and all fmy must not be coplaner otherwise either they can not all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them a b and c define a circle the perpendicular bisector of ab bc and ca meet in a point p say which be the centre of thi circle thi circle must lie on the surface of the desire sphere consider the normal to the plane abc pass through p all point on thi normal be equidistant from a b and c and it circle in fact it be a diameter of the desire sphere take the plane contain thi normal and d if d ly on the normal any plane contain the normal will do thi plane be at right angle to the abc one let e be the point there be normally two of them on the circumference of the abc circle which ly in thi plane we need a point q on the normal such that eq dq but the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ed and the normal be such a point and it exist since d be not in the plane abc and so ed be not at right angle to the normal algorithm is the sphere well define check that a and b be not coincident failure find the line ab and check that c do not lie on it failure find the plane abc and check that d do not lie in it failure ye find it centre find the perpendicular bisector of ab and ac find their point of intersection p find the normal to the plane abc pass through p line n find the plane contain n and d find the point e on the abc circle in thi plane if d ly on n take e a a find the perpendicular bisector of ed line l find the point of intersection of n and l q q be the centre of the desire sphere picture in the plane abc a p b c at right-angle to abc in the plane contain n and d e d line n p q numerically if ed ep then q will be very close to p relative to the radiu of the abc circle and subject to error it best to choose d so that the least of ad bd and cd be larger than for any other choice bob dougla computing service university of oxford internet bob addres banbury road oxford uk telephone
