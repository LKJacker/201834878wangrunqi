from gavin gavin bell subject re surface normal orientation in aqe srp stephen pietrowicz write how do you go about orient all normal in the same direction give a set of point edge and face thi algorithm work well for me algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normal first mark all face a unknown then create an edge dictionary that allow you to find all of the face share a give edge where an edge be two integer represent the two share vertex pick an arbitrary face and mark it using the edge dictionary orient all surround face base on the orientation of thi face and recurse for all surround face consistently orient the entire surface find the average of the vertex in thi surface using that point calculate a volume measurement take into account the face orientation if the volume turn out to be positive assume the face be orient correctly if it be negative reverse their orientation mark them clockwise if any face be still unknown after thi choose another face and go through the algorithm again at the end face mark clockwise must have their index reverse before facet normal be find note if you be run on silicon graphic machine and buy the iri inventor toolkit developer package you have the source to thi algorithm see if you not sorry i ca give out the source and even if i could it rely heavily on inventor gavin gavin
