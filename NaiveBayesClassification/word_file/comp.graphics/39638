from tgl tom lane subject jpeg image compression frequently asked question archive-name jpeg-faq last-modified may thi faq article discus jpeg image compression suggestion for addition and clarification be welcome new since version of may added info on imageviewer for next thi article include the follow section what be jpeg why use jpeg when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif how well do jpeg compres image what be good quality set for jpeg where can i get jpeg software can software viewer etc source code what all thi hoopla about color quantization how do jpeg work what about lossles jpeg why all the argument about file format how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it what about arithmetic cod do los accumulate with repeat what be some rule of thumb for convert gif image to jpeg section be basic info that every jpeg user need to know section be advance info for the curiou thi article be post every week you can alway find the latest version in the archive at by ftp fetch or if you do have ftp send e-mail to mail-server with body send many other faq article be also store in thi archive for more instruction on use of the archive send e-mail to the same addres with the word help and index no quote on separate line if you do get a reply the server may be misread ymy return addres add a line such a path myname mysite to specify ymy correct e-mail addres to reply to what be jpeg jpeg pronounce jay-peg be a standardize image compression mechanism jpeg stand for joint photographic expert group the original name of the committee that write the standard jpeg be design for compress either full-color or gray-scale digital image of natural real-world scene it do not work so well on non-realistic image such a cartoon or line draw jpeg do not handle black-and-white image nor do it handle motion picture compression standard for compress those type of image be be work on by other committee name jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg be lossy mean that the image you get out of decompression be quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieve much of it compression by exploit know limitation of the human eye notably the fact that small color detail be perceive a well a small detail of light-and-dark thu jpeg be intend for compress image that will be look at by human if you plan to machine-analyze ymy image the small error introduce by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they be invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg be that the degree of lossines can be vary by adjust compression parameter thi mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small file if you do mind poor quality thi be useful for index image archive make thumbnail view or icon etc etc conversely if you be happy with the output quality at the default compression set you can jack up the quality until you be satisfy and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there be two good reason to make ymy image file smaller and to store color datum instead of datum making image file smaller be a big win for transmit file acros network and for archive library of image being able to compres a mbyte full-color file down to kbyte or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you be compare gif and jpeg the size ratio be more like fmy to one more detail below if ymy view software do support jpeg directly you have to convert jpeg to some other format for view or manipulate image even with a jpeg-capable viewer it take longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thu use jpeg be essentially a tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it worth note that when network or phone transmission be involve the time save from transfer a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompres the file i let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif a a standard usenet post format be that jpeg can store full color information million color instead of or le or fewer color if you have only display hardware then thi may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of year though gif will look a obsolete a black-and-white macpaint format do today furthermore for reason detail in section jpeg be far more useful than gif for exchange image among person with widely vary color display hardware hence jpeg be considerably more appropriate than gif for use a a usenet post standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg be not go to displace gif entirely for some type of image gif be superior in image quality file size or both one of the first thing to learn about jpeg be which kind of image to apply it to a a rule of thumb jpeg be superior to gif for store full-color or gray-scale image of realistic scene that mean scan photograph and similar material jpeg be superior even if you do have display hardware and it be a lot superior if you do see section for detail gif do significantly better on image with only a few distinct color such a cartoon and line draw in particular large area of pixel that be all exactly the same color be compress very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg ca squeeze these file a much a gif do without introduce visible defect thi sort of image be best keep in gif form in particular single-color border be quite cheap in gif file but they should be avoid in jpeg file jpeg also ha a hard time with very sharp edge a row of pure-black pixel adjacent to a row of pure-white pixel for example sharp edge tend to come out blur unles you use a very high quality set again thi sort of thing be not find in scan photograph but it show up fairly often in gif file border overlay text etc the blurrines be particularly objectionable with text that only a few pixel high if you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlay text do jpeg it computer-drawn image ray-traced scene for instance usually fall between scan image and cartoon in term of complexity the more complex and subtly render the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same go for semi-realistic artwork fantasy draw and such plain black-and-white two level image should never be convert to jpeg you need at least about gray level before jpeg be useful for gray-scale image it should also be note that gif be lossles for gray-scale image of up to level while jpeg be not if you have an exist library of gif image you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argue that jpeg image quality be superior to gif only apply if both format start from a full-color original if you start from a gif you already irretrievably lose a great deal of information jpeg can only make thing worse however the disk space save may justify convert anyway thi be a decision you have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hint be prepare to leave some image in gif format since some gif will not convert well how well do jpeg compres image pretty darn well here be some sample file size for an image i have handy a full-color image of a ship in a harbor the first three file be for comparison purpose the rest be create with the free jpeg software describe in section file size in byte comment original file in ppm format no compression bite or byte per pixel plu a few byte overhead ppm file pass through unix compres compres do accomplish a lot you note other text-oriented compressor give similar result converted to gif with ppmquant f ppmtogif most of the save be the result of lose color info gif save not see sec cjpeg q highest useful quality set thi be indistinguishable from the original at least to my nonprofessional eyeball cjpeg q default set you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish thi from the original even with both on-screen at once cjpeg q thi ha slight defect if you know what to look for you could tell it be jpeged without see the original still a good image quality a many recent post in usenet picture group cjpeg q jpeg characteristic blockines become apparent at thi set djpeg blocksmooth help some still i see plenty of usenet post that be of poorer image quality than thi cjpeg q optimize optimize cut table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or index purpose note that thi file be tiny the compression ratio from the original be in thi case jpeg can make a file that a factor of fmy or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file be every bite a good a the gif better if you have a full-color display thi seem to be a typical ratio for real-world scene what be good quality set for jpeg most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size v image quality tradeoff by select a quality set there seem to be widespread confusion about the mean of these set quality do not mean keep of the information a some have claim the quality scale be purely arbitrary it not a percentage of anything the name of the game in use jpeg be to pick the lowest quality set smallest file size that decompress into an image indistinguishable from the original thi set will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here be some rule of thumb the default quality set q be very often the best choice thi set be about the lowest you can go without expect to see defect in a typical image try q first if you see defect then go up except for experimental purpose never go above q say q will produce a file two or three time a large a q but of hardly any better quality if the image wa le than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality set to avoid further degradation the second case seem to apply much of the time when convert gif to jpeg the default q be about right for compress image but q to be usually better for convert gif see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or index purpose and be prepare to tolerate large defect a q set in the range of to be about right q or so may be amuse a op art note the quality set discuss in thi article apply to the free jpeg software describe in section and to many program base on it other jpeg implementation such a image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some program do even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choice where can i get jpeg software most of the program describe in thi section be available by ftp if you do know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find source if you do have direct acces to ftp read about ftpmail server in the same article that article appear regularly in or you can get it by send e-mail to mail-server with send in the body the anonymou ftp list faq may also be helpful it in the archive note thi list change constantly if you have a copy more than a couple month old get the latest jpeg faq from the archive if you be look for can software viewer etc the first part of thi list be system-specific program that only run on one kind of system if you do see what you want for ymy machine check out the portable jpeg software describe at the end of the list note that thi list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over internet but some commercial program be list too x window xv shareware be an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image format it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulation it available for ftp from file version be a major upgrade with support for display and many other improvement however it be brand new and still ha some bug lurk if you prefer not to be on the bleed edge stick with version also available from export note that version be not a good choice if you have a display you get only color nor for convert image to jpeg but work fine for convert gif and other image to jpeg caution there be a glitch in version be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when save a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x window be john cristy free imagemagick package also available from file thi package handle many image process and conversion task the imagemagick viewer handle display correctly for colormapped display it do better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above be large complex package if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage support jpeg in it latest release xloadimage be free and available from file xli be a variant version of xloadimage say by it fan to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli be indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg file because it ha the ijg decoder while xloadimage be use a hacked-over the next xloadimage release will fix thi xli be also free and available from file both program be say to do the right thing with display ms-do thi cover plain do for window or program see the next head one good choice be eric praetzel free dvpeg which view jpeg and gif file the current version be available by ftp from file thi be a good basic viewer that work on either or machine the user interface be not flashy but it functional another freeware viewer be mohammad rezaei hiview the current version be available from and mirror site see note below file hiview require a or better cpu and a vcpi-compatible memory manager and work window and do not hiview be currently the fastest viewer for image that be no bigger than ymy screen for larger image it scale the image down to fit on the screen rather than use a most viewer do you may or may not prefer thi approach but there no deny that it slow down load of large image considerably note installation be a bite tricky read the direction carefully a shareware alternative be colorview for do thi be easier to install than either of the two freeware alternative it user interface be also much spiffier-looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystroke inconsistent behavior it be faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for image larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both be faster than hiview the current version be available from and mirror site see note below file require a vesa graphic driver if you do have one look in or from the same directory many recent pc have a built-in vesa driver so do try to load a vesa driver unles colorview complain that the driver be miss a second shareware alternative be fullview which ha be kick around the net for a while but i do know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version be inferior to the above viewer anyway the author tell me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submit to the archive at that time the well-known gif viewer compushow cshow support jpeg in it latest revision however cshow jpeg implementation be very good it slow about half the speed of the above viewer and image quality be poor except on hi-color display too bad it have be nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from and mirror site see note below file due to the remarkable variety of pc graphic hardware any one of these viewer might not work on ymy particular machine if you ca get any of them to work you need to use one of the follow conversion program to convert jpeg to gif then view with ymy favorite gif viewer if you have hi-color hardware do use gif a the intermediate format try to find a targa-capable viewer instead be repute to do the right thing with hi-color display the independent jpeg group free jpeg converter be ftpable from and mirror site see note below file or if you have a and extend memory these file be do compilation of the free source code describe in section they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm format handmade software offer free jpeg gif conversion tool these be slow and be limit to conversion to and from gif format in particular you ca get color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tool be that they will read and write hsi proprietary jpeg format a well a the usenet-standard jfif format since hsi-format file be rather widespread on bbse thi be a useful capability version of these tool be free prior version be shareware get it from and mirror site see note below file note do not use hsi format for file to be post on internet since it be not readable on non-pc platform handmade software also ha a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy thi will translate jpeg file both jfif and hsi format to and from many other image format it can also display image a demo version of image alchemy version be available from and mirror site see note below file note about the internet key archive site for pc-related program be full name run a non-unix system with weird directory name where thi document refer to directory eg at that really mean if you be not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rate from there be several internet site that maintain copy mirror of the archive most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site instead a popular usa mirror site be which keep file in eg if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve file from by e-mail see informational post in to find out how if you be outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where ymy nearest mirror be microsoft window there be several window program capable of display jpeg image window viewer be generally slower than do viewer on the same hardware due to window system overhead note that you can run the do conversion program describe above inside a window do window the newest entry be winecj which be free and extremely fast version be available from file require window and mode thi be a no-frill viewer with the bad habit of hog the machine completely while it decode and the image quality be noticeably worse than other viewer but it so fast you use it anyway at least for preview jview be freeware fairly fast ha good on-line help and can write out the decompress image in window bmp format but it ca create new jpeg file and it do view gif jview also lack some other useful feature of the shareware viewer such a brightnes adjustment but it an excellent basic viewer the current version be available from file mirror of thi archive can be find at some other internet site include winjpeg shareware display jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image file it can write all of these format too so it can be use a a converter it ha some other nifty feature include color-balance adjustment and slideshow the current version be available from and mirror site see note above file thi be a slow version if you register you get the version which be roughly faster colorview be another shareware entry thi wa an early and promise contender but it ha not be update in some time and at thi point it ha no real advantage over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version be available from file i understand that a new version will be appear once the author be finish with colorview for do dvpeg see do head also work under window but only in full-screen mode not in a window the follow file be available from note check for more recent version the hobbe moderator be not very fast about move upload into their permanent directory version of free ijg conversion program version version of same for image archiver image with pm graphical interface strong on conversion function view be a bite weaker shareware pmjpeg port of winjpeg a popular viewer for window see description in window section shareware pmview viewer gif view very fast jpeg view roughly the same speed a the above two program ha image manipulation slideshow function shareware macintosh most mac jpeg program rely on apple jpeg implementation which be part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime instal to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be run system or later if you run system you must also install the quickdraw extension thi be built-in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from file a of thi file contain quicktime which be better than qt in several way with respect to jpeg it be marginally faster and considerably le prone to crash when feed a corrupt jpeg file however some application seem to have compatibility problem with qt mac user should keep in mind that quicktime jpeg format be not the same a the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format see section for detail if you post image on usenet make sure they be in jfif format most of the program mention below can generate either format the first choice be probably jpegview a free program for view image that be in jfif format format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg format the current version be a big improvement over prior version get it from file require system and quicktime on display jpegview usually produce the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewer jpegview can view large image in much le memory than other mac viewer in fact it the only one that can deal with jpeg image much over pixel on a typical mac given a large image jpegview automatically scale it down to fit on the screen rather than present scroll bar like most other viewer you can zoom in on any desire portion though some person like thi behavior some do overall jpegview user interface be very well think out gifconverter a shareware image support jfif and a well a gif and several other image format the latest version be get it from file require system or later gifconverter be not better than jpegview a a plain viewer but it ha much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capability so you may find it worth it shareware fee if you do a lot of play around with image also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif image without quicktime so it be ymy best bet if ymy machine be too old to run quicktime but it faster with quicktime note if gifconverter run out of memory try to load a large jpeg try convert the file to gif with jpeg convert then view the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utility be available from file thi will run on any mac but it only do file conversion not view you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previou version of thi faq recommend imagery jpeg a jpeg gif converter base on an old version of the ijg code if you be use thi program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple free program pictpixie can view image in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these format you can get pictpixie from file require quicktime pictpixie wa intend a a developer tool and it really not the best choice unles you like to fool around with quicktime some of it drawback be that it require lot of memory it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything le than a display and it ha a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie be an unsupported program mean it ha some minor bug that apple do not intend to fix there be an old version of pictpixie call pictcompressor float around the net if you have thi you should trash it a it even buggier also the quicktime starter kit include a much cleaned-up descendant of pictpixie call picture compressor note that picture compressor be not free and may not be distribute on the net storm technology picture decompres be a free jpeg thi rather old program be inferior to the above program in many way but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be force to use it on older system it do need quickdraw so really old machine ca use it you can get it from file you must set the file type of a download image file to to allow picture decompres to open it if ymy machine be too old to run quickdraw a mac plu for instance gifconverter be ymy only choice for single-program jpeg view if you do want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac application be support jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format adobe photoshop version or later can read and write jfif-format jpeg file use the jpeg plug-in from the acquire menu you must set the file type of a download jpeg file to to allow photoshop to recognize it amiga most program list in thi section be store in the aminet archive at there be many mirror site of thi archive and you should try to use the closest one in the usa a good choice be look under hamlab plu be an excellent jpeg a well a be a general image manipulation tool it cheap shareware and can read several format beside jpeg the current version be a demo version be available from and mirror site file the demo version will crop image larger than but it be otherwise fully functional shareware be an image renderer that can display jpeg ilbm and gif image the program can be use to create animation even capture frame on-the-fly from render package like lightwave the current version be available from and mirror site file note although thi directory be supposedly for amigado program the program will also run under amigado or viewtek be a free viewer the current version be available from and mirror site file if you will to spend real money there be several commercial package that support jpeg two be write by thoma krehbiel the author of and viewtek these be cinemorph a standalone image morph package and imagefx an impressive image capture conversion edit paint effect and prepres package that also include cinemorph both be distribute by great valley product art department professional adpro from asdg inc be the most widely use commercial image manipulation software for amiga imagemaster from black belt system be another well-regarded commercial graphic package with jpeg support the free ijg jpeg software be available compile for amiga from and mirror site in directory file these program convert jpeg ppm gif targa format the amiga world be heavily infest with quick-and-dirty jpeg program many base on an ancient beta-test version of the free ijg jpeg software thank to a certain magazine that publish same on it disk-of-the-month without so much a notify the author among these be augjpeg newamyjpeg vjpeg and probably other i have not even hear of in my opinion anything older than ijg version march be not worth the disk space it store on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer atarus st the free ijg jpeg software be available compile for atarus st tt etc from file these program convert jpeg ppm gif targa format for monochrome st monitor try mgif which manage to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flicker version read jpeg file available from file i have not hear of any other free or shareware jpeg-capable viewer for atari but surely there must be some by now pointer appreciate acorn archimede changefsi supply with risc o version can convert from and view jpeg jfif format provision be also make to convert image to jpeg although thi must be do from the cli rather than by double-clicking recent version since of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg along with about other image format while older version can be find on some archimede bboard the current version be only available by register with the author john kortink nutterbrink wj enschede the netherland price dutch guilder about or pound there also a commercial product call jpeg which provide jpeg functionality and direct jpeg view a well a a host of other image format conversion and process option thi be more expensive but not necessarily better than the above program contact dt software freepost cambridge uk tel next imageviewer be a pd utility that display image and can do some format conversion the current version read jpeg but do not write it imageviewer be available from the standard next archive at and somewhere in both be currently be re-organized so it hard to point to specific sub-directory note that there be an older version float around that do not support jpeg portable software for almost any system if none of the above fit ymy situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software describe in you also need a viewer program if ymy display be bite or le any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm image file there be numerou commercial jpeg offer with more pop up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unles you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware-assisted product ask point question about whether the product comply with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial release be not and never will be compatible with anyone else file if you be look for source code to work with free portable c code for jpeg compression be available from the independent jpeg group which i lead a package contain my source code documentation and some small test file be available from several place the official archive site for thi source code be or look under directory the current release be thi be a compress tar file do forget to retrieve in binary mode you can retrieve thi file by ftp or uucp if you be on a pc and do know how to cope with format you may prefer zip format which you can find at and mirror site see note above file thi file will also be available on compuserve in the graphsupport forum go pic library a if you have no ftp acces you can retrieve the source from ymy nearest archive version appear a issue of volume if you do know how to retrieve post see the faq article how to find source refer to at the top of section the free jpeg code provide conversion between jpeg jfif format and image file in gif pbmplu utah rle and truevision targa file format the core compression and decompression module can easily be reuse in other program such a image viewer the package be highly portable we have test it on many machine range from pc to cray we have release thi software for both noncommercial and commercial use company be welcome to use it a the basi for jpeg-related product we do not ask a royalty although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature see the readme file in the distribution for detail we hope to make thi software industrial-quality although a with anything that free we offer no warranty and accept no liability the independent jpeg group be a volunteer organization if you like to contribute to improve my software you be welcome to join what all thi hoopla about color quantization most person do have full-color bite per pixel display hardware typical display hardware store or fewer bite per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct color at a time to display a full-color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative color thi proces be call color quantization thi be something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we stick with the standard usage though clearly color quantization be a lossy proces it turn out that for most image the detail of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduce by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality set since jpeg be a full-color format convert a color jpeg image for display on hardware require color quantization thi be true for all color jpeg even if you fee a gif into jpeg what come out of the decompressor be not color but thousand of color thi happen because jpeg lossines affect each pixel a little differently so two pixel that start with identical color will probably come out with slightly different color each original color get smear into a group of nearby color therefore quantization be alway require to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardles of the image source the only way to avoid quantization be to ask for gray-scale output incidentally because of thi effect it nearly meaningles to talk about the number of color use by a jpeg image even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel value different jpeg decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error difference i occasionally see post image describe a jpeg thi tell me that the poster a ha read thi faq and b probably convert the jpeg from a gif jpeg can be classify a color or gray-scale just like photograph but number of color just be a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition ha already be quantize to or fewer color a gif do have a definite number of color in it palette and the format do allow more than palette entry for purpose of usenet picture distribution gif ha the advantage that the sender precompute the color quantization so recipient do have to thi be also the disadvantage of gif you stick with the sender quantization if the sender quantize to a different number of color than what you can display you have to re-quantize result in much poorer image quality than if you have quantize once from a full-color image furthermore if the sender do use a high-quality color quantization algorithm you out of luck for thi reason jpeg offer the promise of significantly better image quality for all user whose machine do match the sender display hardware jpeg full color image can be quantize to precisely match the user display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm there be a lot of active research in thi area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg image you already have with a gif you stick forevermore with what wa send it also worth mention that many gif-viewing program include rather shoddy quantization routine if you view a gif on a ega display for example you be probably get a much worse image than you need to thi be partly an inevitable consequence of do two color quantization one to create the gif one to display it but often it also due to sloppines jpeg conversion program will be force to use high quality quantizer in order to get acceptable result at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be display thu jpeg be likely to provide better result than the average gif program for low-color-resolution display a well a high-resolution one finally an ever-growing number of person have display hardware already hi-color pc display true display on workstation and macintosh etc for these person gif be already obsolete a it can not represent an image to the full capability of their display jpeg image can drive these display much more effectively thu jpeg be an all-around better choice than gif for represent image in a machine-independent fashion how do jpeg work the buzz-word to know be chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transform coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy cod thi article long enough already so i not go to say more than that here for technical information see the faq thi be available from the archive at in file if you need help in use the archive see the top of thi article what about lossles jpeg there a great deal of confusion on thi subject the jpeg committee do define a truly lossles compression algorithm one that guarantee the final output be bit-for-bit identical to the original input however thi lossles mode ha almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offer much le compression at present very few implementation of lossles jpeg exist and all of them be commercial saying q to the free jpeg software do not get you a lossles image what it do get rid of be deliberate information los in the coefficient quantization step there be still a good deal of information los in the color subsampling step with the free jpeg code you can also say sample to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementation can not cope with the result file even with both quantization and subsampling turn off the regular jpeg algorithm be not lossles because it be subject to roundoff error in variou calculation the maximum error be a few count in any one pixel value it highly unlikely that thi could be perceive by the human eye but it might be a concern if you be do machine process of an image at thi minimum-los set regular jpeg produce file that be perhap half the size of an uncompress image true lossles jpeg provide roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantee bit-for-bit accuracy if you have an application require lossles storage of image with le than bite per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard thi perform better than jpeg lossles on such image jpeg lossles be superior to jbig on image with or more bite per pixel furthermore jpeg be public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig technique be heavily cover by patent why all the argument about file format strictly speak jpeg refer only to a family of compression algorithm it do not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee wa prevent from define a file format by turf war within the international standard organization since we ca actually exchange image with anyone else unles we agree on a common file format thi leaf u with a problem in the absence of official standard a number of jpeg program writer have just go off to do their own thing and a a result their program be compatible with anybody else the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format be some work that be coordinate by person at c-cube microsystem they have define two jpeg-based file format jfif jpeg file interchange format a low-end format that transport pixel and not much else aka tiff an extension of the aldu tiff format tiff be a high-end format that will let you record just about everything you ever want to know about an image and a lot more beside tiff be a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove le transportable because different vendor have historically implement slightly different and incompatible subset of tiff it not likely that add jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve thi situation both of these format be develop with input from all the major vendor of jpeg-related product it reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both standard i believe that usenet should adopt jfif a the replacement for gif in picture post jfif be simpler than tiff and be available now the tiff spec ha only recently be officially adopt and it be still unusably vague on some crucial detail even when be well define the jfif format be likely to be a widely support lowest common denominator file may never be a transportable a particular case that person may be interest in be apple quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime use a jfif-compatible format wrap inside the mac-specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg be pretty straightforward and several mac program be available to do it see mac portion of section if you have an editor that handle binary file you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for detail another particular case be handmade software program and image alchemy these program be capable of read and write jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format develop by hsi thi format be not readable by any non-hsi program and should not be use for usenet post use the j switch to get jfif output thi apply to old version of these program the current release emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi-format file unles you want to get flame by person on non-pc platform how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an allege jpeg file that ymy software wo read it likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file a jfif-standard file will start with the character hex ff ff follow by two variable byte often hex follow by if you see ff at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file thi be probably decodable as-i by jfif software it worth a try anyway hsi file start with you out of luck unles you have hsi software portion of the file may look like plain jpeg datum but they wo decompres properly with non-hsi program a macintosh pict file if jpeg-compressed will have a couple hundred byte of header follow by a jfif header scan for strip off everything before the ff and you should be able to read it anything else it a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you be lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg datum stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg datum stream look for ff try strip off everything before that in uuencoded usenet post the characteristic jfif pattern be begin line m wherea uuencoded hsi file will start with begin line m if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of download non-jfif file what about arithmetic cod the jpeg spec define two different back end module for the final output of compress datum either huffman cod or arithmetic cod be allow the choice ha no impact on image quality but arithmetic cod usually produce a smaller compress file on typical image arithmetic cod produce a file or percent smaller than huffman cod all the file-size number previously cite be for huffman cod unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic cod specify by the jpeg standard be subject to patent own by ibm at t and mitsubishi thu you can not legally use arithmetic cod unles you obtain license from these company the fair use doctrine allow person to implement and test the algorithm but actually store any image with it be dubiou at best at least in the short run i recommend that person not worry about arithmetic cod the space save be great enough to justify the potential legal hassle in particular arithmetic cod should not be use for any image to be exchange on usenet there be some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tune for further detail do los accumulate with repeat it would be nice if have compress an image with jpeg you could decompres it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompres it without any further image degradation beyond what you lose initially unfortunately thi is not the case in general recompressing an alter image losis more information though usually not a much a wa lose the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompres an image and recompres it without change it then there be no further los you get an identical jpeg file even thi be not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compres and decompres the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the first-generation output it usually take many such cycle to get visible change one of the thing on my to-do list be to see if accumulation of error can be avoid or limit but i be not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guarantee would be that compress the unmodified full-color output of djpeg at the original quality set would introduce no further los even such simple change a crop off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation if you wonder why it because the pixel-block boundary move if you crop off only multiple of pixel you might be safe but that a mighty limit capability the bottom line be that jpeg be a useful format for archival storage and transmission of image but you do want to use it a an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation step use a lossles format ppm rle tiff etc while work on the image then jpeg it when you be ready to file it away aside from avoid degradation you will save a lot of time thi way what be some rule of thumb for convert gif image to jpeg a state earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an exist gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full-color datum the gif wa make from it far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here be some suggestion for get maximum space save with minimum los of quality the first rule when convert a gif library be to look at each jpeg to make sure you be happy with it before throw away the correspond gif that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality set if necessary some gif may be better leave a gif a explain in section in particular cartoon-type gif with sixteen or fewer color do convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the size too experience to date suggest that large high-visual-quality gif be the best candidate for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential save and they convert to jpeg with least degradation do waste ymy time convert any gif much under kbyte also do expect jpeg file convert from gif to be a small a those create directly from full-color original to maintain image quality you may have to let the convert file be a much a twice a big a straight-through jpeg file would be shoot for or the size of the gif file not a suggest in earlier comparison many person have develop an odd habit of put a large constant-color border around a gif image while useles thi wa nearly free in term of storage cost in gif file it be not free in jpeg file and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact ghost edge do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you be on an x window system xv manual and automatic crop function be a very painles way to do thi cjpeg default q set of be appropriate for full-color input but for gif input q set of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smooth a suggest below the higher q set may not be necessary color gif of photograph or complex artwork be usually dither to fool ymy eye into see more than the color that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixel be often of significantly different color at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dither be that to jpeg it look like high-spatial-frequency color noise and jpeg ca compres noise very well the result jpeg file be both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have get from jpeging the original full color image if you have it to get around thi you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing average together nearby pixel thu approximate the color that you think you saw anyway and in the proces get rid of the rapid color change that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smooth will often let you avoid use a high q factor thu further reduce the size of the compress file while still obtain a better-looking output image than you get without smooth with the free jpeg software or product base on it a simple smooth capability be build in try smooth or so when convert gif value of to seem to work well for high-quality gif heavy-handed dither may require larger smooth factor if you can see regular fine-scale pattern on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smooth be definitely call for too large a smooth factor will blur the output image which you do want if you be an image process wizard you can also do smooth with a separate filter program such a pnmconvol from the pbmplu package however cjpeg built-in smoother be a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all thi be that cjpeg quality smooth be probably a good start point for convert gif but if you really care about the image you want to check the result and maybe
