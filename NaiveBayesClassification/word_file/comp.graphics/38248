from jonas-y jona yngvesson subject re point within a polygon scrowe simon crowe write i be look for an algorithm to determine if a give point be bind by a polygon do anyone have any such code or a reference to book contain information on the subject well it be a while since thi wa discuss so i take the liberty of reprint without permission so sue me eric haine reprint of the very interest discussion of thi topic jona o o x snip snip x o o give a man a fish and he eat one day give a man a fish rod and he laze around fish and never do anything with that in mind i reprint without permission so sue me relevant information post some year ago on thi very problem note the early use of postscript technology predate many of thi year paper list in the april siggraph program announcement post here a few day ago eric intersection between a line and a polygon undecidable by dave baraff tom duff from deb newsgroup keyword p np jordan curve separation ursyhon metrization theorem organization program of computer graphic in article ncsmith timothy lyle smith write i need to find a to determine if a line intersect a polygon i would prefer a method that would do thi in a little time a possible i need thi for use in a forward raytracing program i think that thi be a very difficult problem to start with line and polygon be semi-algebraic set which both contain uncountable number of point here be a few off-the-cuff idea first we need to check if the line and the polygon be separate now the jordan curve separation theorem say that the polygon divide the plane into exactly two open and thu non-compact region thu the line ly completely inside the polygon the line ly completely outside the polygon or possibly but thi will rarely happen the line intersect the polyon now the phrase of thi question say if a line intersect a polygon so thi be a decision problem one possibility the decision model approach be to reduce the question to some other well know problem q and then try to solve q an answer to q gife an answer to the original decision problem in recent year many geometric problem have be successfully model in a new language call postscript see postscript language by adobe system incorporated isbn co so give a line l and a polygon p we can write a postscript program that draw the line l and the polygon p and then output the answer by output we mean the program execute a command call showpage which actually print a page of paper contain the line and the polygon a quick examination of the paper provide an answer to the reduce problem q and thu the original problem there be two small problem with thi approach there be an infinite number of way to encode l and p into the reduce problem q so we will be force to invoke the axiom of choice or equivalently zorn lemma but the use of the axiom of choice be not regard in a very seriou light these day more importantly the question arise a to whether or not the postscript program q will actually output a piece of paper or in other word will it halt now postscript be expressive enough to encode everything that a turing machine might do thu the halt problem for postscript be undecidable it be quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable i wo even begin to go into other difficulty such a aliasing finite precision and run out of ink paper or both a couple of reference might be principium mathematica newton i cambridge university pres cambridge england sorry i do have an isbn for thi an introduction to automatum theory language and computation hopcroft j and ulman j the c programming language kernighan b and ritchie d a tale of two city dicken c from td tom duff summary overkill organization at t bell laboratory murray hill nj the situation be not nearly a bleak a baraff suggest he should know better he hang around the lab for long enough by the well know dobbin-dullman reduction see j dullman d dobbin j comp obfusc ius pp lemma a line-polygon intersection can be reduce to hamiltonian circuit without the use of grobner basis so lpus to coin an acronym be probably only np-complete beside turing-completenes will no longer be a problem once my be deliver since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in millisecond with scatter-gather from deb david baraff well sure it no worse than np-complete but that only if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfy a lipschitz condition on it second derivative i think there an siggraph paper from caltech that deal with thi j o n a s y n g v e s s o n email jonas-y dept of electrical engineering voice university of linkoping sweden fax
