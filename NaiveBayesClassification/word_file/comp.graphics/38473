from andrew paul dicken subject re computer graphic to vcr getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape be harder than it look the standard vga and ega output be very different than the ntsc format use by television while there be equipment that will do the conversion it be hard to get ymy hand on and cost quite a bite if you have acces to an amiga computer that ha an ntsc output you can transfer certain type of graphic file by modem and tape them from the ntsc output unfortunately thi would be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unles you have a good amiga animation program otherwise see if ymy local public acces cable station ha equipment that you can use
