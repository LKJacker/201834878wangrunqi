from mor ralph mor subject re tom gaskin pexlib v phig programming manual merlin merlin write could someone explain the difference between tom gaskin two book o pexlib programming manual o phig programming manual why would i want to buy one book v the other book i have an run sco unix on my desktop a sun in my lab and acces to a variety of other system alliant cray on the network mostly we would like to do of rat rabbit monkey and human brain structure rather than decide which book you want to buy you need to decide which program interface you want to use then buy the appropriate book i write an article for the x resource which discus the difference between phig and pexlib it will appear in issue which should be out pretty soon but here a brief summary phig be a graphic apus which wa design to be portable to many device most implementation support the x window system and take advantage of a extension to x call pex pexlib be a slightly lower level apus which wa design to efficiently support the pex extension to x some advantage of use pexlib integrate with xlib xt motif etc better than phig provide immediate mode capability is free of policy pex support phig but be currently be extend to support feature not find in phig like texture map anti-aliasing pexlib will give you acces to all of these feature some advantage of use phig support for multiple device not just x base one support for archive metafile hardcopy output phig ha predefined input device to make input easier phig can handle exposure event and resize for you phig can help you with colormap if you work strictly in x and do care about thing like archive i would go with pexlib either way you will find that both apus have a lot in common ralph mor mit x consortium
