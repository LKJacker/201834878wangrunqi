from steve hcrlgw steven collin subject sphere from point another method be to first find the center of the circle define by set of point and intersect the normal from there thi would also define the circle center however small numerical imprecision would make the line not intersect supposedly plane have to intersect in a unique point if they be not parallel having think about thi why do you project the line onto the plane form by the line do an intersection calculation in the plane in where you guarantee a unique solution unles they parallel which wo happen in thi case and then use parametric distance along the line from the circle centre to determine the exact point of interest thi bypass the messy error propogation require to do the calculation in hope i have put my foot in it again steve steven collin email steve visiting computer graphic researcher phone hitachi central research lab tokyo fax
