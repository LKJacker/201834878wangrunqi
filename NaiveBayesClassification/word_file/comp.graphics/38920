from iharkest inge harkestad subject tangent vector of kochanek-bartel spline i work on a system which use a give set of key frame position x y z to control an imaginary camera movement i use kochanek-bartel spline a describe in the siggraph proceed to create a variable number of inbetween between the key frame i want the inbetween to be give in the form x y z dx dy dz where the last three argumentsa be the x y and z component of the view direction vector of the camera when position at x y z the method present by kochanek and bartel only deal with the position of the inbetween view point to be generate i try to set the view direction at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjacent view point which in general be not key frame but thi cause a sligt discontinuity of the view direction vector at the key frame position although the spatial movement seem to work fine and i quite certain i think that i not simply make an implementation error now i wonder if anyone out there ha use thi spline form for similar purpose and how they decide the view vector i appreciate reply to be email to me at iharkest anyone else interest in the answer will be send a summary of the reply if they contact me n g e a r k e s t a d iharkest comp sc nth norwegian institute of technology some person play hard to get i play hard to want ford fairlane
