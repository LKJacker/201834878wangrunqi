from lilley chri lilley subject oh make up ymy mind wa re xv problem in article rhj kouhium juhana write in article write in article avt kouhium juhana write i write something about make color modification quickly with quantize image and only at the save the image to file proces we have to make the modification to the image thi make sense because the main use of xv be only view image doing many change to image we should keep all modification in a buffer and then before make the operation to image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operation think about what you be say here the bite image be quantise down to bite so many colour be map onto a single palette colmy thi colmy get modify in fairly arbitrary way you then want to apply these modification back to the bite file so you have to find which colour map to thi one palette colmy i suppose you do know what about we have discuss we discuss about error s in xv which show image only a and my suggestion above work perfectly with it look be consistent first you post something that seem to suggest that you see xv be an bite program a some sort of error so i post and asy it be not a bug it be mean to be like that so you post and say it be not a bug you never say it wa i have misunderstand etc now you be say we discuss about error s in xv which show image only a if you would make up ymy mind what you be claim it would make the discussion a lot easier so far i have see a colormap edit window in xv that be there must be a colormap anyway the problem you present be exist anyway and i do try to solve them at all because i would not make such problem to my program in the first place eh sorry i do understand what you be say here i be aware that english be not ymy native language and have try hard to fathom ymy mean but thi paragraph defeat me gamma and color correction be easily do to image a i present there no need make trick from image back to bite image ye a i originally say global change be easily possible but thi statement contradict what you say earlier i write something about make color modification quickly with quantize image and only at the save the image to file proces we have to make the modification to the image how would you suggest do colmy edit on a bite file how would you group colour to edit them together only global change could be do unles the software be very different and much more complicate ok you write about situation that user want edit image a and user want edit individual color ymy question by the way jump off the discussion a bite no i do think so actually you be talk about load a bite image into xv by quantise manipulate the colour in the colmy editor then somewhow apply these change to the bite file when you exit xv xv let you edit individual colour where be thi sudden jump off the topic my solution do work because there no colormap withing real image ye i be aware there be no colourmap in a bite file you see user see image go back to be silly i do not understand what thi statement be suppose to mean about change individual color in image change individual color in colormap be useles in most case if the image be quantize and rasterize small change may make seriou error to anywhere in the image what be you say xv allow thi feature but i do recommend to use it with the mention type image ah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow edit of bite preview of bite image then i point out problem with thi now you be say there be no problem because you personally happen not to use those part of the program that cause the problem moreover xv be not a paint program you can only make those global change not sure what you be say here certainly one can make local change in full xv change individual color sound like paint program job if person have screen there need for trick to get the original image modify because user do see full image there need to make approximation and it be not possible to modify individual color but individual pixel or pixel group if image be rasterize to select indiavidual color there could be cursor window which show true color image in cursor window area select individual color be possible from that ye that be one possible approach i would find a program that take such an approach clumsy however ok i do have think very much paint program never see such in good view and be not plan to make such not to mention paint program in screen well here we agree you have not think it through very much you do seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off day perhap you should step back and think thi one through ye again what be wa wrong with xv it save image a jpeg jpeg be not design for that a i say in the last post jpeg be a compression algorithm it be a way of save disk space by trade off quality against compression i fail to see what the problem be you have not propose any workable alternative also human expect that will be save a image speak for yourself you be the only person i have meet or speak to who have quantise a bite image down to bite expect thi proces to somehow reverse when the file be save keep all modificvation that heve be make to the bite image palette perhap that be why you yused the singular say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it be expect that the image still be the same look next time you import a bite image into xv look carefully at the main control panel it tell you how many colour have be allocate to the bite image xv make it abundantly clear that you be not edit the original bite file you be the only person who claim thi be confuse so xv be design without think about human interface and how human expect the program work design error is a design error the same a a bug read my lip xv be a program for view and modify bite image it let you import other image it show i would say a good deal of think about the human interface and everyone else seem to use it happily for the purpose it wa design for it make no false claim i have hear xv be design first for but it be not good idea to take full image without make major change to the original design if you would come up with a solid logical well argue and lucid description of precisely how these propose extension would work feel free to post them so far you have not do so so even all screen image be the process image and save image could have be very easily instead of argh after all thi a comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it be so easy or alternatively look up the term import and transformation before anybody will make a note ye i may a well make a lift where mean that the lift go down and mean that the lift go up and put a note on thi design solution to the manual however even the manual tell the correct situation it do solve the problem american the lift be just an example i think thi be a bite of an exageration what you be actually say be you get into a lift elevator if you be in the state and mistakenly press the down button to go up everyone else have no problem now you be try to sue the manufacturer well my text may be a bite hard read you bet hopefully you suggeeded to read it mostly leaving aside the language issue however it betray some very wooly think a you yourself admit which be the same in any language go think some more chri
