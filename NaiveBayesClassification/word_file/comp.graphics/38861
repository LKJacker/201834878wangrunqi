from liones subject kubotum spec okay i get enough reply about the kubotum system that i will post a summary of their capability i have actually use one or see one so take the spec with a grain of salt i like to see an independent review of one against say an sgi indigo extreme or something basically the kenai workstation be dec alpha axp base workstation that run dec and will likely run window nt in the future they be binary compatible with digital alpha axp implementation denali be their graphic subsystem which be upgradable in the field by simply add transformation engine the two main kenai machine be the imaging and graphic workstation and the imaging and graphic workstation cpu dec alpha axp dec alpha axp on-chip cache onboard cache word size memory initial memory future graphic transform module frame buffer module frame buffer double buffer double buffer z-buffer stereo support ye ye other both machine will double buffer or do stereo output per window both have an auxiliary video output that be ntsc and pal storage internal-fixed internal-removable max capacity gb io both have turbochannel ethernet and fddi application programming interface both have library for xlib motif mit pexlib dec-pexlib dec-phig and gl okay now the real stuff the kenai station work with a graphic architecture know a denali the denali come in three model the e p and v they use a decchip superscalar risc processor at their capability be a follow e p v vector vector vector vector triangle triangle pixel flat shade connect pixel gouraud shade connect pixel wide anti-aliased connect gouraud shade z-buffered strip texture map persp point sample image processing cine loop cine loop cine loop contrast stretch bilinear zoom trilinear interp lookup table to trilinear interpolation voxel configuration frame buffer module transform engine mod a you can see these be pretty powerful workstation and the best part be the price i would recommend that you call kubotum for more information their number be i sure they send you an information you may want oh some price low-end kenai e series w tem and fbm dollar kenai e series w tem and fbm dollar high-end kenai v series w tem and fbm dollar kenai v series w tem and fbm dollar if someone could post a relative comparision with an indigo extreme or something i would appreciate it hope thi help someone out there brian ps i be not affiliate with kubotum in any way hell i think they make tractor or something
