from loui loui gonzalez subject sphinx satellite image processing under sphinx sphinx be a user-friendly state-of-the-art image process and analysi package that run acros a spectrum of high performance computer platform operate unix and the x-window system it wa create to meet to the daily research need of scientist conduct climate investigation use satellite datum and remote sense technique intuitive graphic interface sphinx feature an interactive interface with pop-up menu and point-and-click dialog box which make image process and analysi simple and fast thi accessible menuing enable you to build attractive image layout quickly while also provide you the flexibility of return to the main menu to conduct other image analysi and process operation image format compatibility using smart function sphinx allow you to easily open and save image file in a variety of format use bite integer or real datum value sphinx also read and write the common tiff and gif format a well a compress and decompress image format to save disk space image analysi processing for image and pixel analysi the sphinx package include an assortment of process tool that perform useful statistical and mathematical filter operation such a fourier transform convolution product or principal component analysis an interactive interpreter for both algebraic equation and image allow the user to manipulate and combine individual datum channel interactively standard fortran notation be use for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental function satellite spectra orbit analysi sphinx posse function to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for variou meteorological satellite go meteosat noaa spot etc the simulation be conduct for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface condition and instrument spectral band a geometry model compute the solar zenith angle warp orbit simulation and image projection easy external program interfacing sphinx allow user the flexibility to integrate externally develop software algorithm for process and convert satellite observation sphinx export and import image file and image parameter to external program use special interface function quick quality presentation sphinx rapidly display manipulate and enhance high-resolution multispectral image and color table using six image plane and one graphic plane the package conveniently combine color image graphic and text to generate sharp digital image for article and report sphinx and graphic editor provide complete flexibility for modify and integrate vector graphic and analysi plot with image such a histogram and radial graph the package supply color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printer other capability sphinx also perform image animation external graphic import mosaic fit what else software support development sphinx wa develop at the laboratoire atmospherique loa of the universite de lille france the package ha receive critical feedback and support from scientist at the french national laboratory centre national de recherche scientifique cnr and the french space agency centre national spatiale cne at loa sphinx undergo continue refinement and development to meet change research need and advance in computer technology the package which feature on-line help be support by an internet addres sphinx through which question can be answer and version update provide without delay performance tested cne ha select sphinx to analyze and proces the satellite datum collect during the upcoming satellite mission today the sphinx package be in use at the nasa goddard space flight center and be widely use in many french laboratory include the centre de recherche en physique de ecole normale superieure laboratoire d etude et de recherch en teledetection spatiale laboratoire de meteorologie dynamique a test version of sphinx is available at anonymou bin cd sphinx get in the test version the output file are disable however the visualisation and graphic function are available thi is sufficient to work with if you are interested in keeping sphinx send u ymy email and you will receive news about the package evolution the software is changing with user suggestion we will appreciate ymy comment
