from club koltovoy nikolay alexeevich subject news re list or image process system moscow scientific inductrial association spectrum offer videoscan vision system for wich include software and set of controller software for support videoscan family program kit wa develop kit include more then different function for image process kit work in the interactive regime and ha include help for non professional user there be next possibility input frame by any board of videoscan family read white image to from disk print image on the printer make arithmetic with frame filter image work with gistogramme edit image include user exe module controller the function of controller be to load tv-image into controller allow one to load a fragment of the tv-frame from a field of pixel the clock rate be mhz when load an image with pixel in the line and mhz when load a pixel image thi provide the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal and vertical direction the number of gray level in any input mode be video signal capture time controller the purpose of the controller be to enter the tv image into a ibm pc at or any other machine of that type the controller wa create on the base of modern element include user programmable gate array the controller allow to digitize a input signal with different resolution it flexible architecture make possible to change technical parameter instead of tv signal one can proces any other analog signal include signal from slow-speed scan device the controller ha the follow technical characteristic memory volume from k to mb resolution when work with standard video signal from to pixel resolution when work in slow input regime up to pixel video signal capture time m maximum size of a screen when memory volume be pixel number of gray level clock rate for input up to mhz input video multiplexer lookup table lut possibility to realize scroll and zoom line for external synchronization an input use external control signal electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog digital converter possibility output image to the color rgb monitor one can change all list above function and parameter of the controller by reprogramming it image processor image processor allow to digitize and proces tv signal in real time it be possible digitize tv signal with resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation with two image processor wa create on the base of modern element include user programmable gate array and design a a board for pc memory volume allow write to the frame with format it be possible to accumulate until image the processor ha the follow technical characteristic memory volume to mb number of the gray level input video multiplexer lookup table electronic adjustment for black and white adc reference image size from to possibility color and black white output possibility input from slow-scan video source
