from lilley chri lilley subject re xv problem in article avt kouhium juhana write in article write move on a bite i write something about make color modification quickly with quantize image and only at the save the image to file proces we have to make the modification to the image thi make sense because the main use of xv be only view image doing many change to image we should keep all modification in a buffer and then before make the operation to image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operation think about what you be say here the bite image be quantise down to bite so many colour be map onto a single palette colmy thi colmy get modify in fairly arbitrary way you then want to apply these modification back to the bite file so you have to find which colour map to thi one palette colmy ok you could do thi by copy the bite file to a bite file and use the extra bite to hold the index entry having do thi you need to do something to them what exactly apply the difference in rgb between the original and modify palette entry to each colmy in the group thi could generate colour with rgb outside the range it would also lead to discontinuity when different part of a smooth colmy gradient map to several different palette entry you could interpolate from full modification to no modification depend how far each colmy wa from the palette entry however i suspect thi would look rather odd so in summary what i say in my previou post still hold how would you suggest do colmy edit on a bite file how would you group colour to edit them together only global change could be do unles the software be very different and much more complicate if you want to do colmy edit on a bite image you need much more powerfull software which be readily available commercially in other word to edit a bite file you need software build for the job tacking mod onto xv be go to create more problem than it solf a to the other bite you seem to be claim that there be bug in xv if that wa not what you mean then you propably misunderstand what i write a you have do in many place so far ye i probably do i find that the collect digest format of ymy post make it a little difficult to understand precisely what ymy point wa sorry if i misunderstand you also miss what be be wrong with xv however i do write it ye again what be wa wrong with xv chri lilley technical author ittus computer graphic and visualisation training project computer graphic unit manchester computing centre oxford road manchester uk internet voice fax janet
