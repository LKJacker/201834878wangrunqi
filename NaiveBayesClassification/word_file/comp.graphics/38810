from asecchium adrian secchium subject raytracing colour i have a question about recursive backward raytracing when an incident ray i strike an object at point p first the normal n be calculate light ray be calculate to ln where n be the number of light source these be the light ray that do not intersect with anything the reflect ray r and the transmit ray t be calculate from the formula calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colour along the ray r and t a rcol and tcol each object ha it own colmy ocol and each light source ha licol i n the question be how do you combine rcol tcol ocol and all the licol to get the correct result colmy to return along the i ray all colour be define a strucure record have r g b component between and if anyone ha do thi before could you give me a few hint adrian secchium asecchium
