from olson dave olson subject re sgi sale practice wa crimson wa kubotum announcement in qem spl steve lamont write what i be annoy about be the fact that we be lead to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck it should have be make fairly clear that the most crimson would ever get wa a old style mhz cpu upgrade certainly thi wa mention on on more than one occasion a be likely if my sale folk be say otherwise they be either confuse or le than or somebody further up the chain inside sgi wa mislead them i also annoy about be sell several personal irise at a previou site on the understand that architecture would be around for a while rather than be flush there be version although admittedly the come out at the same time a the over a period of year the chassis simply could be push any further i say year wa a pretty good lifespan myself for a system design in thi day and age getting the to work cause a lot of gray hair in both the hardware and product design group we would have be out of my mind to push it further and i know that wa make clear almost from the day the start ship we have one last kicker in the form of the elan graphic which make graphic version over it lifespan which i also think be pretty good now i understand that sgi be responsible to it investor and ha to keep show a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i find myself pressure on at least two occasion to get the busines on the book just before the end of the quarter but i just a little tire of get bone in the proces please by all mean send a complaint letter through sgi support or sale on ymy concern there should be no reason for sale folk to misrepresent future upgrade to customer sure sometime there will be confusion for a while over whether an upgrade will be available but that should last too long and do seem to be what you be refer to ye the sale folk do get bonu at the end of some all quarter but that be pretty common industry wide and sometime that can result in good deal for customer sometime it probably push folk into system that be what they need i sure but nobody be force you to buy at end of quarter after all maybe it because my lab buy sgi in onesy and twosy so we be entitle to a peek under the cover a the big kid nasa for instance be thi lab and i suspect that a lot of other lab they do get all that long a lead time either although certainly they get presentation on possible new product and their opinion may well influence the end product but that also be life in the industry we ca design system that meet just their need or we wo sell too many system after all which be not to say that we do have some niche product like reality engine and organization do have a load of money to spend on computer every year so we ca be out buy new system on a regular basi the box that we buy now will have to last u pretty much through the entire grant period of five year and in some case beyond that mean that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that wa build to paraphrase one previou poster word fill a niche to compete with some other vendor i go to be look at thi box for the next five year and every time i look at it i go to think about sgi and how i could have better spend my money actually ymy money since we support almost entirely by federal tax dollar but surely you do expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period that a rather unreasonable expectation in my experience with supported and part available ye but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest now you have to pardon me while i go off and his and fume in a corner somewhere and think dark libelou think i miss ymy first post but a i say by all mean share ymy frustation with somebody at a level inside sgi where it might have an effect not immediate i sure but complaint be go to be ignore and may affect future plan if we hear similar thing from more than one all of the above be a usual my personal opinion not sgi let no one tell me that silence gife consent dave olson because whoever be silent dissent silicon graphic inc marium isabel barreno olson ps i start my sabbatical may ask those question now
