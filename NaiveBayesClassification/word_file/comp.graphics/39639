from broehl bernie roehl subject re optimizing projection in article liones write my three-d library do a lot of projection duh but currently it be project an object vertex on a per triangle basi thi be grossly inefficient for of the object display which can be optimize by do projection one time once for each vertex but object whose z-extent intersect the hither plane ca benefit from thi because new vertex must be create during z-clipping anyone have any better idea ye here what you should do keep the vertex in an array and have the polygon triangle be okay but n-sided polygon be slightly more efficient store the index into the array of the vertex that comprise them you set a flag for each vertex when you transform it so you do have to transform any vertex more than once you also do backface elimination before process the polygon so that vertex that belong only to bacfacing poly do have to be transform at all whenever you transform a vertex check if it on the far side of the hither plane if it be you can project it right away and store the result then do ymy z clip any vertex that get produce will have to have their projection do at that stage bernie roehl university of waterloo dept of electrical and computer engineering mail broehl voice x work
