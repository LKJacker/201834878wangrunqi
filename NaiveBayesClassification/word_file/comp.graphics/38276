from katkere arun katkere subject re cylinder and ray in article koehler write i would be most thrill if some kind person could help me with the follow given a cylinder in define a a line segment between two point and a radiu sx sy sz to ex ey ez and r what be the easiest and not too expensive way to find if a ray define a another line through two point cut through thi cylinder and if so where i think the test for touch be rather simple if the closest approach of the two line be le than r then the ray do penetrate the cylinder nope thi wo work for a cylinder you can have a line arbitrarily close to the the cylinder backbone and yet not intersect it the test work for a pillbox though a cylinder with two hemisphere attach at the end thank ryan koehler arun
