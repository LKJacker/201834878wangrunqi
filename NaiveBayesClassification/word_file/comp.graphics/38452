from sean mcmain mcmain subject re rumour about first off thank to all who have fill me in on the existence of the i assume rashly that the particular number would be reserve for further enhancement to the motorola line rather than meted out to another company ah well i gues that what i get when i assume the computer industry will operate in a logical manner in article ricardo hernandez muchado ricardo write sean i do want to get into a by what i be go to say but i have to be a little bite skeptic about the performance you be claim on the centri you see why please no-flame i reserve those for i wa in chicago in the last consumer electronic show and apple have a booth there i walk by and they be show real-time video capture use a radiou or supermac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movie i think the quicktime they be use wa the old one version of quicktime be a ha be state the current version of the software the older version be and be on the horizon in the not too distant future they digitize a guy talk there in something it play back quite nicely and in real time the guy then expand the window resize to by in y i think and the frame rate decrease enough to notice that it wa or about anymore it drop to like fp then he increase it just a bite more and it drop to fp quicktime do a much better job of play back movie at size than it do play back resize movie apparently the proces of expand each frame image and dither the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bite depth be pretty processor-intensive there be optimizer that work pretty well for show movie at double size but if you drop to size or increase to size performance suffer dramatically then i ask him what mac he wa use he wa use a quadra do know what model to do it and he wa tell the guy there that the quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an lcius he lie quicktime be very cpu dependent he wa probably confuse by the fact that qt be lock to an internal timecode and will play in the same amount of time on any machine however an lc will drop frame in order to keep the sound and video sync up the centri and quadra have similar cpu and will thu boast similar performance though the quadra will be a bite faster due to marginally faster clock speed and somewhat different architecture well i spoil hi claim so to say since a quadra mac wa have a little bite of trouble and thi wa even from the hardisk thi wa from memory could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assist centri or another software product run the animation like supposedly macromind accelerator i expect that the version of the quicktime software you saw wa i wa use wa one of the new codec in allow video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate a what version could handle the centri i saw wa a plain-vanilla with the exception of the nice speaker that be play the sound and the software wa movie player the qt player apple include with the software do misunderstand me i just want to clarify thi no problem it still surprise me that quicktime be able to do the thing it do a well a it can sean mcmain check out the gopher university of north texa new band info server fax box at e-mail denton tx mcmain
