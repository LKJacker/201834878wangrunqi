from blf barry frishberg subject re best radar detector from article by troy troy wecker earlier i comment on the and jimf reply about the value of the unit bogey counter i do really go into why i call thi feature a gimmick so here be more explanation thank jim for the good comment and opinion from what i understand the can only tell if these microwave be come from the front rear or both there be only two antenna if they be come from both thi in interpret a a side bogey bogey count be determine a source by their relative strength to one another even if they be reflection of the same source it sound like ymy analysi be base on hypothesi and not actually use the i like to give some feedback base on real life experince i keep the in advance logic mode and it rarely light up a a christma tree the only time it do be when i be in the middle of a major shop area and then it make sense that be do since there be source come from many different direction i have find the to be consistent in it report of bogey regardles of any move car in the area i have find the directional indication to be very useful in one case there wa two radar trap set up within one mile of each other a i pass the first radar trap the direction indication change then the detector wa set off again point in the forward direction with other radar detector i would have assume that thi wa due to a reflection but with the i know there wa a high probability that there wa another trap and there wa on other occasion the directional help discern a false alarm from a true alarm for example a i pa a source the direction indicator change the directional also allow me to focu my attention a to where the signal might be come from instead of have to look all over the place when a car be approach me from the rear with a detector that leak i can tell that the signal be come from the rear and a the car pas me i can verify the source with other detector i would have be unable to do thi and would have have to assume that there wa a radar trap when there wa none i have the for several month now and find it add feature to be useful and not gimmick barry barry frishberg blf chelmsford-uk expert center chelmsford ma
