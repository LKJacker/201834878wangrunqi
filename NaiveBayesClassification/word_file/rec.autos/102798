from robert william fusi subject re most bang for in article r obert william fusi write in article d a vid bond write in cpkjp kevin parker write i like to get some feedback on a car with most bang for the buck in the to price range i look for a car with enough civility to b e drive every day or even on long trip but when i hit the ga i want to fe e l take a look at a tauru sho they can be find for and be the ultimate in door sport car performance similar to a mustang but quite civil and comfortable try to get a late model for the better shifter the cutting edge bb a pcboard system houston texa usa run uupcb well you could alway go with a mustang lx with a pleasant but the diamond star car put out hp in the turbo model and hp in the awd turbo model these car also have handle to match the muscle and be civil in regular drive condition rather than have a harsh stiff ride the awd turbo be clearly the better choice of the two because of all that torque steer on the front drive model but you may have to go with a leftover or slightly use model for that price range tough decision rob fusi car and driver do a test with the same basic idea and choose the ford probe gt of course
