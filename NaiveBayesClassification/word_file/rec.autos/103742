from david david hwang subject re best radar detector in article troy troy wecker write let me explain why i feel the bogey counter feature be a gimmick radar wave bounce off object especially metal that be how radar speed measurement work a high frequency microwave x band approx ghz and k be approx ghz be send out and reflect back to the antenna off of an automobile or other object if an object be move a doppler shift about hz per mph on x band occur be measure and convert to mile per hmy these wave bounce all over the place and they can reflect many time and go in many direction from what i understand the can only tell if these microwave be come from the front rear or both there be only two antenna if they be come from both thi in interpret a a side bogey bogey count be determine a source by their relative strength to one another even if they be reflection of the same source i certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basi on which to make thi argument but do you answer ymy own question is the reflect signal shift at all from the act of be reflect if so would it then be easy for the detector to discriminate between reflection and direct source here be the problem since the microwave reflect how do the unit tell if it be a source or a reflection take a and drive to the local grocery store that use an x-band radar door opener you can tell by the small black box above the door point down at about a degree angle and ymy detector go off when it get near the will count or bogey from all direction front rear and side it do say which side the count change a car drive by and reflection change is there or source not at the store i go to a i drive around with a standard detector i can only find one source and that be the door opener for the front door troy wecker troy sequent computer system beaverton or david w hwang david
