from sam swett ssbc subject re review ford tauru sho excerpt from re review ford tauru by mark w rice in article dav id bond write gk occasionally i have trouble shift into reverse the shifter gk refuse to enter the gate and i often grind the synchro try to gk get it into gear i be watch thi carefully in the next couple gk of month enter wait second and then go into reverse they use the same synchro and you never at least i have ground-em-to-fit when use thi technique or do like the manual say and put it in first then you can quickly go into reverse no wait one more way which work in manual tran car i drive and it be my personal favorite the other suggestion above be great but try thi one too while push the shifter gently toward reverse let the clutch out slowly right to the friction point and the shifter will be pull into position if you do it right the car wo jump backward nor will the gear grind you will just glide back sam
