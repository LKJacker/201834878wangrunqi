from hhm subject re braindead driver who do look ahead i agree that if traffic be all block up and you want to pa you might not feel like move over for someone behind you because you do want to give them that one car-length when they should just wait like you be but if you one of those person that just sit behind the person and do flash them with the high beam or pull leave and flash them or ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to go by and you not just draft them then get the hell out of the way of someone who will i especially hate it when you flash someone at the back of a line and they do it on and there also the issue of some car be more intimidate to get person out of the way than other for instance gt look pretty mean in a rearview mirror at night with the foglight on there have be plenty of time when i break up a pack that a second-in-line hyundai ha be behind for mile you just need to know how to get their attention i like to see you use thi method on a couple of semi driver if they see you they usually acknowledge by stick their hand out the window with their middle finger extend because it be also obviou to them that there be no clear lane ahead
