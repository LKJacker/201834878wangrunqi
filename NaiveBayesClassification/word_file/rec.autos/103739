from johnn john navitsky subject re ford probe opinion center around the gt in article heiser bill heiser write in article chuck chuck kesler write jeremy g merenes zonker say can anyone offer any opinion of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair record reliability mileage etc i find mine probe gt to do quite well window problem delete artical ha be trim i have have my probe look at twice by my local dealer where i purchase the car the first time they make thi problem worse the second time after advise them of the service bulletin mention on my ford-probe mail list they say they do know of the bulletin they adjust the window and make it much better however it now make a scritch scritch noise on rough road and still squeal when i the window in wet weather anyone else do thi i not have any of the air or leakage problem that have be report but do get the squeal that bill describe i live in seattle so the wet weather may be a factor ford only gife key with the car ford spend an extra few penny if i recall correctly i get two key horn button behind air bag in speak and not in center personal preference button be terrible thi be true i wonder if thi may be a safety concern ie if person pound on the place where the airbag life speaking of the horn i wa surprise to find that the probe come with one of those nice sound horn instead of the japanese sound kind the previou probe have japanese horn no opinion transmission the speed be a must i have alway be a guy almost every car i ever own ha be a because i get a good deal on thi car with the mile i knowingly overlook the fact that it ha an automatic but it be a pretty high-tech automatic it be a fully electronicaly control with the speed be much more fun we opt for the automatic for a number of reason but it still fun and in some way more practical no noise when go over still ditto shake and rattle ha be my main gripe i get them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpourus of rattle when it get older i too would suspect that thi may be true tire goodyear eagle leave hop for very very very well it stick to the road like glue even on a rough surface ye interior be very very nice too very please to the eye and ergonomically sound definitely do a very very nice job on thi one the car ha a much more expensive than it actually be look and feel to it ditto ye thi car stiff suspension be for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i strongly suggest look into the agree check it out i do mind it but would say that if it wa much stiffer it might be a problem how about the for suspension well i would encourage passenger-carrying in the probe unles the person in the front seat like to sit with hi knee to the dash a mention in the consumer report write-up consider the back seat a a parcel shelf no biggie to me though if it have be i not have buy the car but it definitely not a family car true i hear that the exhaust system ha trouble but mine work fine i have hear about thi one i know that some of the very early probe and maybe have problem with prematurely rust muffler which i have thi problem and read about it or at least i assume the one i have wa the one i read about in any case what happen wa the weld between the muffler and the pipe feed it ok so i not a mechanic break in my case the dealer weld it order replacement part and put them on when they get them i suspect thi be some sort of design flaw or production flaw in any case i have an earlier model and would expect it to be work out on newer one in any case it be a warrantee repair or they get the key back from what i hear it sound like have some qc problem with the probe and probably when they first go into production but i think these problem have mostly be correct at thi point that almost alway to be expect with a completely new car like thi though i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm but i seriously feel the car design be sound and expect it to do very well i second thi there seem to be some thing that slip through but the car seem very sound while not perfection what be you get an awful lot for ymy money bill heiser heiser heiser boston university boston ma btw bill ha a probe mail list you might want to subscribe to it if you be interest in more detail try request-ford-probe do i get that right never can remember if the request go on the front or the back john navitsky johnn exercise a right today
