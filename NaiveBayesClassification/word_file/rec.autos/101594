from boyle craig boyle subject re integra gsr in article demostheni a zeppo write in article jonc j on cochran write i like to add the berettum gtz a a car which will kick gs-r butt anyday and it a lot cheaper to boot comparing the gtz and gsr be apple to orange somewhat like a mustang and a crx both have very different way of do thing and ought to appeal to different buyer i do think an acura owner would be see dead in a chevy dealership or vice versa stuff delete be all weather not to mention that the integra ride alot better than no integra i have see come with all-season tire the gtz do come with much bigger wheel along with the integra and the car do that with small inch tire that ymy acceleartion time also vary magazine to magazine road track and car driver have the gs-r at to for road and track the figure be almost certainly bogu and base on a hot prototype supply by acura the mt figure be more plausible also quarter mile time vary from to sound reasonable probably faster than regular integra so the berettum can out handle the integra and it can certainly keep up with it in acceleration and the berettum probably ha a higher top speed due to the horsepower advantage for the integra v for the berettum you alway believe those exact number why do you drive a gs-r and see for ymy self while the gs-r ha a low torqye it high gear over a the gsr gear be horrible for day to day drive it need a speed box more than any other modern car essentially in a regualr integra equal in the gsr and the regular integra be very buzzy at speed rpm make up for the difference still would call it a torque moster though considering you save almost dollar for the berettum and the be a reliable engine it do make sense to get the integra a a the only person i know with a gtz have it buy back by gm a a lemon it wa a piecve of junk but very quick for fwd quad reliable yeah what ymy definition of reliable if that reliable then it safe to say that integra engine in general be near perfect the only gsr owner i know have the engine throw a rod with le than mile a rare screw up by honda both the gtz and gsr be flaw car the performance enthusiast would take the gtz and the cr purchase would be the gsr craig
