from albion h bower subject re is car saftey important s in a previou article jimf jim frost say jnielsen john f nielsen write in article jimf jim frost write tcorkum trevor corkum write i figure that collision into brick wall be common enough for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there be lot of low-speed collision that do worry me get into an mph accident and you may reconsider i be in one and it be really scarey my life be something i value more than a car look or handeling consider it insurance it may not happen often but when it do you sure be glad you get a safe car granted the test be perfect but i much rather be in a car that do well in the test than a car that do horribly you raise a valid point but again it a tradeoff how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection you could buy a volvo saab or and get really good crash protection and other luxury but you pay significantly more for it in my case it out of the question because all of those car be beyond my budget i be in two major auto accident both be multiple car the worst wa a head-on three car collision t intersection and one person run a stop sign in both case i wa stop and have no place to go and i saw it come both time even in high-speed head-on collision the most beneficial item you can have be a good old seatbelt nowaday at least in the u you get an airbag if you get a belt so presumably you get an add safety benefit there a well that something i certainly look for and which can be have in inexpensive car if you really want to add safety to any car simply add a cage to the car they be available and cheap about in the usa add to that fmy or five or six point belt and you will walk away from collision that be otherwise not survivable but instead of person spend a little extra money we get legislation that say the must mandate a minimal level of protection for everyone one other significant factor in improve one own safety be to get some train thi will improve ymy safety more than any other single investment will defensively and that do not mean you have to be a dodder old stick in the mud person here tend to enthuse about auto more than the average probably in the top percentile in drive ability but still we sometime overlook the obviou i be to two drive school and three rid school for my motorcycle a very worthwhile investment and beside it wa a lot of fun too safety be what you make of it just because a carmaker do provide you with an adequate level of protection do mean you have to leave it go at that al bower dod alfa ducatus hobie kottke iaido nasa well goodnes sake do you know that girl ca play guitar mary chapin-carpenter
