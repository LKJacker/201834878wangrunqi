from zowie craig powderkeg deforest subject re or in article foo brad thone wuvmd write well there be a difference i do happen to have my sa manual handy but oil viscosity in general decrease with temperature the sa number be base on a typical curve that oil use to all have run from say the viscosity of a room-temperature at down to say that of a room-temperature at for a typical oil oil that be design for operation in normal temperature just have a weight specification oil that be design for operation in exceedingly cold temperature have a w tack on the end so in winter in a cold place you stick in ymy car in the winter and in it in the summer to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year modern multi-viscosity oil change viscosity much le with temperature a a result their viscosity graph cro over several curf a multi-vi specification peg the curve at two temperature a normal operate temperature and a cold one though i ca remember the number in any event the weight do indicate a significant difference remember that ymy engine be temperature-regulated by the thermostat and radiator or air fin most of the time unles you overheat it or something any weight of oil be better than no oil or than very old carbonize oil thin oil wo in general lubricate a well at temperature thicker oil will like a will lubricate better at temperature but not a well during startup when most engine wear occur if you plan on make long drife the be probably fine esp in the summer in ymy car but if you make short drife stick to the do drink soap dilute dilute ok
