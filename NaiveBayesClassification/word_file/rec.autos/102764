from welty richard welty subject frequently asked question archive-name thi article be one of a pair of article contain commonly ask automotive question the other article contain question more gear to the automotive enthusiast and so be not crossposted to rpw change a of april revise brake fluid section a non-silicone fluid be now apparently available rpw commonly asked automotive question tire question q what do the funny number on the side of my tire mean a typically you will see something like the be the overall width of the tire in millimeter the tread be usually narrower the be the aspect ratio it indicate the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width my example tire ha a sidewall height of mm the be the wheel diameter in inch there be also some special tire call trx tire which have three digit metric wheel diameter designation like which be in millimeter the r mean radial and the h be a speed rat indicate the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflate and carry an appropriate load may safely operate common speed rat be s t h and v up to recent change to the method for specify tire size move the speed rat to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designation like the indicate the per-tire load associate with the speed rat exceed thi load in continuou operation at the rat speed be dangerou practice what follow be a table show a number of load index and correspond maximum per-tire load load index max load kg note that the usual ma v weight confusion occur in thi table in some case the letter p or lt may be find in front of a tire size the lt designation indicate light truck and the p designation indicate passenger car if no letter be give then the application of the tire be passenger car usage a far a i know these letter only appear in the u market the lt designation be prinicipally of interest to owner of light truck and other utility vehicle for the owner of a passenger vehicle there be no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all if the aspect ratio be omit it be probably but may be tire with an m designation may have their speed rat reduce by about there be an additional set of rat on tire for temperature traction and treadwear temperature and traction be grade a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear be a numeric rat these value be of limit value a they be assign somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturer and be thu not useful in compare different brand of tire q my car ha tire with a funny size designation can i put normal tire on the car a ymy tire be call trx tire they be devise by michelin because of a somewhat different bead design they be incompatible with normal tire michelin use a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mount on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tire could not be mount on trx type wheel you will need to aquire different wheel to put a normal tire on ymy car it be barely possible to fit normal tire on trx wheel and horribly dangerou to do so the tire may simply peel off the rim in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed trx type tire be become hard to find in addition to michelin avon make suitable tire goodyear ha apparently discontinue their line of trx tire q can i rotate radial from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car a car and tire manufacturer have differ view on thi subject many say that swap radial between the leave and right hand side of a car be now ok thi group include michelin and goodyear other for example pirelli and nokium will void warranty if such swap be do the best advice be to read ymy tire manual carefully before rotate ymy tire and stick to the manufacturer recommendation q how many snow tire should i buy and if i buy which end of the car should i put them on a in short and both end to explain many driver in area that do get excessive snow or who do drive agressively or at all in snow condition get away with only two snow on the drive wheel but there be circumstance where thi can be dangerou practice with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between be able to start the car go a function of the rear axle or stop and turn the car a function of the front axle in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primary risk of put the snow tire on the front only be that if you have to put on the brake while go downhill you run a seriou risk of go downhill backward radar detector and speed limit q why be there any comment on radar detector and speed limit in thi q a post a because question about detector and speed limit crossposted between and alway start long tediou and pointles flame war if you want to talk about either of these topic please subscribe to or and keep it there safety equipment q do airbag really work a preliminary statistic suggest the follow airbag work much better than no belt good point belt alone work much better than airbag alone and airbag point belt work slightly better than point belt alone the con to airbag be that some design tend to burn the driver hand when vent the byproduct of the explosion that occur inside the bag and that some design but not all may knock the driver hand from the wheel make retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflate more difficult brake question q do i alway need to get the rotor on my disk brake turn mida alway want to do thi a no there be specific condition that mandate turn or replace rotor some shop try and make a little extra money by replace rotor more often than be strictly necessary if the rotor be not warp warp and only lightly groove then there be no need to replace or to turn them note also that some rotor the rotor on many honda be a good example be so narrow to begin with that it be not practical to turn them they must be replace when they become too thin warp or badly groove q they tell me i should downshift when brake to slow my car down is thi really a good idea a it use to be a very good idea back in the day of mediocre fade prone drum brake in modern disc brake equip car use of downshifting to slow the car be not really necessary except in case of long steep downhill run otherwise modern disc brake be more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstance and they be much cheaper to repair than clutch line on the other hand many standard driver license test in the usa still specify that the driver be test downshift under brake i suggest that before take a u driver test you either learn to do thi smoothly which take some time and practice or borrow a car with an automatic to take the test q how often should i replace my brake fluid a probably more often than you do traditional brake fluid tend to absorb water thi water can corrode internal part of the brake system and also lower the boil point of the fluid type be older fluid and be newer specification the principal difference be in wet and dry boil point the dry boil point be important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boil point be important in older brake fluid fluid have the lowest wet and dry boil point requirement fluid have better boil point requirement and fluid have the best boil point requirement but fluid be not clearly superior see the next q a for more detail while the requirement imply that fluid be better than fluid there may be specific case where a fluid be preferable but these be mostly competition application otherwise type fluid offer much improve brake pedal feel replacement once a year be recommend for fluid although agressive driver may profit by change out fluid more frequently or at least bleed a modest amount of fluid out of the brake caliper fairly regularly q what about brake fluid a thi break down in to two part the specification look excellent for performance but the first fluid be silicone base silicone fluid be a tricky proposition unlike and fluid they do not absorb water at all while thi may sound like a feature the problem be that any water present pool up in such system interfere with brake performance and corrode any metal at the spot where the pool be occur the water will tend to migrate downward in the brake system to the brake caliper where most of the corrosion occur because of thi phenomenon it be essential when convert to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replace all rubber part in the brake system when convert to silicone fluid two other issue that come up with silicone fluid they be difficult to pmy cleanly that be without air bubble which interfere with get a good brake pedal feel and while they generally have much higher boil point than fluid they do have high temperature failure mode which be indistinguishable in effect from boil fluid silicone fluid may make sense in some street car application but they be certainly not recommend for high performance drive application and the economic be questionable for street use i have recently become aware of new fluid that meet the standard that do not contain silicone these fluid appear to be reasonably compatible with the older and fluid but i have little information at thi time q ab be available on some of the car i look at but it cost more is it worth it a thi do not have a cut and dry answer therefore thi answer will be quite long in order to cover the pro and con the short answer be that ab cost more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver that be to say a driver who do not have extensive experience in high performance drive technique and may require the unlearn of some obsolete brake technique like pump brake which should be unlearn in any case now for the long answer ab work by monitering the wheel of the car look for sign of lock brake it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheel there be several system on the market it can not detect impend lockup which be what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup the sensor use vary some of the le well design sensor be sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviate from original equipment or oe-equivalent component when the sensor detect lockup the ab system respond by unlock the brake either individually or all at once depend on the system if the driver keep their foot firmly plant the ab will end up cycle between the lock and unlock state if a sensor exist that could detect impend lockup then we could sit right at that point which be where maximum brake effect be achieve thi pulse can often be felt in the brake pedal a the system cycle the percentage of the time that the brake be truly engage be call the duty cycle typically in an ab system thi be about on dry pavement a train driver can beat thi duty cycle quite reliably use a technique call threshold brake on wet pavement brake be so chancy that ab will outperform threshold brake nearly every time unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum brake effect can be acheived with the brake lock only audi of the manufacturer produce abs-equipped car ha see fit to provide a disable switch for the ab system for thi eventuality a particularly important feature of ab be that it preserve steer control thi be the case simply because if you be brake near the limit and turn the wheel the ab will release the brake if it see steering-triggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brake be apply braking distance will lengthen accordingly an important caution ab can not exceed the maximum theoretical brake force in any give situation if you start slide on glare ice do expect an ab system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction be not change by the presence of an ab system in ymy car a far a maintenence go in addition to the potential restriction i list above you have to worry about the follow part cost be much higher the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan list for but the oe master cylinder for the abs-equipped version of the same car list for over most manufacturer explicitly forbid use of silicone brake fluid in abs-equipped vehicle because of the potential cost of replacement of corrode brake system component regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid become very important q what about thi threshold brake busines a normally i not put thi in the consumer q a but recent publicity about a number of accident involve polouse driver in abs-equipped chevy caprice suggest that thi section be need here rpw threshold brake be a technique practice by all seriou high performance driver if make a habit it replace the stab the pedal and lock up panic habit entirely and be much to be prefer basically the premise be that tire generate maximum brake force when they have just start to slide but just before the wheel lock up entirely driver who threshold brake learn to feel what thi threshold feel like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal in many car you can feel that you be near the threshold when the pedal start to firm up a you depres it in any case if you ca hear the tire whine just a bite you not very near the threshold in a car with ab often there be a twinge in the pedal just before the system start cycle if the driver back off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge be felt then they be very close to the threshold and they probably achieve better stop distance than if they just punch it and let the ab take over recently there ha be a rash of publicity over a number of accident and one death involve polouse car equip with ab system the polouse department in question quickly blame the new ab system but accord to autoweek magazine it now seem clear that the problem wa a lack of train none of the involve officer have any recent performance drive train there be reason to believe that the driver react to the pulse brake pedal by pump brake an old and discredit technique of stab and release the brake pedal the goal be to try and get brake back with a fail hydraulic system if you think about it for a minute you realize that pump brake must cut the effective operation of a work brake system by at least so if you cut the duty cycle of an ab system by that much you be give up most of ymy brake for the wrong reason threshold brake ha the advantage in that it be an effective and useful technique regardles of whether ymy car ha ab if you do fear a fail hydraulic system then one or two stab at the pedal will be sufficient ga question q do high octane gasoline help a maybe maybe not some car have knock sensor and can adjust the engine time or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline be use on most car however you should use the cheapest ga that make ymy car run well check ymy owner manual for detail on what ymy car need q my car wa make for lead gasoline will unleaded ga hurt it a it be possible that unleaded ga may slightly increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argue otherwise the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however a modern lead gasoline actually contain very little lead you should however check ymy owner manual many car from the early do not actually require lead gasoline q do fuel treatment help what kind should i use a some do and some do during the winter it be a good idea to use dry ga however some may be harmful to fuel injection system never use an additive contain methanol sometime call methyl alcohol such additive may damage fuel system in car with carb and almost certainly will damage car with fuel injection manufacturer opinion vary on additive contain ethanol sometime call ethyl alcohol if ymy car ha fuel injection check the owner manual on ymy car before use these most manufacturer consider ethanol acceptable in gasoline additive with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillate be fine in fuel inject car an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner be helpful in car with fuel injector although many premium gasoline contain detergent that do the same job some off brand of fuel injector cleaner contain ethanol or methanol alway check the ingredient before put anything in ymy ga tank there be a small number of particularly good additive these be noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill one but work much much better among these be chevron techron redline wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg a bottle of one of these once every six month be highly recommend q what about detergent gasoline a the quality of detergent package in gasoline vary somewhat bmw ha institute a test program and gasoline brand which pa thi test may advertise that fact sticker indicate passage of the test be now begin to appear on fuel pump at ga station if such gasoline be use then fuel injector cleaner be probably optional beforewarned that while use of bmw approve gasoline will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposit lubrication question q what do the number and letter in a motor oil designation mean a there be several different item encode there be a two-letter code indicate the type of detergent package that the manufacturer use in the oil thi look like se sf cd or such the s code be for gasoline engine application the c code be for diesel engine application the second letter be assign in sequence a new level of protection be develop thu sf be consider better than se se be consider better than sd and so forth the more noticeable designation be the oil weight thi be either a single number weight or a pair of number separate by the letter w the latter type be much more commonly use these day and be the only type that most automobile manufacturer specify in operator manual the first number in the designation be the apparent viscosity of the oil when it be cold the w stand for winter the second number be the viscosity of the oil when hot there be a trick here the oil do actually get thicker turn from weight to weight a it get hotter what be actually happen be that when the oil be cold it ha the viscosity of a cold weight oil a it get hotter it do get thin a fast a a oil would by the time it be up to temperature it ha the viscosity of a hot weight oil note that these number actually specify range of viscosity not all oil have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all weight oil have the same viscosity when hot note also that the novel behavimy of multi-grade oil be cause by additive and it ha be report that with the sole exception of castrol gtx oil do not retain their multi-grade characteristic well over time and oil work very well though q are quick lube place any good a some do adequate work but there be quite a few incompetent one out there let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they do overtorque the oil drain plug and keep ymy hand on ymy wallet at all time q are oil additive like or tufoil any good a and tufoil be ptfe-based additive many of these have come onto the market recently they be different from the moly-based additive that have be around since the early ptfe be the chemical name for teflon tm a trademark own by dupont in general auto manufacturer do not recommend use of these product most usenet response to question on these additive be favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother rev but long term result whether ptfe additive be effective after mile be debatable some manufacturer such a saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceed application cause deterioration of the oil seal and eventual leakage some bmw owner have report death of valve seal shortly after the addition of slick to their car thi writer ha be caution by a dealer that should not be use in japanese motor a it may clog the oil return passage in the engine otherwise there be no know report of damage cause by ptfe additive on the other hand there be satified slick customer in the world q do synthetic oil really work a ye but more specifically most auto manufactuer accept synthetic but disagree with the extremely long oil change interval claim by oil manufacturer auto manufacturer recommend that you continue to change oil at the interval recommend in the owner manual for ymy car even if you decide to try the longer interval at least change the oil filter at regular interval a synthetic get just a dirty a conventional oil synthetic gear lubricant for manual transmission be another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip be very highly regard and very effective mobil synthetic gear lube get mix review however q manufacturer be specify longer and longer oil change interval how often should i change my oil a it depend on how you drive if ymy car alway or nearly alway get warm up and you do drive it very hard and keep the rev down the manufacturer recommendation be probably fine if however you drive it hard drive it at high rev or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it do get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhap at mile interval give that most manufacturer be now specify mile interval if you do drive ymy car much at all say mile a year then you probably want to change oil every six month anyway if you be store a car during the winter then change oil before store it and change oil when you bring it out of storage misc question q my car ha a time belt i hear that bad thing happen when they break what the story a it depend on the internal design of the motor early ford escort for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt break but the newer car will just require a tow and installation of a new belt some honda motor will not be damage but other will be if no replacement interval be specify for ymy car then change the belt at least every mile some car may require more frequent replacement ask ymy dealer or independent mechanic also ask if there be any relate repair that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escort that suffer valve damage also have a time belt drive water pump which ha be know to seize destroy the time belt and which then cause major valve damage a a side effect replacing the time belt while ignore the water pump can be a costly mistake q why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destruct when the time belt break a for performance reason compromising piston design so that the valf and piston will not collide require that the compression ratio of the engine be reduce significantly thi be why you be more likely to avoid valve damage in economy car than in performance orient vehicle q what cause unintended acceleration a the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration conclude that unintended acceleration could not be cause by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence the nhtsa report go on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator be probably the cause richard welty welty nothing good ha ever be report about the full rotation of a race car about either it pitch or roll axi carroll smith
