from subject re best radar detector i have a valentine for about month now and i agree that it be the best det ector available the point here be trust and reliability i be able to tr ust the valentine more than any other detector i owend if the valentine sa y that there be a moderate to strong radar source in front of me then it mo re than likely to be a speed trap with my other detector i get so many false that i begin to ignore someo of the warn because i do want t o drive like i have one foot on the brake and one on the ga pedal that directional indicator really really help plu more info be almost alwa y better than le info no matter how smart radar detector get the human br ain be usually smarter so if i go to make a decisio base on information at hand i want all the info i can get plu if you divide the overall streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogey report you find that each bogey be pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat with other detector yo u just get one strong warn my logic may be faulty on thi but i think i t work okay although i must admit that i have really notice the reflection problem of one radar souce thoma
