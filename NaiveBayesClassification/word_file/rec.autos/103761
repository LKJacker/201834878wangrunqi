from tedebear theodore chen subject re plymouth shadow experience in article raman balaji v ramanathan write the part about spend on repair remind me of an article i read in a magazine compare the year ownership cost of a toyotum camry and a ford tauru or something like that the result which they announce with great flourish wa that it cost the same at the end of the period that wa their argument to prove that you do go wrong buy the ford tauru over the camry now if i remember correctly the camry cost about or so more in initial cost essentially it mean that you spend about extra on repair on the tauru that be ridiculou every time ymy car need repair it be extra hassle los of time and a dozen other thing i would much rather spend more in initial cost than spend more in repair cost do you account for depreciation i seriously doubt that a tauru would rack up an extra in repair cost over year teddy
