from ssave the devil reincarnate subject re wa re safety from how far can you see a car in article simnet mark r poulson write ssave the devil reincarnate write you will be surprise at the number of person who forget their glass while drive and then there be the person who just plain do get their eye check once a year a someone who ha lousy vision i can see object at a distance without my glass however they be quite fuzzy and i may not be able to make out the detail but i can certainly tell that something be there i wo argue too much about anything i be probably one of those that think that we ca have enough safety on the road i would gladly sacrifice distraction a you call it than someone have trouble see danger earlier one save life justify more than my lifetime of distraction for me and then there be dawn and dusk when ymy eye have not yet adjust to the poor light and there be those who drive car and then there be the case where you be drive down a two-way one lane road and someone be overtake car and come the opposite direction do see you because ymy light be not on or vice versa at that be quite a small reaction time but of course we be too macho to think we be invincible and can react faster than that only the poor sod who you do see might not have a normal life ever i work out the reaction time in a previou post and it plenty even for an year old grandma a long a speed be in the mph range or le if you or some other driver be go way faster than that then be careful a alway you be responsible for ymy drive action if you pull out to pa and crash into someone for whatever reason it ymy fault if you ca problem be that i may just kill the guy i agree that i would be at fault and i will have my license revoke why i might even go to the ga chamber but the fact still remain that the guy be dead someone die because i wa too stingy to put on my light see a damn thing then you should be drive light fail fall tree or rock do have light etc i maintain that headlight strength the ratio of the probability of fall on the road to oncoming traffic be too low to even be consider the difference be also work on what we know could happen to what might happen run light be not necessary for motorist who drive around it may be a good idea to force the run or headlight on when you turn ymy windshield wiper on but only because some person be too stupid to do so if you crash into one of those idiot you have to fight it out in court to show hi neglegence if you can even prove it just out of curiosity how much gas-milage do you loose when you put ymy light on and how much do you reduce the life of ymy head-lamp and what be the cost of ymy headlamp anyway mileage be certainly reduce but by a very very small amount probably about watt for head and run light thi be an extra horsepower that must be make by the engine it may be that thi will cost you around two gallon a year but time million car that a lot of ga compared to the number of gallon of ga consume by those million car it be miniscule whatever be a pity i have to share the same road with a person not concern with safety s ssave lamp life be measure in hour so if you normally drive in half daylight and half night ymy lamp will have to be replace twice a often headlamp only cost about for most halogen lamp the cost to the individual be trivial and to me be not the issue what i do like be the distraction all these car with headlight cause i do need to constantly see the headlight of the vehicle behind me i do need to see the headlight of every gosh darn car for a mile down the road these light up car make non-illuminated thing les visible like pedistrian and bike hopefully we not go to mandate drl for person and bike too a stream of taillight be tolerable a be the orange front run light thi be certainly sufficient for other person to see you if they look and do distract me nearly a much a full power headlight mark
