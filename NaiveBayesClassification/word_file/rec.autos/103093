from gwm gary w mahan subject re it a rush wa re too fast why should a good driver be terrify at the only thing i fear go at be driver who switch to the leave lane without use either rear-view-mirror or flasher doing to ai a rush for me but it fun and i get where i want to go much faster in defense of the driver who be in the right lane here in the state person simply do not expect when they be drive to be overtake at a speed differential of i do think thi be because they be stupid of course there be exception they be just program because of the limit do you in the state when you look in the rear-view alway calculate future position of car base on a speed differential dont get me wrong i love to drive in the leave lane fast but when i overtake car who be on the right i slow down a tad bite if i be to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential i would be the stupid one btw if no one else be around then go for it
