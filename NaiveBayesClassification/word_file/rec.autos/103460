from steven ritter subject re pennsylvanium insurance limited tort option in my opinion the limit tort option be the best thing casey ha ever do basically limit tort mean that you give up ymy right to sue for pain and suffer unles one of the follow condition be meet ymy medical bill result from the accident exceed x where x be some number like i not sure of the exact number the accident wa cause by a drink driver i mean the other driver wa drink you get a good lawyer and have a good case basically you can appeal to regain ymy right to sue but there almost no chance of thi ever happen you be only give up ymy right to sue for pain and suffer you can still sue for medical cost actual damage etc by agree to limit tort you be essentially give up ymy right to be an asshole who treat every accident a an entry into the litigation lottery in exchange you get a substantial reduction in ymy rate i save unfortunately the insurance company have manage to scare and confuse person so much that only about of pennsylvanian go for limit tort i gues that ok if more person opt for it the insurance company would be push harder for repeal
