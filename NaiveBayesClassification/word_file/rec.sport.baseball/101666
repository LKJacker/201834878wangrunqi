subject re eck v rickey wa re rickey whine again from smith brian smith in article genetic david m tate write i read all of the followup to thi but i think i go back to the original article to make specific comment about the method jao john oswalt say he ha obtain the play by play record in computer readable form for every major league baseball game for the past several year he devise an algorithm which i call sum-over-situations and write a computer program to calculate every major league player contribution use it it work like thi look at every situation in every game in a baseball season a situation be determine by inning score where the baserunner be and how many out there be for each situation count how many time the team eventually win the game that the situation occur in and divide by the number of time the situation come up to come up with a value for that situation thi wa first do by george lindsey in the late and report in article an investigation of strategy in baseball author george r lindsey journal operation research issue volume july-august pp later pete palmer do the same thing use simulate season to generate a larger set of datum to avoid the kind of small-sample anomaly that other person have worry about he report thi in with john thorn gary skoog modify the method a bite and do some work on what he call a value added measure base on these situational value hi be base directly on marginal run though not on win probability these result a apply to the season be report in one of the bill jame baseball abstract book help me out here somebody for example a situation might be inning score runner on second and no out there be regular season major league game last year with the rocky and marlin there will be more thi year say thi situation come up in of those and the team ahead win of them then the value of thi situation be description of method look at change in win probability base on the at bat plu any baserunning and the player by that amount each time he get a plate appearance now for each player sum up all hi at-bat and base-running value for the season to obtain an overall value for that player obviously the sum of all player value for each game and for the season a a whole will be that only because you alway credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher there no validation involve ok there a very big problem here that nobody ha yet comment on you add probability and probability do add run you can add the total team run break down into how many run joe contribute plu how many run fred contribute etc but probability do work that way if bob increase hi team chance of win by in each of pa that do not mean that bob increase hi team chance of win by in fact it do mean anything because the unit be screwy i agree and disagree john be say that the batter effort will result in more win then loss while you be probably correct that do not mean more win then loss it mean something i would rather have a player who increase my team chance of win by in each of pa then i would a player who increase my chance of win by in each of pa thu there appear to me to be an obviou positive association between john statistic and win game thu before you disregard thi stat it appear to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there be consider an example bob hit a solo hr in the bottom of the first about on ymy scale he do the same thing again in the fourth with the score tie for another and again in the seventh with the score tie for another and finally in the ninth to win the game by a score of for a value of bob hit solo hr in plate appearance and wa credit by ymy method with but what do that mean wa bob responsible for the win certainly not the defense be alway responsible if you include pitch in that and bob wa pitch in fact bob wa only of the offense which be a lot but not even close to furthermore what about the other team run say they all come on solo hr by fred then fred wa hit hr to tie up the game which be just a valuable a hr to take the lead see lindsey and fred will himself have accrue a good rat or so so fred and bob combine have amass of a win in one game there clearly a problem here the only problem here be an insistance that these number mean exactly how many win the team ha first we be use average over many season and apply them to one game second remember some player performance take away from the chance of you win that be a player who get an out get a negative probability in most case thu i not sure in any give game when you add up all the number for a team who win that they will add up to in that game sometime they will add up to more then one sometime le than one also the pitcher bad performance give up run may have give them a large negative percentage for that game also any batter that pull an night would give large negative greg think about the right thing but hi intuition be off the mark closer be enormously important the total number of run value be outweigh by when they come or be prevent from comming the double which greg allow be not enough in another article i propose a test of thi we can predict a team record quite accurately by look at how many run total they score and allow without regard to when those run score in the game if late run be really more important than early run then look only at late run should lead to a better predictor right no but really only because you have a smaller sample size i would think however that the number of run you score in the first inning would be just a good a a prediction a how many run you score in the last inning and realize something else a closer usually come in in a close situation not a blow out it be hard to argue that any run that a closer gife up in a game have equal importance to those give up in the first inning look a closer give up run often mean a team will lose many game on the other hand a starter who gife up run often still leaf hi team a chance to win the offence ha many more out to do something about but i be not say all late inning situation be equally important either if i be down run in the ninth it really do not matter how many run my pitcher gife up in the ninth here another think experiment apply thi method to basketball what you find be that point score in the first half of the game have almost exactly no value because no lead be safe with an entire half yet to play furthermore the sub in off the bench who sink the win free throw with no time on the clock get a for the game while the star forward who score point in the first half before sprain hi ankle get a zero do thi make sense no but why would you assume that the team probability of win would be before the possesion in which the free throw be make look if you be down point with second leave there be a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you be in possesion of the ball and do not forget that somebody else miss shoot turnover foul bad defense etc cause a negative chance that the team would win from read all of the discussion on thi statistic i feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent be do so out of an agenda at first look thi statistic valadate clutchnes but it really do not cluthnes revolf around the idea that certain player in crucial situation elevate their performance and other performance go down i never see convince proof that thi really happen so if you assume there be no clutchnes then that mean that except for a lot of noice thi statistic ha a positive association to player performance there be a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchnes certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run be for example we may find for instance that a home run increase ymy chance of win by on average while a strikeout decrease ymy chance of win by i bet if thi be do we would find that thi statistic wa just a good a other statistic we have for predict win and loss how do we evaluate relief pitcher say john and sam have the exact same pitch statistic run earn run k bb etc both have exceptional number john however only pitch in closer situation while sam wa a mop up man who wa more valuble to their team probably john who wa the better pitcher they be probably about the same brian smith
