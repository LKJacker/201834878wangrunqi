from fierkelab eric roush subject re the mystery of ron gant in article fl forrest smith write in article msilverm mike silverman write o any of you expert want to analyze ron gant omeone sure need to analyze him gant be a head case in hi what six or seven year in the major he put together a combine total of maybe one good season he lack self-confidence but worse he do really understand baseball curiously he seem to perform best when hi job be threaten sit him down for a game and he might get a hit the next night but let him play and what be he think about getting hit drive in run no he worry if he go to get that steal basis or that career home run he appear to have no learn curve he never figure out how to play third base what a fiasco he still play the outfield with hi leg he lucky he so fast because it enable him to outrun hi mistake but a i suggest earlier in the season it look to me like he slow down a little bite or else every groundskeeper be water the infield dirt a little extra gant ha have way too much of a chance already he may get hot again for a couple of month but he alway revert to hi true level gant ml record age thi season year g ab ba obp slg hr sb cs base expt year in the major for part of season total play time approx season just look at hi hit record he have season of op greater than which be pretty good for an of hi season be pretty decent for a rookie the move to third base explain a lot of hi when he return a an of he begin hit again and of course last year he slump but no learn curve he ha obviously improve hi bat eye over the year a well a hi ratio a to hi field he wa an infielder when he wa draft a a he come up through the brave system and then the brave put him through position change in the space of a year he an adequate of although not great and at least some of ymy perception of hi field be color by watch him learn to play the of at the ml level i know you another long-term brave fan about play imo that the most difficult position to field after catcher at ss or you need more range and speed but at you get to have quick reflex and have a gun for an arm there be no second chance at even when play sandlot softball granted i still put my best overall infielder at ss but that because he get more chance not because the job be harder it still amaze me that so many team have try to convert other position player to but maybe that because the supply of natural be scarce finally gant be a player who put pressure on himself to perform well and work hard to improve you do get those amazingly huge arm on that relatively small body without a lot of weight work now whether he be overdo it these day may be a valid question a be the question of whether he try too hard to make something happen during each at-bat but frankly if a player be go to not live up to potential i much rather they fail by try too hard than by not try hard enough you might be able to teach relaxation to an adult but at that age i do believe you can teach hustle all that say i do think i sign gant to another long-term contract he now and i think he free-agent eligible in year when he be given hi career curve and limitation i would expect him to last much past a a ml ballplayer he might surprise me here but atlantum get some talent on the farm and i rather take my chance down the road with nieve et al eric
