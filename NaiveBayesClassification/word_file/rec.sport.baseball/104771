from tedward edward ted fischer subject re jack morri in article dave dave till write i do think it wa that obviou at the time that viola wa better morri and viola have comparable ratio in viola wa come off an injury wherea morri wa healthy at the time i do really want the sox to sign either i wa more than a little worry about viola elbow but you surely remember my shout of relief when after a week of rumor that morri wa come to the red sox they end up with viola instead now i even happier viola seem to have rebound nicely also morri wa will to sign for only two year the jay do like to sign pitcher to long-term contract which i think be a sensible policy how long do viola sign for three year i generally agree with their policy of avoid long-term contract for pitcher but i think they enforce it rather too strictly these day the premier pitcher all sign three or fmy year deal which leaf the jay with morri and stewart if the jay want to compete for top free agent pitcher they will have to accept greater risk any idea what the option year deal be for morri are there any automatic activation clause what be the buyout amount f cheer valentine
