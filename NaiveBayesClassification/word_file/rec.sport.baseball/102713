from david robert walker subject re young catcher most of thi discussion ha be between mark singer and david tate with valentine weigh in on the same side a dave at variou time my opinion fwiw to all mark age do matter ability do i would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league number than the veteran who ha prove himself to be average at best i do care if he be if he play better than what i have i want him out there sandy alomar have decent minor league number grossly inflate by the pcl in general and la vega in particular he should have be project a an average major league hitter which be good for a catcher i admit santiago number would probably come out the same a sandy but i do have the league datum from the to check it out that be say i agree with send lopez to richmond at least to start the season a the box below show he ha one minor league season in which he hit well he ha two in which he hit very very poorly i want to see that the lopez be real olson and berryhill be not complete mediocrity for catcher especially nl catcher they be essentially average hitter with equivalent average around if he have hit well at prior level i would say he belong on the brave but there be a reasonable chance that lopez last year wa just a much a fluke a alomar in or santiago in one year at any level at any age do satisfy my standard of evidence javier lopez bur dur grn atl maj min tot maj min tot on a similar note i do understand why more person be not supportive of neon deion granted i think hi behavior with mccarver last year wa completely bush last year wa the first time he ever get ab in one place so hi line be hard to read but he ha a combine op in minor league play with hi speed be more valuable than the op alone indicate and at a still young age have a monster year with an op he ha a total major and minor eqa of above major league average and above average for cf which wa about in the nl last year he ha show at least the potential of go into the which would make him one of the best hitter in the league he ha two full season before reach hi prime season of he should be consider a a legitimate prospect and not a a simple side-show attraction deion sander fla int ea nyy int nyy int atl ric atl maj min tot maj min tot clay d
