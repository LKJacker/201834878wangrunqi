from spira greg sarcasm is a way of life spira subject re relative value of player in kime edward kim write in article jle joe m leonard write before folk jump on me let me ask the net would the jay have win the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morri give hi run support how about an average ml pitcher i ca believe that morri performance in the playoff and series have a large positive impact on the jay performance i know it very trendy nowaday to dump on morri but let give credit where credit be due it be doubtful that the blue jay would have win the al east without morri well when you say without morri you have to mention an assume replacement if the alternative to morri wa let cito gaston soft-tos the ball underhand to the opposition every day then of course the blue jay would have win without morri if the alternative wa replacement level then i think it would be very close and ye morri might make the difference if the alternative wa frank viola the blue jay probably would have win more easily with viola last year when the team go for the month of august and all the other starter be be shell and milwaukee wa make a charge morri go with a pretty good era i ca remember exactly ye you can make the argument that the hi presence prevent the team from collapse in august also let not underestimate the importance hi inning to save the bullpen every fifth day if he do help u win the al east forget about the pennent and the world series those inning be probably helpful hi run support wa high run but so wa stottlemyer run and he win only game i do remember morri win an inordinate number of and ballgame but thi be to hi credit he pitch only a good a he need to be when he wa up in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and throw the ball up there and let the batter get themseleve out i hate thi expression an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out try to make perfect pitch to keep hi era down but morri be a veteran pitcher know that win be the only thing that really matter in baseball by save himself he wa able to reach back for that little extra i hate thi too when the game wa on the line well i think be complete b what happen most of the time be that morri fell behind and the team come back and rescue him mostly thi be because he a lousy inning pitcher and much better the rest of the way that the team can climb out of hole consistently and win them be not to morri credit it to the team credit furthermore while morri do exceed the w-l percentage that would be project from hi run allow and run support he ha do thi in previou year in fact hi w-l record in be a lot worse than what it project to be with run support and run allow do you think he just come up with thi ability in look at the postseason game he pitch decently in typical morri game morri get behind team rescue him he not responsible for that rescue and in both those game the team just do rescue him enough jack morri pitch a well a he do during much of the season in those game the offense just do earn him a victory btw i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrass a veteran pitcher which cito would never do but hi era be how much more can he be embarrass morri be one of those guy who will reture when he ca start anymore he too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen greg
