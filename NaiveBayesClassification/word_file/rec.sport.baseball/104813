from wyllie andrew wyllie subject re jay darrin jackson be a nightmare in article klinker eric klinker write in article thoma hyer ior write in article klinker eric klinker say dj wa a popular player in san diego derek bell wa not fare well in the clubhouse at toronto so no matter how bad he look now i still think it wa a steal for the jay just from the perspective of team chemistry i laugh at you now and i will laugh at you again equally publicly when the jay finish third due to the severe depletion of their talent the jay will finish third because of the depletion of their pitch staff not because derek bell wa trade for darrin jakson i could agree more the jay have a lot of power in their line-up so far pitch ha be the biggest problem maybe we can get acker back but anyway the point of my post if you miss it wa that derek bell wa trade because he wa basically in the doghouse with cito and the rest of the team one incident that stick out in my mind wa when derek bell run back out on to the feild after the jay have win the division and all the player be back in the clubhouse bell run around the field with hi arm in the air wave a big towel over hi head he look like a big jerk especially when you consider he do not contribute much to the team over the whole season the next day winfield and carter somehow get the key to bell jeep and bring it out on to the feild before the game start the stadium announcer say that there wa go to be a draw later in the game for bell jeep bell really freak out i do think bell wa to popular after that i think that jackson might be try a little too hard right now he know for be a great outfielder and he not the only blue jay who ha be boot ball and play generally awful andrew andrew wyllie wyllie mrc university of toronto
