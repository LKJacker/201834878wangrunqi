subject re best homerun from ian m derby i personally will never forget mike schmidt home run against the expo in that decide the nl east it wa also hi career high another home run that i think wa totally incredible wa in the alc the ca angle have the boston red sox strike away from the pennant until don baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run that wa the most incredible turn of event i have ever see in baseball the sox later take the pennant away only to have the same thing do to them in the ws against the met speaking of the met be it strange how the nlc that year with the astro almost mirror the nlc with the philly the astro have be painfully close twice i must admit
