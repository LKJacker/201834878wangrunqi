from ragraca randy a graca subject re how to speed up game marginally realistic davidm david madden write in article gary built like villanueva huckabay write you want to speed up ballgame mandate a rule permit only n second between pitch the current rule be too lenient and then enforce it fifteen second be more please pardon my ignorance if thi be well know but what be the current rule than enough time if the pitch be release in call it a ball and restart the clock i remember a post from last year indicate that a pitch clock wa try in one of the minor league some time back and do not work i do remember why they say that it do not work anyone remember thi jody mcdonnel on wip in phil ha be say that a pitch clock wa inevitable how would a pitch clock work on throw to first maybe we could limit the number of throw to first that the pitcher can make and award a balk if he exceed it i have another question who would operate the pitch clock one of the umpire add another one to the crew another pair of suggestion remove the balk rule it be the runner responsibility to stay safe no matter what the pitcher do i not sure i like thi idea i think it would severely diminish the number of steal basis and limit the availability of such neat strategic ploy a the hit and run and the squeeze play one of my personal favorite if a pitcher throw to an occupy base more than x time x to without successfully pick off the runner the runner advance a base a if walk ahhh i suppose i should read the whole article before i hit the key eh obviously from what i write above i like thi idea the no-balk seem to give the pitcher the advantage the base-walk allow the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base it may also increase the number of wild throw to the bag since the pitcher know he do have very many chance to pick off the runner so he may hurry too much i rather see run score a the result of sound hit and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppines that could result from thi kind of rule so i suppose there be some disadvantage to that idea too baseball game take about in the nl and just a shade under hour in the al that just too damn long i do like to play in hmy game much le watch a game for that long my butt fall asleep and if i watch on tv i channel surf between pitch catch colorize version of mr ed leave it to beaver and those wacky nieporent on nick at nite i too find myself surf when i know that it will be enough time between each pitch to allow the batter to adjust hi jewlery i remember in little league if when up to bat we step out of the batter box even for a moment we be automatically out that may be a little harsh for the major but seriously how about put a limit on the batter be able to step out take several dozen practice swing pound their shoe scratch their ball etc maybe force them to stay in the batter box would be such a bad idea that could save a few minute randy
