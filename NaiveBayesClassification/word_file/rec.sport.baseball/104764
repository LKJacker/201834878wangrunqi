from m mark singer subject re game length wa re brave update in article mzimmer michael zimmer write in article hhenderson write nflynn write i agree with nick what the big deal about long game if you want to watch baseball there that much more baseball to watch and ye baseball include the space between play a well a the play themself first a longer game in no way suggest more baseball to watch unles you include watch the gras grow a baseball the lengthier game be so because of batter step out of the box pitcher take longer between pitch and excessive trip to the mound by manager and pitch coach until six or seven year ago i wa an enthusiastic fan of nfl football last year i hardly watch a game what turn me off be the incessant interruption to the continuity of the game a team score minute of commercial kickoff minute of commercial three down and a punt minute of commercial aaaaarrrrgh earlier in thi thread i comment on larussa and the a whom i believe institutionalize slow play i do mind the cat-and-mouse game with rickey on first in fact i rather enjoy it similarly i would enjoy the battle with listach or lofton or polonium on first what i object to be when such game be play with karkovice on first or when the game be a blowout i do mind when the pitcher step off the mound to gather hi think in a crucial situation or when a hitter step out of the box to regain hi concentration what i object to be when hitter and pitcher take such break at every opportunity when a game be excite these little delay serve a tension builder and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game when the delay happen with regularity they become nuisance just like the commercial break in football i understand the nfl impose a number of rule change to speed up the game basically put an onu on the officiate staff to move the marker and the ball to the spot faster that do not addres the problem of the continuity of the game it may have appease the sponsor and the network but i would be amaze if it do anything to enhance the experience of the fan similary while some baseball game bore me to tear those be the one where there be no continuity and the player be take exasperatingly long period to get ready for each pitch i doubt if anyone watch the braves-giant game care about gant step out i doubt if anyone watch that game would have find that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claim by the drama that wa present i would be totally oppose to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball on the other hand i wish baseball have a commissioner that wa powerful enough to sit down with and explain that they be actually hurt the product of baseball by drag their game out the way that they do i sure would mind a little arm-twisting there the beastmaster mark singer m
