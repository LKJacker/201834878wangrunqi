from sam sam mandelbaum subject yankee thought ye everyone seem to be in agreement that the yankee be finally move in the right direction they should finish over thi year and maybe even be in the pennent race in august however i would take back a few move the jim abbott trade i think abbott be not only an inspirational person but a great pitcher also he could win the cy young thi year but he wo because the right side of the yank infield be good enough so why wa thi not a good trade jt snow how many rookie have be able to step in and immediately have the impact that he ha have so far on the angel i know it early but if you see thi kid hit field or talk you can just tell that he be go to be a tremendou player the yank should have keep him what about mattingly you ask well it great that the yank have take care of him and remain loyal but he year older than snow and just do have the same bat speed a before hi back injury it a shame but a a yankee fan who want to see the best yankee team i take snow over mattingly at first the yank also give up two promise propect with snow for abbott beside with domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello and sterling hitchcock they be just load with propect i know abbott only but thi wa too much to give up i believe george force thi trade because he believe and he right that abbott will be a big hit in ny however i like to see the yankee build a baseball team not an amusement show wade bogg i live in boston and like wade a lot but hi career be wind down and i would rather see the yank start to develop a long term solution hensley muelin rus davi velarde beside wade just do have any range what a shame about charlie haye huh spike owen see wade bogg i much rather see them develop dave silvestrus or whoever wade and spike next to each other in the infield be go to raise the yankee staff era point and these guy be on the down side of their career danny tartabull ye he put up some tremendou number and it nice to think about what he could do if he be ever healthy all year but he never be we should expect game max out of him meanwhile gerald william be play at columbu and paul be play leave field i believe lead nl outfielder in assist last year and tartabull be a poor defensive outfielder what i basically get at be the yank be move in the right direction but be not ready to win a pennent thi year they should at the gm level be plan for a or world series thi mean get the younger player experience in the major now so they will be ready in a year or two i afraid that all thi stuff wreak of george steinbrenner certainly the bogg deal wa all george it look like george be plan the right mix of veteran and young player to win a world series now the veteran be alway available and can be add at any time like boston do thi year develop the young player first then add the one or two veteran or in the yankee case just keep them let all u yankee fan hope that george do dismantle the terrific job stick and company have do build the yankee organization back into one of respect i really afraid that he will trade whoever it take to patch hole today relief pitch for example george must realize that the yankee rebuild proces be still one or two year away have patience george and we will all enjoy the future fire bucky and trade the kid and it baseball hell for all loyal yankee fan for a long time sam i not militello or millitello mandelbaum
