from snichol sherrus nichol subject re young catcher in article genetic david m tate write a for rush if there really be a qualitative difference between the minor and the major that require a period of adjustment and i do believe there be then would you rather waste lopez old good season than hi old very good season or hi excellent season the sooner you get him acclimate the more of hi prime you get to use can anybody name a player who wa to the major let for argument sake define rush a bring up to the major for more than a cup of coffee prior at age or younger and perform below expectation whose career wa damage by thi rush i seriou i tend to agree with david that bring the player up sooner be better but i like to look at player for whom thi theory do work if there be any i prefer player within the last year or so because then i can look up their minor league stat it important to distinguish between player who legitimately have career below what their minor league number would have project a oppose to player who be hype and fail but actually have career not out of line with their minor league number let kick it off with an example of a player who wa rush although there do seem to have be any damage to hi career jay bell wa give pa in the major league at age and perform well below what you would expect from hi aaa number the same season he get pa the next year at age and still underperform however the next year at age hi performance improve and he win the everyday shortstop job and ha be there ever since it really hard for me to see where he would have be better off stay in the minor league where he wa perform quite well in aaa during thi time rather than be rush cleveland might have be better off i suppose because they might have be le likely to give up on him ye if you bring a player up early he likely go to struggle but do that delay the time at which he stop struggle and start perform up to expectation sherrus nichol snichol
