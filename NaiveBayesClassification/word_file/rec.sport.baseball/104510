from hasch bruce anonymou hasch subject re dave kingman for the hall of fame in article steve tomassi write hi baseball fan so what do you say do you think he deserve it i mean heck if dave winfield ho-hum be seriously be consider for it a be lee smith ha then why do we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evan yeah yeah after the hall of fame take in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon oh yeah dave winfield marginal player guy do hit a lick have negligible power wa a crap fielder and have no stay power dave winfield now enter hi i believe big league season be still a damn decent hitter admittedly hi defense ha slip a great deal but in hi prime he have a powerful arm and great range take a look at the stat i do know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman be similar player kingman wa a one-dimension power hitter he could field he run like an anvil hit for a low average though if i remember right hi obp wa that hideou and for those who consider such thing important wa a absolute-primo-dick eddie murray yup only the best baseman of the i know that mvp vote be conduct by mediot but give that he get job out of the mvp he deserve in it seem that he wa overrate by the medium lee smith hmmmm thi one actually pretty close he have a s solid dependable career a a closer despite pitch in some nasty park wrigley fenway i have to take a closer look at the stat it be a while but it seem lee arthur be of hof caliber you do make a legitimate point about the hof credential of reliever simply rack up a lot of save do mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch too simply because minnesotum and boston and for a month atlantum use reardon a a closer for longer than he should have be one the equalizer ha rack up an impressive number of save no way should homerman be in the hof imho darrell evan nice career actually a bite underrate kinda like ted simmon imho but not a well in any case i be sick and tire mostly sick of everybody give hall of fame consideration to player that be by today standard marginal lem me ask you thi who the hell play the game is marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount do belong there they both shortstop that just hang around for a long time big deal let be a little more selective huh stop hand out these honor so liberally save them for the guy who really deserve it face it if something now wait a goddamn minute here ozzie smith absolutely redefined the position of shortstop hi defense wa so good that he win something along the line of gold glove again gold glove be mediot-biased and a good argument could be make that larkin deserve one or two of ozzie more recent award but usually thi be temper by someone else in the early get the gold glove ozzie deserve earlier in hi career ozzie offense you ask good obp great speed number in a park which for most of hi career depress offense admittedly no power against tom niedenfuer but still a definite asset offensively yount hit mvp at two different position uh-huh a real stiff hi wa one of the great year ever by a player in recent memory and probably rank behind only the peak season of wagner and bank a far a ss number go he a clear imho be do there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individual believe that steve garvey or jack morri be potential candidate the absurdity be apparent gee can these guy even compare to the more likely future hall of famer like kirby puckett or nolan ryan well a far a garvey go you right garvey be a mediot candidate push because of hi win attitude a minor factor if one at all and hi great defense no error admittedly but the range of a tree stump garvey should be in the hof skyjack i say a lot of nasty thing about skyjack in the last year or so but thi be mostly in response to mediot and woofer who talk about morri ability to win which be nothing more than morri ability to pitch when toronto to score ton of run at thi point morri be an average pitcher although from hi early return in he may be damn close to do but in all fairnes morri wa a dominant pitcher in the for up-and-down tiger team while wa obviously a great year for detroit the rest of the decade the team wa generally in contention but not favorite morri career number be quite good and worthy of hof consideration ryan of course but be careful i guarantee you that someone will throw back ymy earlier logic about yount and smith be shortstop who hang around a long time after all nolan never win a cy damn he just pitcher who hang around for year hi w-l record be mediocre of course nolan a puck probably although he get to play reasonably well for a few more year year even good one be enough to make the hof most likely that say i believe puckett will make the hof pretty much regardles of how the rest of hi career turn out bar something really tragic or sudden he very popular in the medium and with fan and legitimately ha be one of the best cf in the game since he join the league i alway like the guy and i hope he do make it and in the end i think the puck will make it in but really it too early to sell thi debate come up rather frequently on the net and believe it or not i never tire of it it an interest subject here an off the top of my head list of potential from each team i probably leave a couple of guy off so feel free to follow up i wo consider anyone who start play after about again too early to tell note these be all active player i not count recent retiree baltimore cal ripken should be a lock by now even if gehrig record stand boston roger clemen might be a lock already which be amaze dawson detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker possibility milwaukee robin yount discuss earlier new york wade bogg possibly mattingly long shoot toronto paul molitor and jack morri possibility kansa city george brett lock minnesotum kirby too early to tell winfield lock oakland eckersley lock mcgwire too early rickey lock welch long shoot texa the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange cub sandberg lock st loui ozzie lock lee smith probably new york murray almost a lock saberhagen obviously he get to regain past form and most certainly not vince coleman despite what he tell you lo angele butler strawberry and hershiser be all long shoot san diego tony gwynn pretty good shoot colorado dale murphy a good shoot ryan bowen just to see if you awake before i get flame thi be an off-the-top-of-the-head list there probably a few deserve candidate that i leave off and i do include barry bond will clark any atlantum starting pitcher frank thoma canseco mcgriff etc because i only consider guy who start play before e-mail or post i almost fear what i may have start here bruce hasch hasch sell the team eli if a hitter be a good fastball hitter do that mean i should throw him a bad fastball larry andersen
