from gspira greg spira subject re note on jay v indian series something else to consider alomar h-r split be slg obp baerga wa and pretty clearly alomar get a huge boost from hi home park not necessarily it could mean that or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he do on the road see frank thoma split in for an example i would gues that some of alomar split be due to the skydome but most of it be probably due just to coincidence there no way to be sure of course but the only hitter the skydome seem to regularly help a lot be right hand home run hitter and alomar be not a home run hitter i say you could make a good for them be about equal right now t p rat baerga higher actually only because of t p bogu field stat which rate alomar a the worst defensive second baseman in the league on a career basi i think t p field stat may mean something but on a seasonal basi it come up with ridiculou result like thi alomar may not be the god of field the medium say he be but he sure be the worst in baseball offensively t p rate alomar much higher last year regarding the a v b argument i just say they both very good player with different strength and a bright future greg
