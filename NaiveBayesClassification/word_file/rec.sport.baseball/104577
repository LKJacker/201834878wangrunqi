from m mark singer subject re jose canseco swing v in article gary built like villanueva huckabay write wa go over some video last night and you write an excellent report about it he bulk up too much period he need to lose about pound not gain more bulk hi bat speed ha absolutely vanished conservatively i say he lose of hi bat speed and that a huge amount of speed that open stance be killing him note that he act sort of like brian downing way open to start then close up a ball be release downing could do thi without significant head movement canseco ca also note that canseco do alway close hi stance the same way sometime hi hip be open sometime they fully close without a good start point it hard to make adjustment in ymy swing i understand from an unreliable source that canseco wa consider expendable by the a when he refuse to accept any coach about hi bat stance the a brain trust come to believe that hi back problem be exacerbate if not cause by have a wide open stance close it quickly and then swing with a lot of torque that a paraphrase of what i remember in any event canseco take the road that he and he alone would decide hi stance and the a begin to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose hi ability to hit for both average and power aside from salt away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that i never have to work again i restructure my entire swing apparently you sound like larussa second drop pound cut out the weight work the a also object about thi if canseco open stance and result bad habit be a result of hi back problem he be out of baseball in three year if not he could still hit hr again i just repeat something i hear but possibly the cause and effect be the reverse of that the beastmaster mark singer m
