from bohnert matthew bohnert subject re why be barry bond not bat consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league imho to have william a streaky hitter and not really a clutch hitter bat ahead of bond be simply an injustice to the giant and fan of the giant having bond bat behind william mean that matt will get more good pitch to hit thi be important since he struggle so much with break ball opposing pitcher do want to walk william to get to bond you definitely correct in that william absolutely ha to be sandwich in between clark and bond he must and i mean must get fastball to hit otherwise he become little more than sixto lezcano in disguise what i would suggest be perhap bat bond william and clark the reason be that i feel bond potential basestealing ability be waste when he stick behind two slow runner i think the chance of get extra steal basis with bond in the spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by have clark in the spot matt
