from jeff jeff goldsmith subject re juggling dodger in m mark singer write if thi be true note that i do think it be lasorda should be fire for at least two reason publicly humiliate hi player knuckle under to hi player wish there be a fine line between get player input and knuckle under to player demand a manager much like a military officer need to have hi her player complete obedience and respect during a game after the game it no big deal but when there be no time to do more than react player must trust the manager or the team often fall apart see boston red sox ff strawberry demeanor a represent by the medium often sound like demand i suspect that a comment like i enjoy hit fourth i use to it would get pretty brutally misinterpret by the medium if it come from strawberry rus porter quote strawberry a say i feel more comfortable hit cleanup and i think i perform best in that role paraphrased by my memory and bia that seem like a fairly non-petulant answer to what wa almost certainly a question like how do you feel about be move to the third spot in the order a more media-sensitive player might answer the manager know what he be do if he think that bat me third will help the team then i be all for it we ignore that answer a brown stuff so it seem a little bite of an overreaction to brand darryl response a petulant personally i think hi argument be nonsense and that it really do matter much in which order the player in the order be bat except for personal stat if i be darryl i probably answer that question the number fmy spot get a few more rbi opportunity and i get pay for rbi i think it be best for me to bat fourth but i be will to hit third if tommy think it will benefit the team or something like that it would be helpful at salary time my rbi be down because i wa hit third and make him sound like a team player since strawberry will not likely go through arbitration but use the free agent market for hi next contract maybe that argument be useles but it would help hi image with the medium without appear to be totally content-free remember the medium be of the belief that one best rbi man should hit fourth so the argument be sensible regardles of whether or not it be true jeff
