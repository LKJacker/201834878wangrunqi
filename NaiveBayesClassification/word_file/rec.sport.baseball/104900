from shippert tim shippert subject re infield fly rule jrogoff jay rogoff write one last infield fly question that ha alway puzzle me and ha yet be address i believe the rule also do not deal with thi situation however if the infield fly be not catch at what point can a runner legally leave hi base fear of be double off for advance too early the runner can leave hi base at any time if the ball be catch he get to tag up if it be catch he have to tag up at all so if he feel lucky ymy runner at second can sprint for glory a soon a the ball be pop up if it be catch he probably score a run if it be he probably head for aaa the only effect the infield fly ha be to make the batter out thereby remove the force on the runner on base all other rule apply a if you be stand second with first open and the ball be pop up tim shippert shippert if we be go to stick to thi damn quantum-jumping then i regret that i ever have anything to do with quantum theory e schrodinger
