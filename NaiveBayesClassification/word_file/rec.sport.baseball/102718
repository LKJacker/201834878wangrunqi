from kevin mundstock subject joe robbie stadium not for baseball did anyone notice the word not for baseball print on the picture of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa today any reason give for thi also i just notice something look at the nolan ryan timeline in the preview on rickey henderson become nolan strikeout on he pitch hi no-hitter against oakland i believe the last out in the game wa make by rickey henderson and on nolan pitch hi no-hitter on the same day a certain someone steal hi base which overshadow it it seem that nolan be have a lot of publicity at rickey expense imo rickey deserve it and it seem a most of the net agree with me from what i see on it lately they be both great player but imo nolan ha outclass rickey both in play and more importantly in attitude just my think kevin
