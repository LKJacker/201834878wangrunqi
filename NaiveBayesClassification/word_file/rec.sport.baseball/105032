from healey subject re hbp bb big-cat the original poster want to know how the big cat look i wa also at the saturday game in montreal apr that rocky win i have pay much attention to gallarraga since he leave the expo but hi stance seem to be much different he stand more erect and very open with hi leave foot point to base i wonder if thi be a recent change in stance for him andre have one glare weaknes a a hitter he could alway be fool by a curve ball low and away if thi be indeed a new stance for him maybe he be not be fool a easily a for hi patience denni martinez definitely do not have hi good stuff if he wa groove pitch to andre you can hardly fault him for drill them which he do do andre generally start hot or cold do it take until may for most pitcher to have confidence in that curve ball low and away roger healey
