from rickert john h rickert subject mile high run how many run will be score in denver i do know but some idea can be get by look at the run score in mile high stadium during the last few year of the tenure in the american association here the total run score per game in zephyr game all league game and the ratio i find the same ratio for hr year rpg lea ratio hrpg lea ratio it seem pretty clear that denver will have a large effect on run score i stick with my prediction from last year that it be one of the top in the nl thi year and a fairly large effect on homerun though apparently not a large a atlantum wrigley cincinnatus and san diego still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park john rickert rickert
