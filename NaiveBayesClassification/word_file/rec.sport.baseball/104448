from dougla fowler subject team wa re royal final run total in a previou article sweda sean sweda say i be say thi for quite some time but be absent from the net for a while i figure i stick my neck out a bite the royal will set the record for fewest run score by an al team since the inception of the dh rule any idea what thi be they will fall easily short of run that for damn sure i ca believe these medium fool pick them to win the division like my tom gage of the detroit news claim herk robinson be some kind of geniu for the he make would you say the same thing about the dodger in or true cone be probably a good a drysdale and they have no koufax but still these team be win with home run leader who have very bad total with lot of low-scoring game etc and they do use reliever wherea jeff montgomery be have a super season for them that be say i still pick them or so but i think a superb pitch team can win if they have enough hit there more of a chance of that i think than of a team with tremendou hit but no pitch at least to me i wonder though which one do you person think would do better a team with johnson koufax in hi prime seaver carlton and young in no real order a the starter with sutter finger and lyle in the bullpen but with a puny offense assume good defense like mazeroski maranville etc or a team with poor pitch but with an offense of cobb carew ruth gehrig may schmidt wagner and bench again you pick the order i would postulate that the pitch one would be several game better by season end even the best hitter can succeed only of the time in their best year but a great pitcher can throw lot of shutout take all the player in their prime they might throw shutout in a year and all the offense would have to do be get run acros i wonder if someone with stratomatic or something could plug such all time team into a regular season have it play and report the result i would love to see that doug fowler me age now mommy and daddy other ever wonder if after casey relative have to give lot of hug love miss the strike in the poem support heaven be just a great he run to first and make it big hug that last forever and ever
