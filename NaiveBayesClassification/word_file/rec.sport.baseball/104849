from choman charle stanley homan subject rbi question is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly rbi thi be the situation that bring the question up the red sox be up in the bottom of the by a score of the mariner have the basis load with out the batter hit a fly to center which the fielder catch the runner at third tag and score without a throw now without a judgement call and i do think there be one thi be an rbi for the batter it seem to me that a better name for thi would be defensive indifference since it do really matter whether the guy at third score at that point i know i can think of several if the mariner steal third and second which open the base would allow and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman get deep in the hole between himself and third he would have a play at home third or second for the out and maybe he therefore ca make the throw to first to get the last out etc scenario too but do it really matter if thi guy score thi way when you down by if the tie run be go to score so be the guy on third the point be that the batter imo should get credit an rbi for utterly fail to do hi job which at thi point be to get a hit or a walk not trade an out for one run what do you guy think regard burke charle s homan choman go red sox go rocket
