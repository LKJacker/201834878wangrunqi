from cmeyer craig meyer subject re jack morri michael chen mike write in any case i think viola would have make a better sign why viola be younger and be leave hand how many leave hand starter do toronto have well i agree that viola be a better sign however why do everyone say that you want lefthanded starter i understand lefthanded spot reliever even though they usually face more righthanded batter than lefthanded batter i just do understand why person insist on lefthanded starter unles there be a park effect yankee stadium most batter in mlb be righthanded so righthanded starter will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starter i gues one argument for lefty starter be that certain team may be more vulnerable to lhp than rhp however thi be probably only a factor in the postseason because team seldom juggle their starter for thi reason during the regular season i think you just want the best starter you can get regardles of whether they be lefty or righty lefthanded starter tend to have higher era than righthanded starter precisely because manager go out of their way to start inferior lefty or perhap because of the platoon advantage am i miss something here craig
