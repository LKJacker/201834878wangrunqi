from m mark singer subject re basis load walk gife red win in in article hbrook write in article m mark singer write i do pretend to understand statistical analysi well we agree on the last part cool and thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly name-calling of other one of the basic thing you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player performance on it in the future be for there to be a correlation from year to year a player bat average be correlate fairly well from year to year ok the basic problem with something like clutch bat average overall bat average be that the correlation from year to year be almost zero adding to the sample size do seem to help much actually i think the large-scale sample size be part of the problem it seem to me that if we be to plot all the player in baseball in regard to ba v clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve the x-axi be the deviation in clutch hit v non-clutch the y-axi be the number of player certainly there would be some player on the extreme end of the bell my supposition be that if we be to find the same player consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusion about those player a oppose to all baseball player a a counterexample to what you show consider the follow two player from non-clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba maldonado lemon if you have have these two player in by ymy logic in those clutch situation you bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye well in maldonado hit in non-clutch and in clutch while lemon hit in non-clutch and in clutch before you accuse me of completely cook the datum you wo hear those kind of accusation from me it be interest that you select maldonado because he be someone whom i have also look at he ha be a very inconsistent hitter in term of ba hit in admittedly he ha be trade between league a well a club hi clutch hit record be equally inconsistent so for my purpose in i would not draw any conclusion about hi ability to hit in the clutch base on hi prior performance i do know how i would have felt in but you may indeed be right when i look at sabo i find a more consistent record of hit and a more consistent pattern of hi clutch hit be proportionately below hi non-clutch ba ditto for joe carter thi probably bring u to the heart of the disagreement i be have with other on thi topic must any conclusion base on statistical history be able to be apply broadly throughout a datum base before it ha any validity is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysi to select component of the datum base btw correlate player overall bat average from with gife a correlation coefficient of which be significant at something better than the confidence level correlating their clutch-non-clutch ba for the same period gife a correlation of significant at no level of any interest i completely accept that reason again what if we be to find the same individual at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basi actually it technically incorrect to say that we ca predict future clutch performance it more correct to say that we ca predict future clutch performance with any skill aman the beastmaster mark singer m
