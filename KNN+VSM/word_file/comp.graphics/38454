from boebert earl boebert subject removing distortion from bitmapped drawing let say you have a scan image of a line draw in thi case a boat but it could be anything on the draw you have a set of reference point whose true x y position be know now you digitize the draw manually in thi case use yaron danon excellent digitize program that be you use a program which convert cursor position to x y and save those value when you click the mouse upon digitize you notice that the reference point value that come out of the digitize proces differ in small but significant way from the know true value thi be understandable because the scan draw be a reproduction of the original and there be successive source of distortion such a differential expansion and contraction of paper error introduce in the print proces scanner error and what have you the error be not uniform over the entire draw so global adjustment such a uniformly over x or y or rotate the whole draw be not satisfactory so the question be do any kind soul know of an algorithm for remove such distortion in particular if i have three set of point reference x y the know true value distortedreference x y the same point with know error distorteddatum x y other point with unknown error what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddatum to remove the error i suspect the problem could be solve by treat the distort reference point a result from the projection of a bumpy surface solve for the surface and then flatten it to remove the error in the other datum point any kind and inform soul out there have any idea or better yet pointer to treatment of the same or similar problem thank earl
