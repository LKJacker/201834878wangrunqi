from ttknock bos hogg subject pov animate in an attempt to do animation with pov i have create two little program one be a c program that will perform a morph between any two point give the amount of frame for the morph and then it will write the point and the function translate rotate etc out to a file then i have a perl script that will read the list of function and insert them into a pov file at a give line i have hop thi would let me do simple animation however i have discover that simply perform incremental rotation on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axi now i know an easy way around thi would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but i know there must be another way around thi i have think perhap it wa because i have create object at the origin and then translate them to a new point and then do the rotation which could cause thi behavior however thi occur on object that be not translate at all any help be appreciate ttknock
