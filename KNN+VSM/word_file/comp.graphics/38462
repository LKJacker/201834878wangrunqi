from sloan kenneth sloan subject re removing distortion from bitmapped drawing in article boebert earl boebert write let say you have a scan image of a line draw in thi case a boat but it could be anything on the draw you have a set of reference point whose true x y position be know now you digitize the draw manually in thi case use yaron danon excellent digitize program that be you use a program which convert cursor position to x y and save those value when you click the mouse upon digitize you notice that the reference point value that come out of the digitize proces differ in small but significant way from the know true value thi be understandable because the scan draw be a reproduction of the original and there be successive source of distortion such a differential expansion and contraction of paper error introduce in the print proces scanner error and what have you the error be not uniform over the entire draw so global adjustment such a uniformly over x or y or rotate the whole draw be not satisfactory so the question be do any kind soul know of an algorithm for remove such distortion in particular if i have three set of point reference x y the know true value distortedreference x y the same point with know error distorteddatum x y other point with unknown error what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddatum to remove the error i suspect the problem could be solve by treat the distort reference point a result from the projection of a bumpy surface solve for the surface and then flatten it to remove the error in the other datum point it help to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least a reasonable model of the clas of distortion below be a very short description of the proces which we use if you have further question feel free to poke me vium e-mail assume locally smooth distortion compute the delaunay triangulation of ymy x y point thi define the set of neighbor for each point if ymy datum be not naturally convex you may have very long edge on the convex hull consider delete these edge now there be two goal a move the distorteddatum x y to the reference x y b keep the length e a measure from the current x y a close a possible to the digitizedlength e a measure use the digitize x y for every point compute a displacement base on a and b for example a for x y point for which you know the reference x y you can move reference x y current x y thi will slowly move the distortedreference x y toward the reference x y b for all other point examine the current length of each edge for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length where correct be the digitizedlength take the vector sum of these edge displacement and move the point thi will keep the triangulate mesh consistent with ymy digitized mesh iterate until you be happy for example no point move very much and need to be determine by experimentation consider how much you believe the reference x y do you absolutely insist on the final point exactly match the reference or do you want to balance some error in match the reference against change in length of the edge warning there be a couple of geometric invariant which must be observe essentially you ca allow the convex hull to change and you ca allow triangle to fold over neighbor triangle both of these can be handle either by special case check on the motion of individual point or by periodically re-triangulating the point use the current position but still calculate digitizedlength from the original position when we first do thi the triangulation time wa prohibitive so we only do it once if i be motivate to try and change code that ha be work in production mode for year i might go back and re-triangulate on every iteration if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider have every point interact with every other point but first read up on linear solution to the n-body problem there be lot of paper in the last year of siggraph proceed on spring constraint and energy calculation which be relevant the above method be describe in more or le detail in inproceeding author sloan jr kenneth r and david meyer and christine title reconstruction and display of the retina booktitle proceedings graphic interface vision interface addres vancouver canada page month may techreport author christine and kenneth and david meyer title computer method for sampling reconstruction display and analysi of retinal whole mount number tr institution department of computer science university of washington addres seattle wa month december article author christine and kenneth and david meyer title computer method for sampling reconstruction display and analysi of retinal whole mount journal vision research page kenneth sloan computer and information science sloan university of alabama at birmingham campbell hall uab station fax birmingham al
