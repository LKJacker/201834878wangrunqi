from rw ronald w schmidt subject outline of spline surface about a year ago i start work on a problem that appear to be very simple and turn out to be quite difficult i be wonder if anyone on the net ha see thi problem and hopefully some publish solution to it the problem be to draw an outline of a surface define by two roughly parallel cubic spline for input the problem essentially start with two set of point where each set of point be on the edge of an object which we treat a two dimensional only extant between the edge but which exist in three dimensional space to draw the object we fit a cubic spline through the point each spline be effectively compute a a sequence of line segment approximate the curve each spline ha an equal number of segment we assume that the nth segment along each spline be roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the oppose spline use the pair of segment to form two triangle which will be fill in to color the surface depth sort the triangle take each triangle in sort order project onto a pixmap draw and color the triangle take the edge of the triangle that be along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge color with a special edge color it be the edge color in step that be at the heart of the problem the idea be to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally ha lot of break and gap in the edge of the surface the reason for thi be fairly complicate they involve both rasterization problem and problem result from the project the spline if anything about thi problem sound familiar we would appreciate know about other work in thi area thank
