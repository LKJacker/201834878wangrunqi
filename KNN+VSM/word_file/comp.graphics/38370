from orourke joseph subject re need a good concave convex polygon algorithm in article richard stoakley write we need a good concave convex polygon conversion routine i try a couple without much luck please e-mail response and i will post a summary of any reply thank you richard stoakley the problem be not precisely define above but if you need to find the smallest convex polygon that enclose a give polygon then you be seek the convex hull of ymy original polygon there be two way to do thi use a somewhat tricky but by-now well examine linear-time algorithm that exploit the polygon boundary or just fee the vertex of the original polygon to a convex hull routine and accept o n log n both method be discuss in preparatum and shamo for example
