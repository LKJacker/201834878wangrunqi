from bolson edward bolson subject re sphere from point i plan to post a summary of response to thi a soon a i have work code which i will also include the intersection of plane method look best but my implementation base on a short article in graphic gem i do work i may be misinterpret of course i have avoid the simultaneou solution of the plane equation in favor of dot and cro product but the former may actually be better in either case a matrix determinant need to be compute implicitly in the solution of linear equation to get the plane i wa take the midpoint of the line from say to and set the normal a the normalize vector from to these just plug into the formula in graphic gem however the result center point be only occasionally equidistant from all of my test point for different test my math be very rusty but it look like i need to verify the formula or use the simultaneou equation solution which will require bring in another routine i do have but should be easy to find another method be to first find the center of the circle define by set of point and intersect the normal from there thi would also define the circle center however small numerical imprecision would make the line not intersect supposedly plane have to intersect in a unique point if they be not parallel ed thank to all who answer so far ed bolson university of washington cardiovascular research bolson prefer bolson bolson if you must
