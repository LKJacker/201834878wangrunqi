from pinky the man behind the curtain subject view on isomorphic perspective i work upon a game use an isometric perspective similar to that use in populou basically you look into a room that look similar to the follow xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the good thing about thi perspective be that you can look and move around in three dimension and still maintain ymy peripheral vision since ymy viewpoint be alway the same the routine can be hard-coded for a particular vantage in my case wall two rise edge ha a slope of i also use mode x i run into two problem i sure that other reader have try thi before and have perhap formulate their own opinion the routine for draw wall be trivial but when i run a pack planar image through them i wa dismay by the jaggy i now consider some anti-aliasing routine speed be not really necessary is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skew thu be assure of nice image or be thi too much of a burden wall present a problem the algorithm i use tend to overly distort the original i try to decide on paper what pixel go where and fail ha anyone come up with method for map a planar to crosswise shear shape currently i take and produce line follow the slope line be directly under line line move up a line and leave pixel line be under line thi fill the shape exactly without any unfilled pixel but it cause distortion ha anyone come up with a better way perhap it be necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skew are there any other particularly sticky problem with thi perspective i wa plan on have hide plane removal by use z-buffering location be store in x y z form for those of you who notice the top line of wall and wall be parallel with it bottom line thi be why there appear to be an optical illusion ie it appear to be either the inside or outside of a cube depend on ymy mood there be no vanish point thi simplify the draw code for object which do have to change size a they move about in the room i decide that thi approximation be alright since small displacement at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective draw hopefully the context of the picture ie chair on the floor torch hang on the wall will dispell any visual ambiguity thank in advance for any help till next time o o v o v email pinky sam inala v
