from jih-shin ho subject i have post to you may distribute thi program freely for non-commercial use if no fee be gain there be no warranty the author be not responsible for any damage cause by thi program important change since version fix bug in file management system file display improve file management system more user-friendly fix bug in xpm version read fix bug in targa fix bug in read add support for pcx and write auto-skip macbinary header introduction thi program can let you read write and display image with different format it also let you do some special effect rotation dithering on image it main purpose be to let you convert image among different formt include simple file management system support show there be no limit on image size currently thi program support bite display if you want to use hicolor or truecolor you must have vesa driver if you want to modify video driver please read section hardware requirement pc or better msdo or higher min amount of ram be byte maybe le memory will also work i recommend min byte for better performance hard disk for swap virtual memory the follow description be borrow from djgpp supported ware up to of extend memory expand under vcpus up to of disk space use for swap supervga mode up to xm vdisk memory allocation strategy vcpus program such a qemm desqview and unsupported dpmi microsoft window feature emulator unix-ish environment flat memory model svga graphic installation video driver and be borrow from djgpp if you use western digital vga chip read thi be a modify version for vesa and be completely compatible with original version but some person report that thi be not compatible with other djgpp program in their system if you encounter thi problem do put within search path please read for how to run thi program if you choose a video driver add to environment for example x nc if you do have add x to environment for example x emu x note i only test and other driver be not test i have modify to support bite display you do need to use vesa driver if do work please try for those who want to use hicolor or truecolor display please use except user you can find vesa bio driver from command line switch usage display d display s sort h display type svga default hicolor truecolor sort method function key change disk drive ctrl-a ctrl-z change disk drive change filename mask see change parameter some

allow for that format detail initialization set default display type to highest display type find allowable screen resolution for grn video driver only when you run thi program you will enter menu whthin thi menu you can pres any function key except if you move or copy file you will enter menu the menu be much like menu but only allow you to change directory the header line in menu include d xx f xx t xx d display type f number of file t number of tag file press space in menu will let you select which format to use for read current file press return in menu will let you read current file thi program will automatically determine which format thi file be the procedure be first check magic number if fail check standard extension still fail report error press s or s in menu will do show if delay time be program will wait until you hit a key except escape if any error occur program will make a beep escape to terminate press in in menu will change display type press alt-x in menu will quit program without prompt once image file be successfully read you will enter menu within thi menu be turn on you can do special effect on image press return show image in graphic mode pres return space or escape to return to text mode press tab change process target thi program allow you to do special effect on or image press left right arrow change display type bite press space save current image to file dither save a image bite grey scale save a grey image bite full color save a color image bite true color save a image thi program will ask you some question if you want to write image to file some question be format-dependent finally thi program will prompt you a filename if you want to save file under another directory other than current directory please pres space after press space you will enter menu you can change directory to what you want then press space thi program will prompt you filename press return thi program will prompt you filename filename under bar thi program support bite display thi program be memory greedy if you do have enough memory the performance be poor if you want to save bite image try gif then tiff lzw then targa then sun raster then bmp then if you want to save bite image lossles try tiff lzw or targa or ilbm or sun raster no one be better for true image i recommend jpeg for store bite image even bite image not all subroutine be fully test thi document be not well write if you have any problem suggestion comment about thi program please send to i need ymy suggestion to improve thi program there be no anonymou ftp on thi site tech information program user interface and some subroutine write by jih-shin ho some subroutine be borrow from xv and pbmplu dec tiff and jpeg be through public domain library compiled with djgpp you can get whole djgpp package from or mirror site for example for thoese who want to modify video driver get grx source code from or mirror site for hicolor and truecolor bite of color be set to bite of color be set to bite of color be set to acknowledgment i would like to thank the author of xv and pbmplu for their permission to let me use their subroutine also i will thank the author who write tiff and jpeg library thank dj without djgpp i ca do any thing on pc jih-shin ho
