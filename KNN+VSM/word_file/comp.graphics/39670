from jesup randell jesup subject re product to handle hdtv move pircture kazsato write i like to know if there be any system cpu hd array framebuffer which can play and record hdtv quality move picture in realtime hdtv ha about so move picture will need about bandwidth i think to treat the raw datum not compress actually for digital hdtv system that far higher bandwidth than you need unles there some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed hdtv also my calculation be that each frame should be well under even use which be more bite than you actually need or should be enough for a move picture be i guess at hdtv resolution it may be a bite wider than i fairly sure of the number for most of the digital proposal i hope you have a very fast memory system a well while display will require a heavily interleave vram system unles you have a very compel reason i advise try to use at least somewhat compress datum you do have to go to full compression to get to a level where the datum io requirement be much cheaper and easier to deal with gnu emac be a lisp operate system disguise a a word processor doug mohney in randell jesup jack-of-quite-a-few-trades commodore engineering jesup or rutger cbmvax jesup bix rjesup disclaimer nothing i say be anything other than my personal opinion
