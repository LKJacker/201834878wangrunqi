from val val kartchner subject re where do the hacker ethic go vincus filipe write in article bobp bob pendleton write from article by mwmeyer mike wad through the muck and meyer in article bobp bob pendleton write thi be get pretty silly first off hacker be an obsolete term do matter what it use to mean today it mean thief it only mean thief if you want it to mean that to me it mean lot of context wickedly omit by myself anyway if i say joe be a hacker to most english speak person who know the word they probably think he be either a poor golfer or a bad carpenter but there be very very few person who will think he be a good and clever programmer if you choose to call yourself by a term that mean thief do be surprise when person think you be a thief even if you do agree with that definition of the word the narrower view that a hacker when associate with the compute environment be a dishonest expert be not so widespread i my opinion at least with the person involve with the field imho the wider mean be not obsolete at all no matter how much the lay pres would like it to be therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody perceife you a a thief then thi person belong to a very very small group that ha some computer knowledge but not enough to know the wider and original mean of the word unfortunately the general public ha a very narrow view of the deep dark recess of the art of compute what little they do see be from the view give to them by the medium from what i have see from the medium be not a proper way by which to refer to a respect person i on the other hand know what mean from those who consider themself such following be the definition from jargon file thi be also know a the hacker dictionary the definition be arrange in order of decrease frequency of usage hacker originally someone who make furniture with an axe n a person who enjoy explore the detail of programmable system and how to stretch their capability a oppose to most user who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary one who program enthusiastically even obsessively or who enjoy program rather than just theorize about program a person capable of appreciate hack value a person who be good at program quickly an expert at a particular program or one who frequently do work use it or on it a in unix hacker definition through be correlate and person who fit them congregate an expert or enthusiast of any kind one might be an astronomy hacker for example one who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcome or circumvent limitation deprecate a maliciou meddler who try to discover sensitive information by poke around hence hacker hacker see cracker the term also tend to connote membership in the global community define by the net see network the and internet addres it also imply that the person describe be see to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic see hacker ethic the it be better to be describe a a hacker by other than to describe oneself that way hacker consider themself something of an elite a meritocracy base on ability though one to which new member be gladly welcome there be thu a certain ego satisfaction to be have in identify yourself a a hacker but if you claim to be one and be not you quickly be label bogu see also wannabee hacker ethic the n the belief that information-sharing be a powerful positive good and that it be an ethical duty of hacker to share their expertise by write free software and facilitate acces to information and to compute resource wherever possible the belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration be ethically ok a long a the cracker commit no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality both of these normative ethical principle be widely but by no mean universally accept among hacker most hacker subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense and many act on it by write and give away free software a few go further and assert that all information should be free and any proprietary control of it be bad thi be the philosophy behind the gnu project sense be more controversial some person consider the act of crack itself to be unethical like break and enter but thi principle at least moderate the behavior of person who see themself a benign cracker see also samurai on thi view it be one of the highest form of hackerly courtesy to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop preferably by email from a superuser account exactly how it wa do and how the hole can be plug act a an unpaid an unsolicited tiger team the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic be that almost all hacker be actively will to share technical trick software and where possible compute resource with other hacker huge cooperative network such a usenet fidonet and internet see internet addres can function without central control because of thi trait they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom most valuable intangible asset finally a true hacker do not name one for thi be a title that be bestow by the befuddle sysadmin and user at large to me a sign of a truly great hacker be to be introduce to someone who say nahh i just know a thing or two person alway exagerate note that the above definition do not preclude a hacker from describe limself mean one but simply say that it be better not to do so there be many who do not know the mean of so in order to defend the true mean of the word it be sometime necessary to borrow on the reputation of a know respect hacker around the workplace thi mean that be define in term of some well-known and respect person sometime there may only be one such person no matter what mr dumpty say language do work that way actually it do you just have to get adequate pres coverage language work anyway that we want it to work the purpose of language be to communicate to oversimplify a long a communication be take place then language be work include amiga
