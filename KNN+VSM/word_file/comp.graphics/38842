from hollasch steve hollasch subject re raytracing colour asecchium adrian secchium write when an incident ray i strike an object at point p the reflect ray r and the transmit ray t be calculate from the formula calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colour along the ray r and t a rcol and tcol each object ha it own colmy ocol and each light source ha licol i n the question be how do you combine rcol tcol ocol and all the licol to get the correct result colmy to return along the i ray first of all thi be not a snide response if you confuse about thi issue you will stumble over a lot of other thing a well i suggest that the weaknes be ymy reference material get an introduction to ray tracing by andrew glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm you could also refer to the edition of foley van dam on to the question the simple answer be that you just keep add up all the contribution and then clamp at the maximum intensity for example if ymy intensity value range from to then keep add up and clamp the resultant value to you might have to clamp the lower bind to if you have dark bulb but that another issue so you get some illumination equation like thi i lambient ldiffuse light n lreflected ltransparent the contribution due to reflection be just sum with the light intensity a be the light due to transparency now a slightly le hand-waving illumination equation be thi i kala kdld light n krlr ktlt that be each component of the illumination equation be govern by the material constant ka kd kr and kt so the maximum you can get from transparency for a give object for example might be for a purple-colored glas object hopefully thi answer ymy question i forward my illumination equation sermon to you also steve hollasch kubotum pacific computer inc hollasch santum clara californium
