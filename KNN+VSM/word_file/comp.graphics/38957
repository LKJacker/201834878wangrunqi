from lilley chri lilley subject re colmy transform for colmy blindnes in article geoffw geoffrey warren hick write posted on behalf of craig southeren who do not have acces to a net account can anyone provide me with a colmy space transform that would emulate the effect of colmy blindnes i have have a quick look in the computer graphic literature with no result perhap someone who ha acces to medical information could help certainly reference follow bear in mind that there be at least two condition which may be call colmy blind one protanopium be cause by a lack or major dysfunction of the l cone those that respond best to long wavelength thi gife much reduce and discrimination and also mean that red look dimmer than than they do to person with normal vision the other deuteranopium be due to miss or dysfunctional m cone although it can also be cause by a lack of the l-m cone difference signal in the retina it also gife reduce discrimination but be unaffected unlike protanopium red be not dimmer than normal on a uniform chromaticity diagram the horseshoe shape one you see in computer graphic book there be a single confusion point for each type of colmy deficiency colour which be confuse lie on straight line radiate from thi point for protanopium the point be at very close to the far red corner for deuteranopium the point be at note that different experimental investigation in the literature give slightly different value for these depend on the precise detail of the experimental setup random error and so on the value quote be typical so if all colour on a line be see a the same which colmy be actually see thi problem ha now be solve test on person with one normal eye and one affect eye have show that there be an axi for each type of disorder onto which all the colour collapse for protanope thi join up and on the spectral locu the edge of the horseshoe for deuteranope the line be very similar join and so to convert colour from normal vision to a simulate protanopium or duuteranopium plot the colmy on a uniform chromaticity diagram construct a line from thi point to the appropriate confusion point find the intersection of thi line with the appropriate axi line thi be the new chromaticity the best reference for thi be meyer greenberg defective vision and computer graphic display ieee computer graphic and application you will also need a decent reference on basic colmy science if you be not familiar with the cie xyz colmy model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram i would like to write a program probably a ppm filter to allow preview of image to check for sufficient contract for colmy blind user not be colmy blind myself thi be a bite difficult ye thi be certainly possible you will need the chromaticity of the red green and blue phosphor of the monitor you intend to display the image on and the chromaticity of the white point thi information can be measure or obtain from the manufacturer i post a list of some monitor chromaticity a couple of week ago the procedure for each pixel be a follow some lookup table might be a help here a convert rgb to cie xyz thi be a simple matrix multiplication once you have the monitor datum b retain the y component for later convert xyz to chromaticity coordinate use u v c find the equation of the line a in step above d find the intersection a in step e convert back from to xyz use the y value from step a f ensure that thi new colmy can be display on ymy monitor if not move it along a line in xyz space toward neutral grey ie half way between black and white until it be displayable please email reply i will summarise and repost if there be sufficient interest done also post for the rest of u chri lilley technical author ittus computer graphic and visualisation training project computer graphic unit manchester computing centre oxford road manchester uk internet voice fax janet
