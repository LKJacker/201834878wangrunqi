from lansd robert lansdale subject advice seek turning font outline into renderable polygon i be seek some alternate solution on how to turn a postscript type or truetype font outline into polygon that can be subsequently scan convert by a scanline renderer i have be study the problem of font conversion for a few year but have never have the need to implement such a system well i now have the opportunity to write some font render software so i would like to have some of my question answer before i jump into the deep end the main problem i face be how to use the or non-winding rule to turn the outline into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygon so there be no need to reduce the polygon to simple polygon for example in the letter o there be two outline the outside outline which be clockwise truetype font the inside outline which be counterclockwise one common solution use by a number of render package be to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outline be closest thi be equivalent to descibing a polygon with hole the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edge be in the opposite direction to the outside edge i do not want to use thi simplistic system since it will not handle all outline font properly it be not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy font it do not properly handle the or non-winding rule from my research over the year the proper solution be to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outline into trapezoid a be do by the postscript and truetype font rasterizer these trapezoidal polygon can then be easily and properly render by the scanline renderer my question be be there any better solution to turn the outline into polgyon other than the trapezoid decomposer i be not fond of thi solution since it create exces number of polygon another question for those in the know what be the best algorithm to create bevel offset curf for font outline i have a dozen paper on these subject but i ca tell which method be the best to implement thank for any pointer rob lansdale robert lansdale dynamic graphic project internet lansd computer system research institute uucp uunet lansd university of toronto bitnet lansd toronto ontario canada
