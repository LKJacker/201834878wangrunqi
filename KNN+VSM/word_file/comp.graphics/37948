from sloan kenneth sloan subject re surface normal orientation in article aqe srp stephen pietrowicz write how do you go about orient all normal in the same direction give a set of point edge and face look for edge inconsistency consider two vertex p and q which be connect by at least one edge if p q be an edge then q p should not appear if both p q and q p appear a edge then the surface flip when you travel acros that edge thi be bad assuming warn warn warn that you have an otherwise acceptable surface you can pick an edge any edge and traverse the surface enforce consistency with that edge pick an edge p q and mark it a ok for each face f contain thi edge if more than oop make sure that all edge in f be consistent the face should be p q q r r s s t t p flip those which be wrong mark all of the edge in f a ok and add them to a queue check for duplicate and especially inconsistency do let the queue have both p q and q p remove an edge from the queue and go to if a mark edge be discover to be inconsistent then you lose if step find more than one face share a particular edge then you lose otherwise when do all of the edge will be consistent which mean that all of the surface normal will either point in or out deciding which way be out be leave a an exercise kenneth sloan computer and information science sloan university of alabama at birmingham campbell hall uab station fax birmingham al
