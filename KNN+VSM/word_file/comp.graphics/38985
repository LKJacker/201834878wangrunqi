subject re tiff complexity from johnl john r levine in article you write anyone who think that tiff be too complex ha deal with cgm cda dca sgml or any one of a number of other very successful file format person seem perfectly capable deal with these other well yeah but unlike tiff they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmap and the other be hardly trouble free i hear that it be quite common for cgm implementation not to interoperate the annoy thing about tiff be that be that along with the useful option there be stupid option the most egregiou example be that rather than pick a byte order and bite order and use it consistently in all tiff file byte and bite order be option and all tiff reader on all machine no matter what their natural byte order have to be prepare to do byte swap there be fmy slightly different fax format again any one of them would have be adequate rgb image can be store by pixel or by component complexity without function etc etc i also note that the tiff doc say that aldu experiment show that lzw reliably compress a well or better than any of the fax format suggest that none of the fax format be really useful what worse a lot of the format be even implement very well lzw limit code word to bite while or bite would have provide substantially better compression and the lzw method compress byte rather than pixel but the absolute worst thing about tiff be that any vendor can register proprietary tiff code and format without even publicly document them thi mean that there be no way to write a tiff reader that can reliably read all incoming tiff file some standard regard john levine johnl iecc johnl
