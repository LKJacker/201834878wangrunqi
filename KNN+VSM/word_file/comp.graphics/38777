from alan alan christiansen subject re fast polygon routine need osprey luca adamski write in article idr ian d romanick write what kind of polygon shaded texturemapped hm more come into play with fast routine than just polygon it would be nice to know exaclty what system vga be a start but what processor and a few of the specific of the implementation you need to give more info if you want to get any answer p i do want texture map cause if i do i ask for them just a simple and fast routine to do fill polygon a for the processor it be for a minimum of a maybe if i ca find a good one for ideally i want a polyn function that can clip to a user-defined viewport and write to an arbitrary location in memory of course the chance of ok it be for a game that be and you have list the characteristic that you be look for i think you may have leave out a few important parameter the polygon be all convex they have le than n side you be draw mesh wall door etc i believe that the algorithm you can get that will only draw convex polygon can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave self intersect polygon thi efficiency can largely be attribute to the fact that simple convex polygon only have a leave and a right edge on each scan line complex figure type polygon can be a bite trickier the le than n side specification especially if it be a very small number like or allow othe optimisation to be make thu for a high speed game application i think you be look for code that exploit and be hence limit to draw simple convex polygon find something like that be pretty remote so i gues i need the source with it oh and i gues it would need to be in asm otherwise it be too slow i see some polygon routine in c and they all be waaay too slow it for a vector graphic program i be hunt high and low it may have be that they be very general purpose algorithm if you limit yourself to or fmy side simple convex polygon i think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be for a polyn function in asm and i ca find one anywhere that i can use i find one or two polyn function but my asm be pretty bad so i wo even try to rewrite them luca
