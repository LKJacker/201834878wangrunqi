from graeme graeme gill subject re look for circle algorithm faster than bresenham in article mpdillon michael dillon write i have an algorithm similar to bresenham line draw algorithm that draw a line by step along the minor axi and draw slice like aaaa bbbb cccc in the follow diagram aaaa bbbb cccc ye that know a bresenham run length slouse algorithm for incremental line see fundamental algorithm for computer graphic springer-verlag berlin heidelberg i have try to extrapolate thi to circle but i ca figure out how to determine the length of the slice any idea hmm i do think i can help you with thi but you might take a look at the follow double-step incremental generation of line and circle x wu and j g rokne computer graphic and image process vol no mar pp double-step generation of ellipse x wu and j g rokne ieee computer graphic application may pp graeme gill
