from squeegee stephen c gilardi subject need postscript strokeadjust info i need information on the display postscript strokeadjust feature thi feature adjust the endpoint of line so that the display line look better on low resolution device the postscript literature explain the proces to some extent they also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in postscript environment where it be absent the suggest emulation be to modify the coordinate of the endpoint of a line use the follow formula for each coordinate round doing thi we end up with all coordinate end in from read i think that what they might actually do be trunc thi result in all the coordinate end in either or whichever be closer by do some actual comparison with display postscript i find that neither of these be what dp really use since i like how the dp result look better than how my stuff look i like to know if anyone who know how dp do it be to tell me thank steve squeegee
