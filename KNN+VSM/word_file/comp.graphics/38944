from liones subject kubotum v e s freedome more person have be ask for information on the kubotum graphic workstation so here be some more info on the v the e s freedom here be the text of a denali v e s freedom do by brown associate denali bear a strong resemblance to evan and sutherland freedom graphic subsystem in several aspect of it high-level design both product use a parallel array of processor for geometric computation both have a pixel router to connect thi front end to a second array of pixel processor a a result denali and freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality both design team also appear to have similar philosophy with respect to modularity scalability and market penetration there remain however several important difference between the kpc and e s product evan and sutherland design freedom a a high-end developer dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility in it favor freedom ha configuration from two to sixteen float point unit a border range that start and end at a higher price and performance level than denali all freedom system include a large fix number of pixel processor that support a broader variety of color blend function the freedom design treat it entire image memory a general-purpose memory allow developer to allocate it on a flexible basi to a number of special-purpose application finally e s provide freedom with very flexible otput and video integration feature for multimedium and simulation application note that kpc be work an auxiliary board for ntsc and pal output that will not require an external video encoder e s programmable output feature however will remain much more flexible the kpc design team in contrast make denali more of an end-user system entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end freedom configuration and come in at more realistic mainstream price point denali do not need a many module a freedome because it use a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one result in better characteristic although both product provide strong support for image and volume render kpc recognize that not all user will want an even mix of these capability denali configuration flexibility allow customer in effect to purchase geometric and pixel process capability separately and to upgrade them separately a need both company have implement hardware texture map at workstation price level a a way to attack sgi more expensive vgxt and realityengine system the only other product to provide thi capability kpc support point sample and bilinear interpolation of texture in hardware but provide only software support for the higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolate mipmapping method on balance however denali provide bettern overall texturing capability than e s for most application aside from be much more affordable kpc solution deliver more parallelism for texture process and more off-screen memory for general graphic datum storage by implement texture map on it transformation module e s foce customer to move very quickly to higher price level to obtain better texturing performance kubotum avoid thi problem by link texturing to it frame buffer module provide a lower-cost more scalable solution hope thi help brian ps thi wa reprint without permission for the full text please contact kubotum
