from q van rijt subject re sphere from point there be another useful method base on least sqyare estimation of the sphere equation parameter the point x y z on a spherical surface with radiu r and center a b c can be write a x-a y-b z-c thi equation can be rewrite into the follow form approximate the leave hand part by f x y z for all datapoint determine the parameter which minimise the average error f x y z in recipe in c can be find algorithm to solve these parameter the best fit sphere will have center a b c radiu r sqrt so at last will thi solve you sphere estination problem at least for the most situation i think quick van rijt
