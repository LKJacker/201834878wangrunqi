from stein arthur stein subject scientific visualization of chemical system molecule ha evolve from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry computer graphic ha play a decisive role in thi transformation by allow chemist to build visualize and interact with complex geometrical object while computer scientist be conversant in the language of their own discipline they be often unfamiliar with the terminology simulation technique and practical need of research chemist similarly chemist be often unfamiliar with the latest paradigm and technological advance in graphical compute thi interdisciplinary course be intend to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researcher who wish to be more than just casual user of prepackaged graphic software although thi be not intend to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design datum set from chemical research problem will be use in lab and student will be encourage to bring datum set of their own lab exercise and project will be carry out use data-flow program ibm visualization datum explorer software and student will have acces to cornell theory center compute resource include video record equipment audience researcher and student in the chemical and biological science interest in integrate state-of-the-art computer graphic into their research computer scientist wish to gain familiarity with a major application of scientific visualization the clas size will be limit to participant on a first-come first-served basi level undergraduate or credit may be take without credit a a workshop calculu linear algebra and introductory chemistry require familiarity with unix x-window and c be useful but not require date june credit june or credit time mon-frus be to pm and pm to pm cost or credit credit format the course will be hold in the theory center train facility where computer workstation will be available daily lecture will be intersperse with laboratory exercise and ample time will be provide for project enablement and familiarization with the new compute environment student enrol for one credit will be grade on the basi of their laboratory exercise and short final project those enrol for a second credit will receive more advance lecture be give more time for project development and meet daily to share experience and discus problem encounter content may vary element of computer graphic polygonal render light model ray trace volumetric render stereo graphic animation introduction to data-flow program dx interactivity representing the atom size time and energy scale basic classical and quantum mechanic important category of molecule small molecule biopolymer surface and catalyst miscellaneou current application datum format and conversion advanced molecular graphic technique type of simulation and experiment electronic structure molecular electrostatic x-ray crystallography nmr quantum dynamic and spectroscopy instructor the course will be teach by two instructor topic relate to computer graphic will be handle by dr bruce land project leader of visualization cornell national supercomputing facility chemistry-specific aspect of the course will be handle by dr richard e gillilan visualization specialist and research scientist cornell national supercomputing facility to register mail complete form to cornell university school of continuing education and summer session day hall ithaca ny question richard gillilan richard important acceptance will be first-come first-served and base on a target clas size of full-credit and single or non-credit participant deadline may application form scientific visualization of chemical system chemistry computer science social security number if available cornell id number if available name last first middle suffix jr etc addres home addres where grade will be mail local phone home phone academic discipline course number check one chemistry computer science credit statu undergraduate student smart node consultant graduate student smart node advisor post-doctoral faculty other explain corporate commercial research staff other explain name of firm indicate which of the follow best describe you optional african american alaskan native asian american caucasian hispanic american native american list special need mobility impair accommodation block of room be available at the sheraton reservation must be make no later than may be sure to tell them you be here for the cornell theory center visualization workshop sheraton inn one sheraton drive ithaca fax rate start at other local motel make ymy reservation early my workshop coincide with other cornell event econo lodge cayuga mall n triphammer rd ithaca fax rate from ask for the cornell rate dorm room have also be reserve participant both credit and non-credit participant who be interest in dorm room should call below for registration information jeanne miller or donna smith email jeanne or donna
