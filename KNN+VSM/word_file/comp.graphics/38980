from kouhium juhana subject re xv problem in article write in article avt kouhium juhana write i write something about make color modification quickly with quantize image and only at the save the image to file proces we have to make the modification to the image thi make sense because the main use of xv be only view image doing many change to image we should keep all modification in a buffer and then before make the operation to image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operation think about what you be say here the bite image be quantise down to bite so many colour be map onto a single palette colmy thi colmy get modify in fairly arbitrary way you then want to apply these modification back to the bite file so you have to find which colour map to thi one palette colmy i suppose you do know what about we have discuss we discuss about error s in xv which show image only a and my suggestion above work perfectly with it so far i have see a colormap edit window in xv that be there must be a colormap anyway the problem you present be exist anyway and i do try to solve them at all because i would not make such problem to my program in the first place gamma and color correction be easily do to image a i present there no need make trick from image back to bite image how would you suggest do colmy edit on a bite file how would you group colour to edit them together only global change could be do unles the software be very different and much more complicate ok you write about situation that user want edit image a and user want edit individual color ymy question by the way jump off the discussion a bite my solution do work because there no colormap withing real image you see user see image go back to be silly about change individual color in image change individual color in colormap be useles in most case if the image be quantize and rasterize small change may make seriou error to anywhere in the image xv allow thi feature but i do recommend to use it with the mention type image moreover xv be not a paint program you can only make those global change in full xv change individual color sound like paint program job if person have screen there need for trick to get the original image modify because user do see full image there need to make approximation and it be not possible to modify individual color but individual pixel or pixel group if image be rasterize to select indiavidual color there could be cursor window which show true color image in cursor window area select individual color be possible from that ok i do have think very much paint program never see such in good view and be not plan to make such not to mention paint program in screen ye again what be wa wrong with xv it save image a jpeg jpeg be not design for that also human expect that will be save a image say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it be expect that the image still be the same so xv be design without think about human interface and how human expect the program work design error i have hear xv be design first for but it be not good idea to take full image without make major change to the original design so even all screen image be the process image and save image could have be very easily instead of before anybody will make a note ye i may a well make a lift where mean that the lift go down and mean that the lift go up and put a note on thi design solution to the manual however even the manual tell the correct situation it do solve the problem american the lift be just an example well my text may be a bite hard read hopefully you suggeeded to read it juhana kouhium
