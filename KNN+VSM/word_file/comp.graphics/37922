from rowland jon rowland subject re more gray level out of the screen in article kouhium juhana write in article hollasch steve hollasch write i think you proposal would work to get an extra one maybe two extra bite of color resolution however if you have a display that chould do only zero or full intensity for each primary i do think you get great equivalent photograph i have not suggest to do so i write about problem and the problem be clearly visible with bite b w image not to mention bite image description of experiment delete if the bite image be view quickly and in sync with screen then intensity could be better than we have i dunno more delete in any case get black color with slow machine be problem i could try it on my bite screen but i do know how to render pixel with x in constant time i recall my double buffer ha other image color and one b w that do help either maybe i should dump photo to screen with low level code how a few year ago a friend and i take some grey-level photo from a bite mac plu screen use thi method displaying all level synchronize to the display take about second after experiment with different aperture set and screen brightness we find a range that work well give respectable contrast the quality of the image wa pretty good there be no visible contrast band to minimize the exposure time the display program build different bite frame the first contain a dot only for pixel that have value the second only for pixel that have value etc these frame be store use a sparse datum structure that wa very fast to onto the screen in sequence creating these frame sometime take minute on that old mac but the camera shutter wa close during that time anyway and ye we write directly to the screen memory mea culpa my biggest problem wa that small image be display in the top leave corner of the screen instead of the center it take an extra week to have the film develop and print because the processor take the trouble to manually move the all image into the center of the print who have guess regard jon rowland
