from ferdinan ferdinand oeinck subject re detect double point in bezier curf renner john renner write in article capelli ron ca in ferdinand oeinck write i look for any information on detect calculate a double point cusp in a bezier curve see maureen stone and tony derose a geometric characterization of parametric cubic curf acm tog vol no july pp i use that reference and find that i need to go to their original tech report maureen stone and tony derose characterizing cubic bezier curf xerox december first thank to all who reply to my original question i implement the idea from the article above and i very satisfy with the result i need it for my bezier curve approximation routine in some case generate offset curf loop can occur i now have a fast method of detect the generation of a curve with a loop although i do not follow the article above strictly the check if the fourth control point ly in the the loop area which be bound by two parabola and one ellip be too complicate instead i enlarge the loop-area and surround it by for straight line the check be now simple and fast and my approximation routine never ever output self-intersecting bezier curf again ferdinand
