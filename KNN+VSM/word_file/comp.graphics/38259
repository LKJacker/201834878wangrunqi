from robert robert grant subject virtual reality for x on the cheap hi everyone i think that some person may be interest in my vr software on these group announcing the release of multiverse be a multi-user non-immersive x-window base virtual reality system primarily focus on feature client-server base model use berkeley socket no limit to the number of user apart from performance generic client customizable server hierachical object allow attachment of camera and light source multiple light source ambient point and spot object can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attach functionality client the client be build around a render loop basically it change thing when tell to by the server and then render an image from the user viewpoint it also provide the server with information about the user action which can then be communicate to other client and therefore to other user the client be design to be generic in other word you do need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world thi mean that resource can be spend on enhance the client software rather than adapt it the adaptation a will be explain in a moment occur in the server thi release of the client software support the follow functionality o hierarchical object with associate address o multiple light source and type ambient point and spot o user interface panel o colmy polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rate o mouse and keyboard input some person may be disappoint that thi software do support the powerglove a an input device thi be not because it ca but because i do have one thi will however be one of the first enhancement server s thi be where customization can take place the follow basic support be provide in thi release for potential world server developer o transparent client management o client message handling thi may not sound like much but it take away the headache of accept and terminate client and receive message from them the application writer can work with the assumption that thing be happen locally thing get more interest in the object extension functionality thi be what be provide to allow you to animate ymy object o server selectable extension installation what thi mean be that you can decide which object have extend functionality in ymy world basically you call the extension initialiser you want o event handler registration when you develop extension for an object you basically write callback function for the event that you want the object to respond to current event support init move change collide terminate o collision detection registration if you want ymy object to respond to collision event just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software ymy callback will be activate when a collision occur thi software be keep separate from the worldserver application because the application developer want to build a library of extend object from which to choose the follow be all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function thi be where you choose what object extension will be support plu any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function thi be where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobject function thi be where you load the world wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function thi be where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function thi be where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the object move by call a move function and let the server sleep for a bite to avoid outrun the client that all there be to it and to prove it here be the line count for the three world server i provide generic line dactyl line more complicate collision detection due to the stair will probably be improve with future version dogfight line location thi software be locate at the follow site directory file future client o texture map o more realistic render z-buffering or similar gouraud shade o hmd support o etc etc server o physical modelling gravity friction etc o enhanced object o etc etc both o improved comm i hope thi provide person with a good understand of the multiverse software unfortunately it come with practically zero documentation and i not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectify i hope person enjoy thi software and that it be useful in my exploration of the virtual universe i certainly find fascinate develop it and i would love to add support for the powerglove and an hmd finally one major disclaimer thi be totally amateur code by that i mean there be no support for thi code other than what i out the kindnes of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide i can not be hold responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of thi code use it at ymy own risk disclaimer over of course if you love it i would like to here from you and anyone with positive be also encourage to contact me anyone who hate it and if anyone want to let me do thi for a live you know where to write thank robert robert
