of the above reference start with the foley van dam feiner hughe computer graphic book be certainly a good start chapter be viewing in then read chapter visible-surface determination for more information go to chapter for shade chapter for clip and branch out from there quantizing bite image down to bite find a copy of color image quantization for frame buffer display by paul heckbert siggraph proceedings page there be other algorithm but thi one work well and be fairly simple implementation be include in most raster toolkit see item below a variant method be describe in graphic gem p note that the code from the graphic gem series be all available from an ftp site a describe above check out john bradley diversity algorithm which be incorporate into the xv package and describe in the back of the manual the imagemagick package see section for where it be contain another quantize algorithm which be present a do a better job than the other algorithm but slower there also an implementation of wan wong and prusinkiewicz an algorithm for multidimensional datum clustering transaction on mathematical software vol june pp avialable a thi code in modify form appear in the utah raster toolkit a well converting color into grayscale the ntsc formula be luminosity red green blue quantizing grayscale to black white the only reference you need for thi stuff be digital halftoning robert ulichney mit pres isbn but before you go off and start cod check out the image manipulation software mention in item below all of the package mention can do some form of gray to b w conversion rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle the obviou but wrong method be to loop over the pixel in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination thi be wrong because it leaf hole in the destination instead loop over the pixel in the destination image apply the reverse transformation to the coordinate and copy that pixel from the source thi method be quite general and can be use for any one-to-one map not just rotation you can add anti-aliasing by do sub-pixel sample however there be a much faster method with antialising include which involf do three shear operation the method wa originally create for the im raster toolkit see below an implementation be also present in pbmplu reference a fast algorithm for raster rotation by alan paeth awpaeth graphic interface vancouver an article on the im toolkit appear in the same journal an update version of the rotation paper appear in graphic gem see section under the original title free image manipulation software there be a number of toolkit for convert from one image format to another do simple image manipulation such a size scale plu the above-mentioned color gray gray b w conversion here be pointer to some of them xv by john bradley x-based image display manipulation and format conversion package xv display many image format and permit edit of gif file among other the program wa update see the file on pbmplu by jef poskanzer comprehensive format conversion and image manipulation package the latest version be alway available vium anonymou ftp a and im raster toolkit by alan paeth awpaeth provide a portable and efficient format and relate toolkit the format be versatile in support pixel of arbitrary channel component and bite precision while allow compression and machine

of automate mail server that will send you thing like thi in response to a message see item below for detail on some also the newsgroup be specifically for discussion of software like thi you may find useful information there format document for tiff iff biff nff off fit etc you almost certainly do need these read the above item on free image manipulation software get one or more of these package and look through them chance be excellent that the image converter you be go to write be already there but if you still want one of the format document many such file be available by anonymou ftp from in directory these file be collect off the net and be believe to be correct thi archive include pixel format and two and three-dimensional object format the future of thi archive be uncertain at the moment a mark hall foo will apparently no longer be maintain it a second graphic file format archive be now be actively maintain by quincey koziol koziol the latest version exist at in apparently neither of these be complete you might want to check both fit stand for flexible image transport system it a file format most often use in astronomy despite the name it can contain not only image but other thing a well there be a regular monthly fit basic and information post on read it if you want to know more converting between vector format a lot of person ask about convert from hpgl to postscript or macdraw to cgm or whatever it be important to understand that thi be a very different problem from the image format conversion in item converting one image format to another be a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel be a pixel the basic object be the same for all image format thi be not so for vector format the basic object circle ellipse drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangle etc vary from one format to another except in extremely restrict case it be simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector format there be software for convert to and from cgm file on the contributor state that it run on unix ms-window and possibly the mac a better more specific blurb would be most welcome on the other hand it be quite possible to do a close approximation render an image from one format use the primitive from another a far a i know no one ha put together a general toolkit of such converter but two different hpgl to postscript converter have be post to check the index on ymy nearest archive site a relate frequent question be how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to bitmap for example some of the commercial postscript clone for pc allow you to render to a disk file a well a a printer also the postscript interpreter in the next box and in sun can be use to render to a file if you clever but in general the answer be no however if someone be to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit add a vector to raster converter would be trivial gnu ghostscript from the fsf current version include driver for both ppm and gif format file thu it can be use a a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter it implement essentially all of postscript level and alot of display postscript and level how to get pixar film the variou john lasseter pixar computer animate short be available on video tape you can

approximate a circle the approximation may look acceptable but it be sensitive to scale magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnify deviation from circularity that be not visible in the small can become glare in the large if you want to do the job right consult the article a menagerie of rational b-spline circle by leslie piegl and wayne tiller in ieee computer graphic and application volume number september page for rough non-rational approximation consult the book computational geometry for design and manufacture by i d faux and m j pratt elli horwood publisher

that thi service ha at time be turn off due to abuse how to tell whether a point be within a planar polygon consider a ray originate at the point of interest and continue to infinity if it cross an odd number of polygon edge along the way the point be within the polygon if the ray cross an even number of edge the point be either outside the polygon or within an interior hole form from intersect polygon edge thi idea be know in the trade a the jordan curve theorem see eric haine article in glassner ray trace book above for more information include treatment of special case another method be to sum the absolute angle from the point to all the vertex on the polygon if the sum be pu the point be inside if the sum be the point be outside however thi method be about an order of magnitude slower than the previou method because evaluate the trigonometric function be usually quite costly code for both method plu barycentric triangle test can be find in the ray tracing news vol no
