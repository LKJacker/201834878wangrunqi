from zhao subject full color image editor for sgi workstation i be happy to announce the first public release of the bite program an interactive full color image viewer and editor base on sgi gl beside typical touchup task such a crop rotate smooth etc bite offer some unique feature not available in similar program such a text and vector support and the separation of text and image the follow be the relevant section from the man page pre-release of may bit name bite bitmap image touchup for sgi workstation description bite be an interactive full color image viewer and editor base on silicon graphic gl a a full color program bite handle image of both and color index in a natural and efficient manner a an image viewer bite allow list of image to be display in their original type or color index in any order and in any of the many built-in style of display you can walk up and down the list use mouse and keyboard or you can let bite do the walk for you the slideshow with the pan and zoom feature large image can be view in full without be limit by the window or screen size a an image editor bite perform a large number of image edit and process task accurately and efficiently it keep information los at any stage of the edit proces at an absolute minimum by perform subpixel sample automatically while conserve the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion quantization of input image you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another in addition arbitrarily color and size text and simple geometric figure can be render on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolution postscript bit can also be use a a graphical user interface to many exist image process program by define external bind which in essence turn command line orient program into bite subfunction and can be access by a pres of a button and best of all the process image will be read back and display immediately convolution use exter nally define matrix of arbitrary order can be perform dynamically give great flexibility in process an image feature bit perform all of it image manipulation interactively with a continuou progress report and once the process be complete the process image will be display current feature include o rotate an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing and fill the rotate out region with an arbitrary color o scale an image by arbitrary factor in x y-direction with the option of subpixel sample o render text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an image with the option of render directly into the raster or save the text and raster separately such a into a postscript file to take advantage of a higher printer resolution beside normal text string many predefined special symbol can be input conveniently a in tex alpha small betum produce greek alphabet alpha follow by a slightly smaller greek alphabet betum o present graphically the histogram of an image o perform arbitrary pixel transformation the transformation function can be specify interactively and can be of arbitrary form further the transformation can be apply to rgb channel separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it many difficult task such a thresholding can be accomplish rather easily by transformation in combination with the avai lability of graphical histogram of the image o place simple geometric figure sgf arrow circle trian gle etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at arbitrary location address either in absolute pixel or in some user definable coordinate system unit with the option of render directly into the raster or save the sgf and raster separately postscript file all sgf can be scale in x and y-direction independently or simultaneously thi be how to get an ellipse from a circle o perform edge detection in combination with image histogram and transformation very accurate result can be obtain o perform histogram equalization o perform convolution with externally define square matrix of arbitrary order o crop a rectangular portion of an image o cut and paste acros image o magnify any portion of an image by any amount o display a list of image in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between image slideshow o measure rgb intensity of a pixel at any location or all pixel along an arbitrary line with the result present a rgb intensity or a an intensity v distance plot o perform image type conversion o convert image format o smoothe an image special convolution o filter an image by external program and read the filter image back and display it o modify an individual pixel rgb value o perform fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the result power spectrum o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in thi pre-release supported format o iri rgb native to sgi iri o jpeg jfif format o compuserv gif o pnm portable any map include ppm pgm and pbm o xbm x window bitmap o tiff o postscript write only hardware requirement any sgi workstation that support rgbmode include indigo where to get it anonymou ftp to where xxx be the version number current version be read for installation instruction after unpack acknowledgement jpeg support be base on the independent jpeg group library version form library develop by mark overmar be use for gui both jpeg and form library be include in thi release bit be the program you will ever need to view and annotate image the built-in edit feature will satisfy most of ymy edit need in addition the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already have so try it and you will like it a alway any report be welcome
