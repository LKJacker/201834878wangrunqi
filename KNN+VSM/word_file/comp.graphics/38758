from ldo lawrence waikato university subject quicktime performance wa re rumour about ok with all the discussion about observe playback speed with quicktime the effect of scale and so on i think i do some more test first of all i felt that my original speed test wa perhap le than realistic the movie i have be use only have frame in it it wa a version of the very first movie i create with the compact video compressor i decide something a little longer would give closer to real-world result for better or for worse i pull out a copy of a space odyssey that i have record off tv a while back about fifteen minute into the movie there a sequence where the earth shuttle be approach the space station specifically i digitize a portion of about second duration zoom in on the rotate space station i figure thi would give a reasonable amount of movement between frame to increase the difference between frame i digitize it at only frame per second to give a total of frame i capture the raw footage at a resolution of pixel with the spigot card in my centri quarter-size resolution from a pal source i then import it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor keep the fp frame rate i create two version of the movie one scale to resolution the other at resolution i use the default quality set in premiere and specify a key frame every ten frame i then run the movie through the same raw speed test program i use for the result i be report earlier result a playback rate of over frame per second that right i wa get a much higher result than with that first short test movie just for fun i copy the movie to my external hard disk a quantum and run it from there thi time the playback rate wa only about frame per second obviously the internal hard disk also a quantum be a significant contributor to the speed of playback i modify my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scale factor and try play back the movie scale to size thi time the playback speed wa over fp clearly the poster who observe poor performance on scale playback wa see quicktime in action not i try my test with quicktime but i do think it entirely compatible with my centri and system unscaled the playback rate for the movie wa over fp the other thing i try wa save version of the movie with prefer playback rate greater than and see how well they play from within movieplayer ie with quicktime normal synchronize playback a prefer rate of fp do work too well the playback wa very jerky compare thi with the raw speed test which achieve fp with ease i ca believe that quicktime synchronization code would add thi much overhead i think the slowdown wa come from the mac system task switch a prefer rate of fp seem to work fine i could see any evidence of stutter at fp i think i could see slight stutter but with fmy key frame every second it wa hard to tell i gues i could try recreate the movie with a longer interval between the key frame to make the stutter more noticeable of course thi will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more lawrence fone computer service dept fax university of waikato electric mail ldo hamilton new zealand s e
