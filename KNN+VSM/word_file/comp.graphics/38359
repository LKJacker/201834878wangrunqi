from tsa the silent assassin subject question about plane eqn method of hidden surface removal what be the main advantage of thi method i have see it describe and the algiorithm seem a little bite long i develop my own method which require that the point be in a counter-clockwise order and return whether you be look at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method it use few calculation however basically it be several comparison the only disadvantage i see be that it must be do after the transformation from view coordinate to coordinate to display on the screen which mean that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand my method basically figure out whether the point that will appear on the screen be clockwise or counterclockwise when look at the back of something the point occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figure out which way the point go you can tell whether you be look at the back or front of a polygon ha anyone hear of thi method before it be so simple i doubt i be the first to think of it libertarian atheist semi-anarchal techno-rat i define myself tsa
