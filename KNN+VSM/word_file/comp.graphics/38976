from rajsnr s n rajesh subject looking for a job a a software engineer i be not sure that i be suppose to post thi mail here however during the last year while i wa involve in develop graphical user interface gui application i have enjoy be personally part of thi news group wherin i get some interest information which help me in my work i be post my resume hop that person work in my area would make time to look at it westgate hall isu ame ia april dear prospective employer i be seek employment a a software engineer with interest in software design and development in which i can utilize my experience in hardware c c program graphical user interface gui operate system and computer network i receive my bachelor of engineering be degree in electronic engineering in and a degree in electrical engineering in dec from iowa state university currently i be enrol in a in computer engineering at iowa state university during my master program a a research assistant since jan i have publish three paper include one in the ieee transaction on magnetic these paper be a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability to learn new concept quickly i have be involve in many project involve software development and have extensive experience program in c c fortran and assembly level i be also familiar with operate system like unix ultrix and ms-do i be familiar with program and currently a a research assistant be involve in graphical user interface gui design use the multiplatform gui toolkit xvt my experience also include area such a operate system and computer network through course work and project i wa involve in the study of the design and development of the internal of the xinu operate system i have also be involve in many program project in computer network while in college i learn the importance of clear and concise communication i have also learn a lot about time management in my program i have maintain a grade average work hour per week and have enjoy be involve in many other extra curricular activity my software experience along with my hardware background electronic engineering would be very helpful in my career goal a a software engineer i request that my qualification may kindly be review i would like to have an interview to discus ymy employment need and my career goal i be eager to hear from you soon sincerely rajesh
