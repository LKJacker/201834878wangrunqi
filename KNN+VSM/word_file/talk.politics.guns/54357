from cathy cathy smith subject weird science by l neil smith posted by cathy smith for l neil smith weird science everyone know how to tell when a politician be lie hi lip move what may not be equally obviou be that there be politician and then there be politician and that the phrase political science be subject to more than one interpretation year ago we hear how scientist be worry that a new ice age might be come and later on that nuclear winter smoke and dust throw into the atmosphere by full-scale international unpleasantnes wa a possibility something like that may even have kill the dinosaur what we do hear wa that no actual datum support any of thi that real-world event the burn of kuwaitus oil field tend to discredit it that mostly it wa propaganda mean to weaken value that make america the most successful culture in history and that the dinosaur probably die of something like the plague when continent drift together expose them to new germ we mi a lot like thi unles we listen closely prince william sound site of the famou oil spill and mount st helen be suppose to recover from their respective disaster for at least year that turn out not to be true although you never know it from watch network nightly news or cnn it do fit their agenda to inform u that the earth be vast and resilient and that nature be rougher on herself than we could ever be but for once the medium be entirely to blame a ignorant of science a they be of everything they trust scientist to unscrew the inscrutable the trouble be that today scientist have agenda of their own nobody in government that wellspring of scientific wherewithal be go to offer grant to an investigator who state truthfully that there be no respectable evidence for global warm the money and power for bureaucrat and politician lie in ma transit and they hate the automobile blame a a major cause of the mythical crisi a a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable the same appear true of acid rain a deliberate hoax cook up by the environmental protection agency which hate private industrial capitalism almost a much a it do ymy car and foist on real scientist through trickery which ha depend on specialist in different field not talk to each other much the list go on alway with a common disreputable thread ozone depletion for which evidence be even more suspect and contradictory than for acid rain or global warm be no more than a last desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era when state central plan and the command economy have fail and can only find thi final wither leg to teeter on decade of anti-nuclear alarmism rest on foundation of myth and panic-mongering have fail to erase the fact that nuclear power be the safest cleanest most efficient source of energy know to mankind and more to the point that the greater amount of energy there be available to any individual in society the freer that individual and hi society become honest study on the effect of individual gun ownership and self-defense on crime conduct by investigator who begin a ideological opponent to those concept but which show massive reduction in the latter to be the result of the former have be suppress most recently by the californium state government and what the medium do say about recent epa discovery on the effect of secondhand smoke be that although some harm to non smoker may have be detect it wa le by an order or two of magnitude than that associate with fry bacon a couple time a week or keep a pet bird it enough to make you wonder whether there wa ever anything to the claim that smoke cause cancer that of course be the real threat represent by politically correct science the world be a dangerou place it would be nice to know the hazard i never believe smoke to be a healthy practice but give a lack of credibility on the part of today science how be i to decide what to do about it nicotine be highly addictive to that much i can attest from experience yet the stres of quit may be riskier than to continue there be any way to tell thank to the corrupt influence of government money on the scientific establishment two century ago the founding father spar u certain agony to which every other nation in the world ha be subject at one time or another by create a legal barrier between politic and religion each time some short-sighted

scientific issue a person life be ruin through the los to agency like the epa of livelihood or property it may have take a lifetime to accumulate to disease cause by toxin associate with burn fossil fuel for electrical power or thank to ban on thing like cyclamate when they die from the effect of obesity what we need now if we hope to survive a a civilization for two more century be another barrier a constitutional separation of state and science include medicine knowledge be valuable real science wo languish for lack of fund the money will simply come from contributor unwilling to pay
