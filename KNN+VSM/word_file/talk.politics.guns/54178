from joan subject re gun in backcountry no thank in article guy guy m trotter write hi in canada any gun that enter a national park must be seal i think it a small metal tag that place over the trigger the net result of thi be that you use a gun to protect yourself from bear or psycho in the national park instead one ha to be sensitive to the danger and annoyance of hike in bear country and take the appropriate precaution i think thi policy make the user of the national park feel a little closer to nature that they be a part of nature and a such have to deal with nature on it own term guy hello i understand thi philosophy the bear be a national treasure the area be their sanctuary and person who enter it do so at their own risk it be better that that rare human be kill by a bear than that bear be provoke or shoot by unbear-savvy visitor the bear be have a population explosion human be so it be better that a human be kill than endanger the bear i do agree with thi philosopy but i understand it the psycho be a bite different they be not a national treasure but i suppose the decision ha be make that to allow provision for defense against them would also allow provision for defense against bear again i suppose it ha be decide that it be better for the rare human to be kill by a psycho than to take a chance on threaten the bear personally i would go into an area where i would be manage so a to reduce my safety but come to think of it i gues i live in a manage wildernes myself joan v
