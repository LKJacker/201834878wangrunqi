from subject re gun buy back on thu apr gmt write firearm be the fifth-leading cause of unintentional death among child age and under from the rkba archive total firearm death for child through at be one of the smallest cause of death in child car fall burn drown food ingestion be all much larger cause of death so firearm be the lead cause after drown and choke on food at least for sorry charle according to the national safety council accident in gun accident be the fifth-leading cause of accidental death for child age and under i do understand how the ratio to other accidental death be important so gun do kill a many child a car accident what be the difference in severity between death and death the difference be that a rational person would addres the lead cause first and addres the lesser cause later that think be so screw up i do even know how to respond to it a rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle death and not attempt to affect childhood fall drown gunshot injury etc so thi so call rational person use ymy definition if he or she be attempt to affect the lead cause of death for adult age through would only worry about cancer and would not try to decrease lesser cause such a heart disease injury stroke suicide liver disease chronic lung disease homicide hiv infection or diabetes oh okay charle that make a lot of sense i tell you what charle i call the heart foundation and suicide hotline and tell them that they be not act rational and that they can all go home because they be address the lesser cause of death and you call ymy local polouse homicide department liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop address these lesser cause please quit waste my time with thi silly shit charle i get an idea charle why do you start a group or group thi be do confuse the issue just because a social problem may not claim a many victim a another we should not try to addres it i do agree i not post to to debate the suppose severity of cause of childhood death i be really get frigging sick of have to respond to the irrational statement of person who assume that someone who want to discus youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun death be try to make a political issue out of it i assume that any humane person would be concern when any year old get hold of their parent gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blow away one of their friend a humane person who keep a firearm in the house with a year old would also teach thi child how to safely handle the firearm ignorance be my greatest enemy again charle you tend to confuse the issue and take thing out of context for ymy own purpose the statement that you respond to above be actually in reference to a previou post by another person who like you express concern over make youth gun violence a priority i gues maybe humane person and rational person could be interchangeable huh both would be define a a person who only address the social problem that cause the greatest number of childhood death if that be the case i extremely glad that i be inhumane and irrational well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence what other source of information do you have which confirm their datum these folk be well know for misrepresent the fact perhap you can verify their datum with the uniform crime report sorry charle the fbi uniform crime report be well know for misrepresent the fact but if you insist accord to the ucr firearm murder of youngster and under increase percent between and is the national center for health statistic good enough for you they state that every day american child age and under be kill in gun accident suicide and homicide many more be wound or how about the national pediatric trauma registry they say gunshot wind to child age and under nearly double in major urban area between and do you also doubt the american academy of pediatric charle they state that gunshot wind among child in urban area increase from to charle i hope you do need to be convince that youth be increasingly victim of gun injury and that they have easy acces to gun if you do realize thi fact i do care if you go by cdc or fbi datum or if you go into the home school and street where these kid be and take a poll by yourself i not go to bother to try to convince you it obviou that you have rule out any idea of discuss thi issue in a sane fashion and that you be so focus on try to make thi a gun control and political discussion i really do want to do that or the center for disease control they have firearm statistic are firearm a disease charle it obviou that you know nothing about the cdc they do just study cancer and heart disease i get news for you interpersonal gun violence is an epidemic in surgeon general c everett koop declare that gun violence be a much a public health problem a cancer heart disease or auto accident that you greatly underestimate the presence of gun in the life of youth in the life of youth or in their school i know a number of youth who have firearm present in their life is be quite appropriate to teach child to safely handle firearm thi be a presence right what be you try to say thi innuendo remind me of listen to bill clinton who the said anything about teaching child to safely handle firearm charle in the future if you be go to post to and jump into a previou discussion please read the entire post not just sentence that you decide to respond to what the hell be you say here you waste time and space try to make a political and gun control issue out of a discussion that be the cphv report that youth bring gun to school daily and that bring gun to school at least once a year i would trust their statistic without independent verification the cdc estimate that out high school student carry a gun to school at least once in based on cphv statistic based on ucr based on what the cdc also say that million elementary-aged latch-key child kid who come home from school to an empty house have acces to gun in their home therefore what be the purpose of thi claim charle buddy i get really tire of thi do you live on the planet mar a a physicist i realize that you probably do come into contact with many youth but i really think you need to make a trip to ymy local urban high school and discover the joy of gun in school in addition spend a few minute talk to these kid ask them if they have ever hear gunshot in their neighborhood whether they know anyone who ha be shoot whether they know anyone who ha a gun whether they have ever hold a gun and whether they themself have ever be shoot believe me charle that will be ymy independent verification rodney w thoma urban child research center cleveland state university cleveland oh
