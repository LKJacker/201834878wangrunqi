from vincent vincent fox subject re my gun be like my american expres card in jason kratz write delete and a far a fully-automatic weapon you can be a lot better arm if you want to hit what you aim at what seem to be happen here be the situation get totally blow out of proportion in my post i wa refer to ymy regular patrolman in a car cruise around the city v gang member of course the polouse have acces to the thing that you mention but do they use tank and such all of the time of course they do and that the point i wa try to make every day when i go out to lunch i alway see cop come in the majority that i see be still carry revolver not that there be anything wrong with a revolver but if you a cop that be up against some gang member with a couple of automatic in hi coat i mean semi-auto handgun you go to be at a disadvantage even with train i have be at a shoot range where gang gang member be practice shoot they be actually practice take out their gun a quick a possible and shoot at the target and they be do too badly either the university cop here who be be state cop be arm better than the chicago polouse it seem most state cop be define arm better go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the colt do one fire faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire be usually not desirable sure it make the other guy duck for cover but just you try hit anything with a thompson in hose-mode thi be why the military be limit it now to burst-fire simple semi-auto would be better but the troop like to be able to rock and roll even if it be wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy be plentiful a revolver be equally capable a a semi-auto in the same caliber a revolver also ha the advantage that if it misfire you just pull the trigger again a double-action revolver almost all of them can be hand-cocked first but will fire merely by pull the trigger a misfire in a revolver merely mean you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round a revolver can be carry with the chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be draw and fire with an easy motion even one hand speedloader for a revolver allow reload almost a fast a magazine on semi-auto can be faster depend on user a misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jam shell first time spend which can be fatal and a vital second or so be often lose a you realize hey it jam before start to do anything about clear it most semi-auto must have the slide work to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some polouse carry their semi-auto with the chamber load and hammer cock but a safety engage i do not consider thi safe however you must trade-off safety to get the same speed of employment a a revolver there be some double-action semi-auto out there but the complexity of operation of many of them require more train some polouse department switch to glock and then start quietly switch many officer back to the old revolver too many be have accident partly due to the poor train they receive not that glock require rocket scientist but some cop be baffle by something a complex a the timer on a vcr anyone who go anyone say that the criminal obviously outgun the polouse do know nothing about firearm turn off cop and hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say semi-auto be junk merely that assume they be better for all job be stupid a cop with a revolver on hi hip and a shotgun in the rack be more than equip for anything short of a riot gun control be hit what you aim at if you whip out a wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you do hit anything good control fire from a revolver be more likely to get you a hit i own a berettum myself but consider it inferior a a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i have hit what i aim at in the first shoot something be quite seriously wrong somewhere while i might like have the backup capacity of those extra shoot in certain case overwhelmingly the of shoot fire in criminal encounter be le than what do crook overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple revolver that the polouse often use well actually some polouse prefer the much heftier magnum but anyway obplea do flame me i prefer semi-auto for most thing but they introduce unneccessary complication to something a nerve-wracking a an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal if everything have go a plan everything would have be perfect batf spokesperson on cnn regard fail raid attempt in tx
