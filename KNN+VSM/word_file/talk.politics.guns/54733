from andy andy freeman subject re gun in backcountry no thank in article john k gever write public health expert will tell you that you be far more likely have ymy gun steal use it yourself on a family member or have it use on you than you be to use it on an actual criminal actually they wo what they tell you be that if you add up the number of suicide murder of one drug dealer by another legit self-defense of a batter spouse and so on you end up with a number that be much larger than the number of self-defense kill against stranger commit in the bedroom btw they do honestly count the latter either but let not quibble they try to claim that comparison be between the cost of self-defense and the benefit but they wrong thi comparison do measure the cost of self-defense and it do measure the benefit either for example the goal be not to kill the attacker whatever ymy relationship to him but to stop him while the number of kill may be proportional to the number of stop it be equal anyone who confuse that comparison with an honest evaluation be either lie or andy
