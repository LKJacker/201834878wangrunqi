from pat pat myrto subject re tank against civilian wa re that silly outdated in article scottj john l scott write pick nit over tank fire the main gun or not delete i think the point be be miss that it be apparantly acceptable for big government big brother to use tank to control the person a long a they do use the big gun but everything else be allright tank deploy against civilian let alone firing on them with crew serve weaponry a heavy machine gun be crew-served be something both my pres and government howl about instantly when do in some other country against civilian that have at most one-shot-at-a-time light small arm certainly nothing that place the person in or behind the tank in any real danger molotov coctail a round from a rifle or pistol deal with anybody approach with one of those and sniper too often turn out to be stray from other gunfire i do know about the other person in thi group or on the net but the idea of tank be use to control civilian in anything that pretend to be a free society be outrageou when big government feel it be necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protest even violent of the citizen that suggest that the government be totally out of control since that be effectively the government declare war on it own person if the government wa live up to it responsibility government of the person by the person not the and other elite who want to keep their good thing go the citizen would feel the need to be resort to act that need to be squash with a military boot person do thing like that because they have become convince that it be the only option that remain other attempt to have grievance redress have be ignore and ye there be a criminal element that will exploit thi but the fact remain that the government ha be unresponsive or such act would be apt to happen still not an excuse to open up on civilian with tank heavy machine gun or whatever it the old make right philosophy that be the hallmark of a government go rogue they do like it tough we will simply squash them under an iron boot actually address their grievance in other than token fashion with huge volume of hot air be just too inconvenient sort of a variation on mushroom management keep them in the dark smother them with shit and crush them when ready and these be the folk that many liberal be try to arrange thing so that they will have a monopoly on coercive force firearm that be than expensive toy by gutting the bill of right cuz it just be progressive or do fit in with modern thinking anymore unbelievable and i do believe amid the smoke confusion etc of a real riot situation that it would be possible for a tank to get away with fire the main gun into a build at close range one would hear an explosion among many explosion it be loud but it be not go to stand out like a pound bomb or a tactical nuke there would be a hole blow in the wall and some rubble but with tank knock over wall and other source of build turn into rubble and other cover racket such a gunfire include tack away it would not stand out that much and could be explain by mustum be a ga leak i think it could be do and not be report under such condition it be possible it be not like a tank drive down a quiet street on a sunday afternoon turn and fire you know that would stand out and be pretty impossible to cover up john l scott pat without prejudice ucc pat myrto seattle wa if all else fail try uunet pilchuck rwing pat wisdom only two thing be infinite the universe and human stupidity and i be not sure about the former albert einstien
