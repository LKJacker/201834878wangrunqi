from kennej kennedy jame scot subject re waco survivor april from article by hallam phill hallam-baker in article apm andrew merritt write path dscomsa dxcern mcsun uknet pipex uunet apm from apm andrew merritt in article chorley write stuff about british cult member delete what exactly be you try to say and why be there no fire-engine within a mile of the compound because the gun loony be fire on vehicle with amunition that ha a range of meter they be use caliber ammunition not ammo would be a shell of thi size would be larger than a lot of cannon shell sniper could have screen the person try to put out the fire beside the ranch house not fort apocalypse it wa just a house despite what the fbi and atf say wa on fire the gun loony could hardly have be shoot at fire man while there house wa engulf in flame the fbi and atf do have any excuse for not have fire engine there to put out the blaze the bastard wait until the fire wa well under way before they call the fire department in waco they do even tell the fire department to be on standby i sincerely hope that the fbi atf attorney general janet reno and all other involve in thi fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve someone should pay for thi needle tragic waste of human life sadly these evil sob will probably never face justice the medium and the government will just whitewash thi incident and chalk it up a be solely david koresh fault sadder still the american person will probably believe them next question the problem be of course the law that allow a bunch of rave nutter to collect a huge stack of arm in the first place thi be not the problem the problem be that we have a government that be become more tyrannical every day if person decide to own gun and live in one place together then that be their prerogative on the other hand if the bd be in posession of explosive and illegal gun then the government do have the right to search their compound but the allegation that the bd be in posession of illegal weapon ha be prove yet so i not go to conclude that the bd break any law david koresh wa accuse of abuse child but if thi be hi only crime then the presence of the atf ca be justify the atf be only suppose to deal with firearm tobacco and alcohol violation atf agent be basically cigarette cop they should stay out of other kind of law-enforcement action that be out of their jurisdiction better yet they should be imo the sequence of event mean that there really wa no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough vium an intervention if the fbi have have the stomach for it they could have mount a commando type raid and attempt to save the child by shoot all the adult sound like something the ss would do human life child and adult alike should be treat with respect even if they be heavily-armed religiou wacko david koresh lawyer seem to think that everyone would come out peacefully sooner or later the fbi and atf have nothing but time on their hand why do they have to escalate the situation and cause thi senseles tragedy their job be to protect the public and save life not kill person for cry out loud it really wa a no win situation koresh have plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the atf officer instead he order the murder of the child do be so sure about that i read in a newspaper today that one of the cult member say that when one of the tank go through the wall that it knock over a lantern which cause the ranch house to be catch on fire thi cult member also say that david koresh have no intention of commit ma suicide david koresh lawyer also confirm thi therefore if thi be true then thi mean that the fbi and atf murdered everyone in that house even if thi be not true the fbi and atf still do get off the hook because they wait a damn long time to call the waco fire department perhap they want all these person to die in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it be neccessary to beleive the word of a man who ha just murder child and order the of hi other follower according to the account give the batf attempt to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and be meet by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the supporter claim that the batf start shoot simply do not stand up if the aft have go there to start shoot they would have go with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handgun for all practical purpose they be unarm the b-d follower have automatic weapon you wrong on several account atf agent be adequately arm they have and shotgun some agent be arm with automatic pistol but not all be the atf initial claim which they later retract that agent be underarmed be simply ludicrou the b-d seige could not be allow to go on indefinitely the b-d be quite capable of commit ma suicide and murder the child at any time a commando assault wa the only other likely action that could have achieve that objective that would have be very risky order of magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige airplane and embassy be not design for defense against attack ranch apocalypse wa terrorist be far easier to disloge without casualty than allowing the siege to go on wa not an option either beside the seriou risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there wa the question of the difficulty of keep the emmergency team on standby over a prolong period the longer the siege go on the more mentally prepare koresh and hi follower would be for a prolong siege rather than go in prematurely the mistake wa probably to go in too soon can you think of a better way of get the child out a certain way the person who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story thi be simply rationalisation it be not enough for them to simply dismis the government a incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themself instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decide to set out to murder person just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through gun control be the only issue here if the sick little monkey in washington try to use the waco incident a a reason to ban gun then they will have demonstrate just how up they be what concern me much more than new gun control legislation be that the government seem to be able to get away with like they do in waco they be become more and more callou about person right and the law thi greatly disturb me and it should disturb you a well thi conspiracy theory assume that the batf deliberately get of it agent kill and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sit out in the middle of texa be shoot at by religiou nutter still the conspiracy theory be comfort it allow them to pretend that waco prove nothing except about how incompetent the government be in resolve a hostage crisi no govt in the world ha ever face a comparable situation quite probably there wa no manner in which it could be peacefully resolve the blame do not rest on the fbi it rest on the fact that koresh wa allow to get so far in particular the person who tip the b-d off in advance ha the murder of atf agent and child on hi or her conscience there be a large number of person in the u who predict the end of society preach salvation through arm security the fact be that these be the very person who pose the threat to society in the first place the next waco may not be religiou nutter but a political movement a splinter group of the klu klux klan take over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and hold several hundred child hostage the only possible solution to such situation that can work be to prevent them arise no other government in the world ha face such a situation thi be because no other government ha so carelessly allow high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be messiah to set themself up a dictator in their own little empire phill hallam-baker scott
