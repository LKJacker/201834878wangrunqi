from viking dan sorenson subject re the usual arc aaron ray clement write i wa under the impression that to obtain fissionable material plutonium or uranium one wa require to obtain a federal permit to own such material no you merely have to start work on yellowcake or else devise a system to get it from other source btw the doe handle reactor fuel and merely lease it to reactor the nrc certify these reactor the military have their own source a private citizen ha none of these official source actually why bother look it up from the material we cover last term in week of nuclear chemistry i could derive what it would take to build a bomb that freshman-level chemistry big deal can you make it work that phd-level physic big difference and a far a the explosive charge i a a chemist could synthesize a variety of explosive from commonly available chemical in the garage if i felt like the electronic behind the detonator and the shape charge be a little trickier however but not impossible use a few trick of the trade and if i really want to be nasty i could include a core of hydrogen and deuterium so you admit that there no law that could stop you physic aside could you make one if you have the fund and time the answer be ye so do we lock you up now because of thi surely you can see where the comparison with anti-gun law come into play here of course the hardest part be get the fissionable material to start with and live long enough to put a bomb together plutonium ha some nasty property precisely why it not a readily utilize a you seem to have be lead to believe btw be far better for home-made bomb than try to use plutonium the law of physic make the creation of a device without seriou manufacture facility very low in probability dan sorenson dod viking isu only censor what i read not what i say do blame them usenet post to exotic distant machine meet excite unusual person and flame them
