try to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which have illegally stockpile weaponry and ammunition and place innocent child at risk because the batf operation have fail to meet it objective a standoff ensue the federal bureau of investigation then make every reasonable effort to bring thi perilou situation to an end without bloodshed and further los of life the bureau effort be ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they be deal david koresh wa dangerou irrational and probably insane he engage in numerou activity which violate both federal law and common standard of decency he wa moreover responsible for the death and injury which occur during the action against the compound in february given hi inclination toward violence and in an effort to protect hi young hostage no provocative action be take for more than seven week by federal agent against the compound thi weekend i wa brief by attorney general reno on an operation prepare by the fbi design to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan include a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear ga that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it wa hop force the person in the compound to come outside and to surrender i wa inform of the plan to end the siege i discuss it with attorney general reno i ask the question i think it wa appropriate for me to ask i then tell her to do what she think wa right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday action end in a horrible human tragedy mr koresh response to the demand for hi surrender by federal agent wa to destroy himself and murder the child who be hi captive a well a all the other person who be there who do not survive he kill those he control and he bear ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensue now we must review the past with an eye toward the future i have direct the united stated department of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorou and thorough investigation to uncover what happen and why and whether anything could have be dne differently i have tell the department to involve independent professional law enforcement official in the investigation i expect to receive analysi and answer in whatever time be require to complete the review finally i have direct the department to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiry so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american person i want to expres my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agent on the front line who do the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstance again i want to say a i do yesterday i be very sorry for the los of life which occur at the begin and at the end of thi tragedy in waco i hope very much that other who will be tempt to join cult and to become involve with person like david koresh will be deter by the horrible scene they have see over the last seven week and i hope very much that the difficult situation which federal agent confront there and which they will be doubtles require to confront in other context in the future will be somewhat better handle and better understand because of what ha be learn now q mr president can you first of all tell u why after day you decide q mr president can you describe for u what it be that janet reno outline to you in ymy phone conversation with the president i ca hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno q mr president the president i answer both ymy question but i ca do it at once q can you describe what she tell you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you know about it the president ye i wa tell by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time have come to take another step in try to dislodge the person in the compound and she describe generally what the operation would be that they want to go in and use tear ga which have be test not to cause permanent damage to adult or to child but which would make it very difficult for person to stay inside the build and it wa hop that the tear ga would permit them to come outside i wa further tell that under no circumstance would my person fire any shoot at them even if fire upon they be go to shoot the tear ga from armor vehicle which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact a you know an awful lot of shoot be fire by the cult member at the federal official there be no shoot come back from the government side i ask a number of question the first question i ask be why now we have wait seven week why now the reason i wa give be the follow number one that there wa a limit to how long the federal authority could maintain with their limit resource the quality and intensity of coverage by expert there they might be need in other part of the country number two that the person who have review thi have never see a case quite like thi one before and they be convince that no progress have be make recently and no progress wa go to be make through the normal mean of get koresh and the other cult member to come out number three that the danger of their do something to themself or to other wa likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number fmy that they have reason to believe that the child who be still inside the compound be be abuse significantly a well a be force to live in unsanitary and unsafe condition so for those reason they want to move at that time the second question i ask the attorney general be whether they have give consideration to all of the thing that could go wrong and evaluate them against what might happen that wa good she say that the fbi personnel on the scene and those work with them be convince that the chance of bad thing happen would only increase with the passage of time the third question i ask wa ha the military be consult a soon a the initial tragedy come to light in waco that the first thing i ask to be do because it wa obviou that thi wa not a typical law enforcement situation military person be then bring in help to analyze the situation and some of the problem that be present by it and so i ask if the military have be consult the attorney general say that they have and that they be in basic agreement that there wa only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military something that both side think wa not of overwhelm significance having ask those question and get those answer i say that if she think it wa the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr president the president wait go ahead q can you addres the widespread perception report widely television radio and newspaper that you be try somehow to distance yourself from thi disaster the president no i bewilder by it the only reason i make no public statement yesterday let me say the only reason i make no public statement yesterday be that i have nothing to add to what wa be say and i literally do not know until rather late in the day whether anybody wa still alive other than those who have be actually see and take to the hospital or take into custody it wa purely and simply a question of wait for event to unfold there wa i have i ca account for why person speculate one way or the other but i talk to the attorney general on the day before the action take place i talk to her yesterday i call her again late last night after she appear on the larry king show and i talk to her again thi morning a president it be not possible for a president to distance himself from thing that happen when the federal government be in control i will say thi however i wa frankly surprise would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religiou fanatic murder themself applause i regret what happen but it be not possible in thi life to control the behavior of other in every circumstance these person kill fmy federal official in the line of duty they be heavily arm they fire on federal official yesterday repeatedly and they be never fire back on we do everything we could to avoid the los of life they make the decision to immolate themself and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the child but in the end the last comment i have from janet reno be when and i talk to her on sunday i say now i want you to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she say it because of the child they have evidence that those child be still be abuse and that they in increasingly unsafe condition and that they do think it will get any easier with time with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that be where i think thing stand q can we assume then that you do think thi wa mishandle in view of the outcome that you do run out of patience and if you have it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no well i think what you can assume be just exactly what i announce today thi be a the fbi ha do a lot of thing right for thi country over a long period of time thi be the same fbi that find the person that bomb the world trade center in lickety-split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the step along the way is there something else we should have know is there some other question they should have ask is there some other question i should have ask can i say for sure that no one that we could have do nothing else to make the outcome come different i do know that that why i want the inquiry and that why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement person not political person but totally non-political outside expert who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there be unfortunately a rise in thi sort of fanaticism all acros the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there be anything we can do particularly when there be child involve but i do think it be important to recognize that the wrong-doer in thi case be the person who kill other and then kill themself q mr president be there any other option present to you for resolve thi situation at any point from february until yesterday the president well ye i get regular report all along the way there be lot of other option pursue if you go back you all cover it very well the fbi you do a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authority there pursue any number of other option all along the way and a lot of them early on seem to be work some of the child get out some of the other person leave there wa a at one point there seem to be some line of communication open up between koresh and the authority and then he would say thing and not do them and thing just begin to spin downward whether there be other in term of what happen yesterday the conversation i have with the attorney general do not involve other option except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we be pursue because they say they want to do thi because they think thi wa the best way to get person out of the compound quickly before they could kill themself that what they think q did the government know that the child do not have ga mask q congressional hear once the situation be you in agreement with that the president that up to the congres they can do whatever they want but i think it very important that the treasury and justice department launch thi investigation and bring in some outside expert and a i say in my statement if any congressional committee want to look into it we will fully cooperate there be nothing to hide here thi wa probably the most well-covered operation of it kind in the history of the country more more
