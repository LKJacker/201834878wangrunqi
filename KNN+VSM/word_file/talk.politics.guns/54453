from jrutledg john lawrence rutledge subject re some more about gun control in article cescript charle scripter write thi mention of a well regulate militium be what confuse me according to the federalist paper a well regulate militium ha a well define structure and follow nationally uniform regulation perhap you should actually read the federalist paper perhap you should reread federal which deal exclusively with the well regulate malitium here be what be say about it character to oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other class of the citizen to be under arm for the purpose of go through military exercise and evolution a often a might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militium it also talk about the well regulate militium have a nationally uniform in structure and disipline i will note you do quote the end of thi particular paragraph which state little more can reasonably be aim at with respect to the person at large than to have them properly arm and equip and in order to see that thi be not neglect it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year but do you know how much organization be require to train a large group of poeple twice a year just to try to get the same person every year provide a basic train to new person so they can be integrate into the force and find a suitable location it require a continually stand committee of organizer since a well regulate militium be nationally uniform in structure and disipline and meet once or twice a year to train how can you claim a well regulate militium be not well organize but i will concide a well organize militium be not necessarily a well regulate militium several person have state that the well organize militium be what be define under usc which state the militium of the united state consist of all able-bodied male at least year of age and except a provide in section of title under year of age who be or who have make a declaration of intention to become citizen of the united state and of female citizent of the united state who be commission officer of the national guard thi deo define the militium but be be the adjective well regulate usc do not define a well regualed militium in any way shape or form it only define who can become part of a well regulate militium the federalist paper clearly define the well regualed militium a a proper subset of the militium in the same paragraph quote above it talk above discipline all the militium of the united state so they fit the character of a well-regulated militium thi be what the paragraph state about the associate cost it would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country to an amount which calculate upon the present number of the person would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishment of all the state to attempt a thing which would abridge the ma of labor and industry to so considerable an extent would be unwise and the experiment if make could not succeed because it would not long be endure another quote provide by charle scripter be jame madison federalist paper regard the general welfare clause nothing be more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particular so the phrase the right of the person to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe must either qualify or explain the phrase a well regulate militium be necessary to the security of a free state the definition of explain a state in the american hertitage dictionary of the enlish language the new college edition be to make plain or comprehensible remove obscruity from elucidate it wa the economist who undertake to explain thi puzzle to define explicate expound he explain hi plan to offer reason for or a cause of an answer for justify explain an error the second phrase clearly do not explain the first therefore the second phrase must qualify the first the definition give for qualify be to describe by enumerate the characteristic or quality of characterize to make competent or suitable for office position or task to give legal power to make legally capable to modify limit or restrict a give exception to make le harsh or severe moderate grammar to modify the mean of a word or phrase since the right of the person to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe do not describe modify or make le harsh anything and it ha nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task by proces of elimination it must fall into definition and since deal with legal power the same thing the constitution do it must be the correct definition in thi case therefore the right of the person to keep and bear arm gife legal power to the well regualated militium and thi legal power shall not be infringe i thank you very much mr scripter you have provide me with more evidence that the second amendment only concern itseft with the person right to form well regulate militium and say very little about the right of an untrained person to keep and bear a caliber machine gun and since i totally untrained in the use of any firearm something i personly have mean to correct by go to a nra gun safety course and join a gun club can not legally buy such a machine gun i conclude the court and democraticly elect congres agree with me so now we know which category mr rutledge be in he mean to destroy my liberty and right i mean to destory my liberty and right is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what my libertue and right be i force my version of my liberty and right by begin statement of what my liberty and right with all that the second amendment clearly state to me using expression such a state to me clearly mean i intend to force my view on other i do think so so in effort not to force my view and not to destory my liberty and right i state that nothing i have write or will write in the matter of liberty and right be the final word for i be only one person among many and the final word on liberty and right cleary and irrevocably belong to the many if only it be a modern document with
