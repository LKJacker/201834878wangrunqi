from fcrary frank crary subject re the usual in article viking dan sorenson write ye i be pro-gun and ye i do disagree with thi statement nuclear weapon in and of themself be dangerou radioactive decay of plutonium and uranium a well a the tritium in the weapon tend to be somewhat dangerou to live thing can you say neutron flux can you say i get more background radiation from live in denver or have an office in a limestone build than i do stand next to a power reactor at full power or stand next to a nuclear warhead that be arm look up shield in ymy dictionary you do need six foot of lead to make decent shield ymy dead skin cell layer do an excellent job on alpha particle and neutron be slow by mere water what do you think of you be but whatever the neutron hit ha a good chance of absorb the neutron and become radioactive itself mostly that mean water turn into harmles heavy water but some neutron would also hit bone and the result harmfull secondard radioactive would remain in the body for decade i think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be consider a public health hazard a for a shield warhead i think a fair amount of maintaince be require for it to remain safely shield storage in a dry temperature-regulated facility etc for private ownership to be unregulated i think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon but keep it in a safe condition if any random private citizen could not properly keep maintain and store a nuclear weapon then some regulation be clearly appropriate plu these thing have no self defense purpose it kinda hard to justify their use a a militium weapon when at best they be mean for battlefield use low-yield weapon or at worst for industrial target obliteration translation city and population center if the militium ha a it job the overthrow of an illegal government they be indeed useful weapon to the militium i disagree with thi purpose the job of the militium be to defend themself and their community if you look at the american revolution a an example the militia win by seperating themself from and become independent of a repressive government they do overthrow it and those community canada and england for example that do defend themself be still under that same old regime if the role of the militium be offensive to go out and destroy repressive government nuclear weapon might be appropriate but their job be defensive and nuclear weapon be suit for that there be also the question of personal and collective arm the second amendment definately protect ownership of personal weapon since the very nature of the militium require member to provide their own arm but it be clear if it cover other arm certainly not all member would supply for example a tank only a few could or if they be to be use effectively should however those provide the heavy weapon have a disproportionate control over the militium and it fierpower the militia a the framer envision them be extremely democratic if only of the member support the cause only would respond to a muster and the militium firepower would be proportionately reduce militium firepower and the popular will be therefore link but if a small minority of the member supply a large fraction of the firepower in the form of heavy weapon thi would all change the militium firepower would depend on the will of a small minority not of the general public worse that minority would be quite different from the general public at the very least they would be much richer a a result i think the nature and character of the militium require that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militium firepower hi personal weapon and some equitable fraction of a squad heavier firepower frank crary cu boulder
