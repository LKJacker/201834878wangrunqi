from guy guy m trotter subject re gun in backcountry no thank hi in canada any gun that enter a national park must be seal i think it a small metal tag that place over the trigger the net result of thi be that you use a gun to protect yourself from bear or psycho in the national park instead one ha to be sensitive to the danger and annoyance of hike in bear country and take the appropriate precaution i think thi policy make the user of the national park feel a little closer to nature that they be a part of nature and a such have to deal with nature on it own term guy
