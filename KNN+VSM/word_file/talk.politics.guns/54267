from david veal subject re my gun be like my american expres card in article thoma parsli thomasp write overall crime rate it fell just like that two question when wa thi and do you have the relevant number please note thi be not in any way an indication i do believe you or that you not correct but when the drop occur be relevant acquiring weapon in norway you can buy almost all kind of weapon in norway but you must have a permit and a good reason to get the permit if i would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gun-licence from the polouse and to be a member of a gun-club the primary objection beyond one base on the ideal of rkba that it be simply not something the government should do be that it make gun a play-thing and tool of the rich and connect it discriminate against the poor is self-defense consider appropriate and if so under what condition are you allow for instance to get a gun for protection if you go to be carry a very large sum of money on a regular basi or have be threaten the polouse would check my criminal record for any seriou crime record of seriou mental disease thi ha be suggest in the and generally support among gun owner what many object to be that many if not most proposal contain a sort of gotcha clause which allow an arbitrary denial even if you qualify in every way now if a get my licence i would have to be an active member of the gun club for month before i could collect my gun it a little like get a driver licence be it you have to prove that you can drive before you be allow to at thi point it should be point out that in general a driver licence in the be for the most part nothing like it european counterpart i understand get one be far more difficult there than here in the it a joke but my usual objection be that you discuss two different thing for instance in the a driver license be a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road it be not necessary to own one or to operate it on private property that be the ability to require drive permit be generally consider to arise from the government legitimate power to enact reasonable regulation for behavior on public land a permit to own an automobile for instance which be far closer an analogy would be a much harder thing to get past legally since it would be base on make regulation on public property but in restrict activity on private property use of gun in crime in norway some crime be commit with gun that have be in the owner for a long time but these be rather the exeption most criminal accuire gun to use them in crime and mostly short time befor the crime use of knife it is allow to cary knife in public but not in ymy belt or you american think it ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth thi vary widely one thing i think european have a difficult time with be that the ha fifty unique jurisdiction where the law from one state to another can be a radically different a from one country in europe to another some place allow open carry of both gun and knife some allow conceal some prohibit both or allow one or the other and it can be either a state or local restriciton individual v mass ye the individual be more important than the mass but only to some extent ymy criminal law be to protect the individual who make the mass what happen when the rigth of some individual affect the right of all the other the question must be ask is the right of thi individual affect the right of thi other individual what we usually get be that the right of thi group mean some individual within thi group here define a person who own gun be adversely affect the right of some other group if for instance bob be use hi gun to attack steve you have a point but essentially what we discuss be that becuase some person who qualify a a member of the group person who own gun then some third person perhap in another time zone be tell that their be a member of that group be take away somebody else right it like try to punish all newspaper for the libel commit by one the issue i believe the issue be gun and gun-legislation the issue be crime violence and murder the question be to what extent gun and gun legislation impact those we should mix weapon and item that can serve a one if i live in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home but should it have to be like that of course not it would be nice if we do have to fear that other person might get it into their twist little mind to hurt u but currently we do have that option nor do i expect we will do you think it wise to sell gun like candy some state do no state do in any case there a limit to which the state may enforce it wisdom on me freedom in general be an unwise concept if you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be unwise then freedom become a meaningles concept if you believe it to have drivers-licence why do you think it should be free to buy gun i raise my hand against driver license a currently implement they a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the state and ignore by a startle number of driver it do not guarantee a level of skill any higher than be necessary to get ymy car on the road and get yourself or somebody else kill or a knowledge of traffic law beyond what any ten year old will have pick up rid around in hi parent car but a i mention they two different thing david veal univ of tenn div of cont education info service group i still remember the way you laugh the day ymy push me down the elevator shaft i begin to think you do love me anymore weird al
