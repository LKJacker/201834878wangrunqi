from tmh todd m helfter subject re revenge do anyone have any idea about the size of waco i just curiou because if it be a small town that may have something to do with it possibly not it sure do take it very long to burn down though i wa watch abc and it only take like a little over minute to burn down waco be a city of about person the population temporarily raise to about person when all the feed and state polouse officer arrive i tell you what i stay in a hotel room about mile from the bd compound around week ago i have never felt more paranoid in my whole life there be at least state polouse in the hotel the claim we have the water turn off so the fire engine have to bring their own do hold up if they have cut off the water they surely could have turn it back on just a quickly they just do want to there be some score to settle message to anybody else be very clear do fuck with u we will do you in not that i be one to believe that everything that the government tell u be true but if that wa the message they want to send why do they wait day i think the message would be better send by charge in there right away not wait for day and pound them with sound etc a bunch of dead bd member be not go to be so able to tell their side of the story so now all we have be the story accord to the batf and fbi also mr care about the right of person clinton or hi administration approve thi action fbi say have approve it they fbi say the ga mask use by the bd have a finite life and be close to run out why could they have just waited well there be person supposedly alive they can tell their story a far a bill clinton be concern do you think he ha more press matter to attend to beside some small group of person in texa how about bosnium now there a problem why could they have wait they wait too long a it be something should have be do earlier they gov be try to say it wa a ma suicide in the past they have express thi wa a real possibility but now they decide it wa a possibility so they could go on with the raid apparantly what they feel korash wa or wa not capable of or go to do wa drive by what wa most convenient at the time now thi mean that the public and medium will forget about all thi have become weary of it thi ha already happen for many person there will be no investigation independent or otherwise or a whitewash very much a possibility there will be no unseal of the warrant and relate document what anybody will know about thi incident will be the batf version with the way my government be i would doubt it the batf ha just be give carte blanche for further bus with the effective support and approval of the administration clinton say on the news that he know about what wa happen but that it wa all in the hand of the fbi that be if you choose to believe the medium there will be more bus with no concern of administration censure the precident ha be establish that the fed can kill in quantity to achieve their aim especially if the target be excercising their right under the second amendment and the rest of the bill of right and be a government-declared un-nice fellow if they have rocket launcher and such a the pres and gov claim why should they have do something what possible use would a religiou cult have for a rocket launcher also be child abuse cover by the bill of right ll and clam will be please dung tsow ping sp will be please saddam hussein sp will be please idi amin would be please stalin would be please even hitler would be please any self-respecting despot would nod and say well done bill clinton well then there be probably a lot of self-respecting despot in the u cause i sure they feel the same way god bles america land of the free past tense well maybe i am overreact but i see on the tv a i be type where maybe maybe not there be a lot of question that should be raise about thi incident the problem be who will do it and be hear govt spoksewoman the new attorney general know to be almost rabid about private ownership of gun want to ban gun and just about everything else be say the fbi have amaze restraint then fall back into the official goverenment line about how the bd be guity of child abuse and be into it in an on-going basi and so on note that accord to the liberal elite give a child a spank be regard a child abuse seriously if it get know the state can take ymy child away from you if you spank ymy kid she also be say which state be that the federal government or an individual state government clinton personally approved thi operation she tell him it wa appropriate and so on and he said ok do it somehow i be not surprise the person must know who is bos who is in charge and it be obviouly no longer the person it seem to me that the person have be in charge for a long time if they really be i do think the government would be do a many thing a it ha in the past and i maintain the appropriate response a far a thi raid by batf be concern regard child abuse be so what batf be not my child protective service polouse yet after all the bd have be tried on that charge before and find not guilty the person have pretty much go silent on the terrible illegal gun bd supposedly ha and stres the continue child abuse apparantly to make it a seem a sort of a operation figure everyone hate child abuser and anything be ok to use against them occasional reference to ammunition possesed by the bd and so on be irrelevant it be not illegal to have ammunition yet true but be it illegal to have a rocket launcher am i have a vain hope that an honest investigation will occur on thi thing or will it simply be whitewash under the rug and busines a usual will continue to be the order of the day in the new order who will be give the official title of thought polouse i wonder and if clinton and friend have their way highly likely at thi point the new order government will also have all the gun so what if be go to be ten year late i think we be go to discover that we will be pay dearly for put thi fellow in office for decade to come even some die-hard supporter be have seriou doubt about their savior shit if person dont get what they want right away there be an instant problem clinton ha only be in office for a few month give him a chance to get something do the guy have a lot of shit throw in hi lap in the begin give him a chance to work on thing a little a they say rome wa build in a day ye i be upset i see no good a far a right to come of any of hi for the last month or so we have really be had or bill of right be now nothing but a quaint curiosity i highly doubt that it be that bad yet how about the rodney king trial the two person who be most responsible get the axe how bad the axe fall tho be yet to be see anybody for impeachment nope i would prefer to give bill a little more than fmy or five month to solve the nation problem pat without prejudice ucc pat myrto seattle wa if all else fail try uunet pilchuck rwing pat wisdom only two thing be infinite the universe and human stupidity and i be not sure about the former albert einstien jason
