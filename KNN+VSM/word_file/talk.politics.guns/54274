rally in the seclude courtyard behind the statehouse at it wa look sparse about person until the speaker begin whereupon about more person follow the loudspeaker from wherever they have be lose and fill out the area something proud mike yacino of goal speak one of hi best throwaway line wa to remind u that all of u holder of carry permit there have be check and certify clear of all crime by the

a bill to ban all sale of firearm or ammo to anyone who be not a state resident the hear be originally schedule in the large gardner auditorium at but that have be pre-empted by the governor hear on the framingham eight woman in prison for kill abusive husband and seek release so we have until to buttonhole my representative after which we would be squash into an inadequate hear room one of my representative staffer wa somewhat offensively smarmy he say oh it must be gun hear day again the gun lobby be alway so organize every year i get a little piss and reply i not from the gun lobby i from ymy district at ymy second reporter arrive in time to notice a demonstration go on in front of the statehouse where the pro-gunner be randy price from the tv news wa there in hi mirror reflective shade talk to one of the anti-gun type and several simon rock anti-gun close-the-loophole protestor earlier randy have cover the goal rally the room we have be assign seat about remember there be about gun owner there plu another student and teacher from bard one of u have already reserve a seat the other never get closer than the atrium outside and there wa a crowd behind him a cop take up station at the entrance and prevent the rest of the crowd from come in soon after the debate start a loudspeaker wa set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else everyone who wa there inside and outside get to sign up on a sheet say what their position wa on which bill most of u sign up to support goal position on all bill first because of their time constraint public official get to testify and first up wa the bill that nobody have see the student have some curfew i gues currently massachusett law allow a non-resident to purchase long gun or ammo from a local dealer provide he comply with the law of hi own state previously the law wa similar but apply only to non-resident from state adjoin massachusett the simon rock folk call the current law a loophole and want it close two of their rep speak about wayne lo and hi sk assault rifle the second one hodgekis a co-sponsor have do hi homework so well that he keep confuse montana wayne lo home state with missourus and become belligerent when about five gun owner in the gallery correct him after hi second muff carr from gloucester claim that the new bill would put the law back the way it wa but he wa lie the new bill allow purchase by non-resident of adjoin state only if they have license in their own state a strong a that in massachusett since none of them do that that some of the thing these two say be really offensive in some of these other state anyone can buy a gun a long a he breathe oooooo we have some very very good gun law in massachusett if only the other state would adopt the same type of law we would be have thi situation but they wo naughty naughty next up wa boston city councilman albert dapper he wa there to testify pro-gun but in some way he wa a liability he reasonably elderly and tend to wander and repeat himself plu he almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician he badmouth the aclu say violent criminal should be execute and that if he be judge he give arrestee their last right pun intend on the spot at which many of the gun owner applaud which bother me he say that all the propose gun restriction be a step in the right direction for the criminal he say thi fmy time two of the bill under consideration would allow polouse to rescind a ccw or fid and confiscate all ymy gun if someone have file a restrain order against you note that the file of a restrain order require no warrant no hear no evidence and no conviction just an accusation senator barrett of reading testify in favor of it and patronize the pro-gunner there several time by say i sure all the gun owner here will agree with me that we have to get these weapon out of the hand of person that my court have convict i have see such a disgustingly disingenuou performance since nixon whine that he wa a crook barrett also speak in favor of the bill make the fid card renewable every five year instead of permanent a it be now the state purpose be to remove fid card from those who have become ineligible revenue ha nothing to do with it yeah right apparently some congressman think we stupid enough to swallow the argument that it preferable to proces million renewal every cycle in the vague hope of catch a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time a usual hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook the two co-chair of the committee be rep caron and sen jujuga jujuga do say much he wa a co-sponsor of both restrain order bill but caron strike me a a sharp guy that would let any bad logic or ly on the part of either side to go unchallenged he wa a co-sponsor of one of the restrain order bill a well one of the younger rep on the committee forget hi name wa vociferously pro-gun somewhat embarrassingly so hi heart wa in the right place but hi argument seem to be confine to every year it the same damn thing you come in here with thi crap it nice to have a friend on the committee but he could have be more effective at about it wa clear that the hall-jam could continue someone come out of another meet hall and yell at the cop because the loudspeaker wa disturb their meet so the loudspeaker wa disconnect so they find a bigger hall upstair one of u have to leave to catch hi charter bu and so miss the public testimony the other get a seat thi time caron begin by talk about how he get hi fid year ago leave the state and then return without notify them of hi addres change he complain that the state record system wa not up-to-date and that hi pd back in hi city of birth still think he live there great quote if you purchase a gun today it will not get into the state computer system until thi wa also an argument he use against the renewable fid card testimony wa hear from several batter woman one of whom have be attack by some guy in hi who have an fid card because he get it when he wa or thereabout they use a lot of emotion and say how they be scar of these man a staffer of attorney general harshbarger testify in favor of thi anti-gun bill say how restrain order be grant last year and how these woman need to be protect caron note that a restrain order wa grant for day and then a hear wa hold to determine whether the order would be extend to a year he ask whether she would be satisfy if the fid be revoke at the time of thi hear rather than after the initial issuance of the fid she give some long ramble circumlocution in response then testimony against the bill wa hear mike yacino who look something like einstein get up and make the point that restrain order be issue on too little evidence that judge like to issue restrain order just to let thing cool off no matter who they think be right man or woman and that the hear for restrain order be lightning session with little time to consider fact atty karen mcnutt speak with him a few time during hi testimony other pro-gunner get up to testify one say he have have to file a restrain order against a tenant to clear her out and that she counter by file one against him he note that thi would have allow the state to confiscate hi gun if the new bill become law one of the junior rep note that thi be america and we have to be certain that individual right be respect senator jujuga reiterate thi say that person who abuse smaller person can go to hell a far a i care but we have to be careful about equate conviction with a restrain order point and match senator another pro-gunner get up and testify that he do know hi citizenship expire every year and that a driver license wa a privilege not a right like the right to keep and bear arm a third get up and say the problem wa with the criminal justice system and argue in favor of a death penalty bill and public hang senator jujuga say he have himself try to get a death penalty bill pass and joke respond that he too favor public hang the speaker then respond i make you a deal you get me the rope and i tie the noose next come public testimony on the simon rock bill a teacher testify that she have be the teacher of wayne lo and that he would have be able to shoot person inside a build while he wa outside without hi evil gun she say that the loophole should be close to prevent something like thi from ever happen again fmy or five other kid testify in favor of thi bill one of spill tear for the good legislator one of the student actually shoot by wayne lo wa also there many of them have t shirt on say a long a one person can buy a gun in anger none of u be safe support gun control the committee wa reluctant to grill or correct the kid except for caron who correct one student who have claim that anyone could apply for an fid only resident can get fid he say how much do you want to bet that thi kid have no idea he have be con into testify for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off yacino and mcnutt speak again thi time note that the bill a write would affect both ammo and all gun possess by out-of-staters karen also note that hunter in ct nh and vt could be put away for a year if they wander acros the ma boundary somewhere in the wood and get challenge by game warden yacino underscore the fact that lo could have get an fid a a resident student and hell even an ccw a he have no criminal or mental record one junior rep wa upset that it would take ma resident longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters and think it wa elitist another caron say that we need the protection of prevent non-resident from buy without an fid because only two other state in the union have fid-type card so comply with all the law of one home state wa not enough one pro-gun speaker reply that thi resemble a mother watch her son in a march band and exclaim everyone out of step but johnny all the bard college person be file out a the pro-gun testimony for thi bill wa make and thu only pro-gunner be around when the other bill come under consideration the main bill remain and goal position be o and fmy other notify polouse chief so they can pull license when a holder be convict strongly support o require trigger lock on all handgun sell oppose o require trigger lock on all load firearm strongly oppose o allow every municipality to enact their own gun law oppose o fund bullet-proof vest for municipal polouse support o state constitutional amendment for the rkba support o several on polouse discretion in the issuance of fid card oppose o several alter non-resident license condition support o ban damn near all gun everywhere in the state gues some of these take only second to consider a the remain pro-gunner raise hand in unison either for or against them mike yacino note that beside the danger in screw with a trigger lock on a load gun that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry hi conceal handgun unles it be lock caron blow right through when he saw that we oppose it again he bring up the state archaic record capability and say thi would create hundred of different license system the session run late since it wa the last schedule hear it could not be adjourn until everyone who want to have testify it end at about cdt if you believe that i speak for my company or cdt write today for my special
