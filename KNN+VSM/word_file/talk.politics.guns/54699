from crphilli ron phillip subject waco question folk it time to start build some precise question to send to my federal elect official and to investigative reporter in my local tv radio and newprint medium ideally these question could be ask at any investigation into the batf and fbi participation at the waco fiasco in hope of be resolve and hopefully wake up the local news medium that they be not get the entire truth from the batf and fbi my list be up to that be really nag at my gut the list will probably grow what be the content of the original warrant now seal that the batf obtain it be reasonable to believe that illegal firearm ammunition could not be flush down the toilet therefore a no-knock raid could be rule out prior to the initial assault on the complex do a single batf agent and accompany witnes without a contingent of assault and news medium personnel attempt to knock on the door of the branch davidian complex and serve the warrant in a manner prescribe by law on the day of the initial assault on the complex batf agent be aware that several small child be inside the build in the ensue gun battle batf agent fire into a build know to contain child kill at least one two-year old child knowing child be present why do the batf have an alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than open fire and jeopardize the life of the child in the build the fbi spokesman state that paper evidence indicate that david koresh and member of the branch davidian possess over in firearm and ammunition did david koresh and the member of the branch davidian have a valid federal firearm license be they actively participate in the legal busines of firearm and ammunition and be any of the weapon they have illegally possess do thi paper evidence consist only of weapon purchase or do it include legally dispossess weapon after the original assault on the compound tragically fail a batf spokeswoman state we be outgunned yet tv newscast of video tape film at the time of the incident show batf agent arm with and rifle although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent body they also may have have and sk rifle what type s of firearm do the batf agent have immediate acces to at the scene of the original assault on the complex since there be no evidence to confirm anyone wa inside the complex involuntarily why do the fbi treat it a a hostage situation along the same line why do the fbi use psychological warfare technique include sensory overload sleep deprivation and other disruptive technique that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than use technique aim at place the complex occupant into a calmer frame of mind report indicate several of the child inside the complex be accompany by their mother since it be reasonable to expect these mother would have their child take away from them if they come out why do the fbi expect the mother to just walk out and surrender themself to the authority agent at the scene claim to have see member of the branch davidian set fire to the complex branch davidian member who survive the inferno claim the fire wa start when an armor vehicle punch through the wall and knock over a lantern which wa set on a table video tape of the incident do show an armor vehicle punch a hole in the wall and the fire erupt almost immediately from the same general location wa the source of the fire the same room where the armor vehicle penetrate fbi spokesman be voice the opinion that the david koresh and the member of the branch davidian commit ma suicide yet body be be discover throughout the house and other area within the build complex thi seem to be counter to any know ma suicide through history what evidence do the fbi have that a ma suicide pact exist fbi director session state that the massive fireball show on the video tape wa cause by the branch davidian ammunition powder cache explode yet the fireball seem to be more characteristic of the type create when compress ga or other highly volatile fuel source explode wa any evidence find which would indicate the branch davidian have an ammunition powder cache which explode to create thi fireball if so and if david koresh and member of the branch davidian be engage in the legal busines of firearm wa the amount determine to be excessively greater than one would expect for someone engage in such a legal busines it be rumor that one fbi agent wa extremely upset about critical news medium coverage and intentionally use an armor vehicle to crush a reporter car which have be leave at the compound is there any factual basi to thi rumor and if so what charge will be bring against the fbi agent who perform the act fbi director session state that during the final assault on the complex over shoot be fire at the vehicle on the video tape of the incident you can hear the drone of the armor vehicle engine yet there be no sound of the sharp report that one would expect to hear if shoot be fire also there be no indication of smoke muzzle flash appear from the window build or other structure in the video surely these should be evident if the branch davidian have fire on the armor vehicle finally the video tape do not show any indication of paint splatter spark or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the branch davidian have fire upon the vehicle do any of the armor vehicle which be bring in to pump tear ga into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to be hit by shoot from high-power rifle cs ga be consider to be a chemical warfare agent the united state ha sign international treaty which prevent the use of cs ga in warfare if the united state could not morally use cs ga against saddam hussein and hi troop why be it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizen of my own land on april fbi spokesman state that at least body discover in the complex have bullet wind to the head indicate they have be murder or have commit suicide on april the county coroner claim he know nothing about any body find with bullet wind to the head were any of the victim body find within the burn out complex have bullet wind to the head ron phillip crphilli senior customer engineer intergraph electronic east evelyn avenue voice mountain view ca fax
