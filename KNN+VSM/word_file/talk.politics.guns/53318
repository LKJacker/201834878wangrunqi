from fcrary frank crary subject re gun control wa re we mad a hell at the tv news in article mane steve mane write on the other hand we can draw lesson from neighbor who be more culturally similar namely the canadian i do think such a canada be any more culturally similar to the united state than england in term of law regard individual right restriction on polouse search etc all closely relate to crime canadian law parallel england and differ greatly from those of the united state in fact an exhaustive seven-year study ha already be do of the respective crime rate of vancouver british columbium and seattle washington city with roughly the same population urban economy geography and crime but with decidedly different approach to gun control actually they do not have roughly the same urban economy and extremely different ethnic composition over the seven-year study homicide occur in seattle per v homicide in vancouver per after adjustment for difference in age and sex among the population the relative risk of be a victim of homicide in seattle a compare to vancouver wa find to be however if you account for economic and ethnic difference the difference disappear completely seattle minority be predominatly poor while vancouver be middle or upper clas the rate for white in both city be find to be identicle while the rate for poor seattle minority wa almost three time a great a for the well-to-do minority of vancouver the pattern seem to be one of poverty and race relation not one of gun control the author of the report also investigate legally justifiable homicide self-defense only such homicide occur during the seven-year study of which be commit by polouse only case of civilian act in self-defense occurrred that be a gros distortion self-defense do not mean kill the attacker there be case of civilian kill their attacker in self-defence but such case represent le that of the crime prevent by arm self-defence for every case you cite there be over other case of self-defence where the crime wa prevent but the attacker wa not kill by the way be the most conservative possible figure base on the national crime survey estimate of crime prevent by arm self-defence each year most other study on the subject put the figure at to those figure would imply le than of sucessful self-defence involve kill the attacker so more correctly there over possibly a many a case of civilian act in self-defence only of which result in the death of the attacker thi be a significant factor in comparison to the homicide if memory serve homicide make up approximately of the violent crime the study consider so the fair comparison would be homicide prevent and homicide clearly the study can not be close to accurate since it ignore these case of self-defence frank crary cu boulder
