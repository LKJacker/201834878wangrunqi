from rat morri the cat subject re my gun be like my american expres card what seem to be happen here be the situation get totally blow out of proportion in my post i wa refer to ymy regular patrolman in a car cruise around the city v gang member of course the polouse have acces to the thing that you mention but do they use tank and such all of the time of course they do and that the point i wa try to make every day when i go out to lunch i alway see cop come in the majority that i see be still carry revolver not that there be anything wrong with a revolver but if you a cop that be up against some gang member with a couple of automatic in hi coat i mean semi-auto handgun you go to be at a disadvantage even with train i have be at a shoot range where gang gang member be practice shoot they be actually practice take out their gun a quick a possible and shoot at the target and they be do too badly either the university cop here who be be state cop be arm better than the chicago polouse it seem most state cop be i do know where you be originally from david but you live in tennesse and i live in chicago and see thi crap everyday on the news and in the paper i think the situation be just a tad different here than there however do forget that the polouse in chicago can carry just about anything they want except for the glock which be not approve for carry gues they figure all cop be like the polouse chief of winnetka who happen to let off a stray round of thi be the same anti-gun polouse chief that want full-auto uzi for hi patrol car perhap in the judgement of the majority of chicago finest a close-to reliable weapon like a revolver be preferable to a reliable automatic i note that in germany where certainly the semi-auto handgun be king some of the more elite polouse type want revolver i do think the issue be cost because chicago polouse certainly make on the order of at least ymy presumption of disadvantage i think be not bear out by the experience of new york city cop there the cop usually come out on top with their standard spl revolver i see s ws ruger and berettum in addition to the revolver carry by chicago cop in the past i see other have see browning hi-power jason
