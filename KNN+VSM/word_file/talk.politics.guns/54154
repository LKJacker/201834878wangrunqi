from bressler rick bressler subject re proper gun control what be proper gun control wa re my gun be like my american expres card iftccu mikey strider pm apr i think most of u would rather be hold up with a knife than with a gun but how the hell are you going to manage that you still have offer i be watch thi knife verse gun bite for a while now even contribute a few comment but thi stuff i rather face a knife than a gun ha got to come from ignorance i use to think pretty much the same thing then i get person do not a a rule understand how deadly knife can be or how quickly you can be kill with one most person do understand that it take le than an inch of penetration in some area to cause quick within a minute or so death the death rate from handgun and knife be within a few percentage point of each other many person not realize how deadly knife be their luck and thu more get injure by knife a gun be deadly only in a single direction and it only advantage be that it be a remote control weapon a contact weapon such a a knife control a spherical area to foot in diameter most person have never see knife wind aside from slice a finger by accident from foot or so a knife be very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experience hand even if the knife wielder ha only moderate skill from inside foot or so a knife be a match for a drawn gun a knife be utterly silent it never jam and never run out of ammunition it be limit only by the speed dexterity skill and ability of it wielder criminal in general be young fast and strong it interest to note that the pattern slash attack use by many martial artist remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slash attack of novice i talk to several well train martial artist they have unanimously agree that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on be cut hopefully not a bad a the attacker practicing with firearm require facility and equipment practicing with knife require only a small area and something to simulate a knife say a popsicle stick or tooth brush criminal practice their knife attack in prison if you have not train against knife with a firearm and do not realize these fact the first inkling you will have that something be wrong be the knife rip through ymy throat or in the case of an experience attacker part of ymy body fall off onto the grind a year old man with arthritis can close that yard distance and gut you in about one and a half second denni tueller with a break leg in a walk cast manage it in two i see person close that distance and strike in second i old over weight and slow i can do it in second i see morgue footage of person kill with edge weapon that you would not believe how about a single stab wind to the chest with a table fork in thi case the attacker use the handle not the point end add to thi the that hand gun power be largely a myth except in the case of a central nervou system shoot or a round that destroy the skeletal structure it take anywhere from to twelve second for a bullet wind to effect thi be true of even heart shoot there be the case of the polouse woman in the first record survivor of a shoot to the heart that lady not only kill her attacker but chase him down to do it all fmy of her shoot fire after she have be shoot strike the perp attum girl the bullet enter her on a downward angle go through the apex of her heart down through the diaphragm clip her liver and destroy her spleen it then exit her back leave a tenni ball size hole she die about six time on the operate table but wa out of the hospital in day and wa back on full duty in eight month she wa off duty at the time and not wear her vest she wa on her way home so happen to have her gun no she do think civilian should have the same right sigh the moral of the story be that even if you do manage to shoot a knife attacker you better be plan on do some dodge a good alternative be to shoot for and break the pelvi person can often walk a little on break leg but a break pelvi will nearly alway anchor them many firearm school recommend pelvi shoot against contact weapon the target be a large a the traditional of ma and be more reliable to stop somebody with a contact weapon assume a caliber powerful enough to the job hot on up will usually do thi remember folk the idea be to em with you but for you to live and them to fail whatever the consequence for them thi the reason them be my goal or in many case even good enough to keep u alive i do want to face a violent attack of any sort knowing what i now know i ca rightly say i rather face a knife than an gun it would have to depend on the attacker and if i could pick and choose i would be there thi be really the bottom line criminal do not fear the law criminal do not fear the weapon they fear the citizen behind the weapon that ha show the resolution and determination to do whatever it take rick
