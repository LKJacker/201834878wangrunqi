from viking dan sorenson subject re my gun be like my american expres card thoma parsli thomasp write observation from a naive norwegian yup you say it i admire such honesty gun be make to kill person not to shoot target or to have something more macho than stamp to collect fire an anschutz then come back and talk to u you let ignorance and possibly fear cloud ymy think either that or thi be smy grape because we beat you in the olympic shoot event funny you think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse it is more easy to someone with a gun than with a knife or a bat a in baseball precisely that make them the best method of defense for the citizenry not everybody ha the time to train with a gladiu you know but for some reason those who prey on other seem to have more free time to extend thi a bite further you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon getting in their face with a weapon and win be much more difficult and require more train time the average citizen just do not have i spend a few year practice with a sword i can take the common person arm with one though self-defense be the reason i own one my kid sister would have an even chance of beat me gun v gun with only a month of train that make firearm much better in my eye it not very wise to compare two completely different country like usa and let say island on issue like crime and violence excellent point perhap you be so naive after all ye the problem be person commit crime not the tool beeing use but should be take into concideration taken into consideration in what respect though quite wrong let make it a blanket statement for weapon in general thi ha be take into consideration we call use of them aggrivated assault assault with a deadly weapon assault with intent to kill attempt murder and a whole host of other and tack on extra prison time we have a very strict gun-legislation in norway but until recently it wa possible for enyone over year to buy a shotgun shotgun be use mainly for hunt in norway but because it wa so easy to accuire one it wa the most use gun in crime in norway i suspect it wa about the only weapon available you conquer ymy land among other a full millenium before we be think of and shortly thereafter weapon be quite so common i suspect that a few world war make a difference too since in time of emergency weapon tend to be turn in or donate to needy cause i curiou though be the weapon use in the crime buy shortly before the crime or be they aquired by other mean any requirement other than just register the shotgun and unbelievable the use of gun in crime fell there be now a new law against wear long knife in public and why should it be allow come on down to honest erik used sword here a slightly-used short sword the battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century only with trade-in easy finance sorry i could resist you guy still slice each other with long knife or be thi really not a problem what i a an scandinavian have problem to understand be that you american have a more liberal view on gun and violence than on nudity and sex try show a bare breast on tv insted of violence and murder i all for that what get me be that scandanavian and ye i only a couple generation off the longship use to be some of the most fear warrior on the planet a mere millenium ago yet now seem to spend their time sit in spa and do a bite of toples sunbathe maybe you have a bite more time and a more homogeneou culture to become civilize with ye i know a little american history but be it a right to have an assault gun in ymy home an handgun in ymy car ye we too damn violent partially i believe because we be not a homogeneou culture and do identify ourself a american first and foremost i rather proud of my norwegian and danish heritage wherea i suspect you could care le about that welsh blood in ymy vein thank to a raid in ireland back in the time scale and the homogeneou culture be important equally important be a basic philosophical difference in personal versu collective good in america the individual be more important than the mass personal liberty be prize above all thi be sadly change of late but i trust you notice how thi call for freedom make law that restrict individual for little collective benefit hateful to american i hazard a gues that be america le interest in freedom and personal liberty and more interest in collective good we never would have send my arm force anywhere one poor effect of thi culture we have be that we look out for ourself and it be quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population my grandmother tell of be discriminate against back in denmark because she speak low dane wherea other speak high dane it wa shortly after world war ius a i remember that low dane wa abolish so there wa one common dialect we can not fathom such a minor thing be a problem because we have even more obviou mean of identify an outsider the bad english be not my fault it probably the keyboard-software or the quality of the subtext on tv take heart your be better than of what get post by native speaker any helpful hint for my educational system person have thi annoy tendency to drop out of school and sell drug over here and what kind of name be thoma parsli here you can use my great grandfather before he change it christian aarskog
