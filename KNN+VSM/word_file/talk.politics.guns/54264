from steven b syck subject re do knock the glock wa re my gun be like my am ex card in article jason kratz write all very true i go on what i have read and hear from friend basically the glock be great but i have that it be a lot harder to learn proper handle because of the type of safety that it ha i wa look at a glock w and the s w a couple of week ago and the safty on the gun be very different the saftey on the seem a lot more safe for lack of a better word than the one on the glock of course thi could also be a bad thing if you be to pull the gun on somebody you would spend more time fiddle around turn the safety off personally i like the glock because they be very light and i think they look really cool gues that why they use them in so many movie but i would get one a my first semi-auto because of the safety i would prefer more train with a traditional semi-auto ala colt but of course that just my opinion jason at the risk of start the gun be better than your flame war i must disagree there be no secret in handle a glock in fact it be often choose beside it other merit because it shoot like a revolver do basically it can limit the train time read budget due to the fact there be no safty other than the trigger hence le train time require smith wesson among other type be choose due to the fact taht they do have the external safty hammer drop a well a mag drop which if properly use have save many life when bad snatch the gun from the officer and try to shoot say officer the gun wa on safe and would not fire thi point have be make in many article in variou gun magazine if fact one author ca remember who stag a little test where he have a revolver and a s w on safe lay on a table and ask person with little firearm experience to on hi signal grab the gun and shoot a target he time the person use each gun the revolver time be pretty close but some of the time with the s w be in minute or the person just give up because they could not figure out the saftey you do often see colt auto issue due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fire in a stres situation open the issue city county etc to lawsuit bad pres etc of course any problem can be overcome with enough train but such train be not alway available to budget crunch department i know if i be a cop i would want something like a s w just for the off chance of the gun get take away the safety do guarantee that bad wo figure it out and shoot me but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot bad before it too late do think i be too bias here just because i have have glock in my possession at one time because i have have a a well in fact it wa my first handgun remember the ultimate be you the operator and no safety be go to stop an negligent discharge note i do say accidental if you break the rule of gun handle a per the part of be light weight and look cool i agree i would rule it out a a first purchase just my tax steve syck
