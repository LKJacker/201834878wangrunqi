from mane steve mane subject re gun control wa re we mad a hell at the tv news jim de arra jmd write last year the u suffer almost wrongful or accidental death by handgun alone fbi statistic in the same year the uk suffer such death scotland yard statistic the population of the uk be about that of the u weighted for population the u ha a many handgun-related death a the uk and no the brit do make up for thi by murder a many person with baseball bat you just ca compare thi way all homicide must be show per capitum not just handgun the availability of them in the usa make them the prefer murder weapon but ban them and some other weapon will step in a the favorite a a favorite sure a lethal not likely a study of violence in chicago produce thi table percentage of reported gun and knife attack resulting in death weapon death a percentage of attack knife total attack gun total attack source firearm and violence in american life it might be contend that if gun murderer be deprive of gun that they would find a way to kill a often with knife if thi be so knife attack in city where gun be widely use in homicide would be expect to show a low fatality rate and knife attack in city where gun be not so widely use like vancouver would show a higher fatality rate but the commission on the cause and prevention of violence task force analyze the datum and find thi not to be the case it appear to them that a the number of knife attack increase in relation to the number of firearm attack which presumably happen where gun be le available to assailant the proportion of fatal knife attack do not increase relative to the proportion of gun attack in fact the reverse wa true what wa find wa that most homicide do not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill fatality cause by knife tend to show a single-mindednes on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury multiple stab wind wind concentrate about the head neck and chest etc most gun homicide do not show thi pattern rather more fatal attack be commit during a moment of rage and not the focus intent to kill the victim source report on firearm and violence then since england usa my ancestor leave because of the oppression you must compare england before strict gun law to england after strict gun law to be able to draw any mean at all england ha essentially legalize drug so there be no drug gang battle for turf etc there if you drop out the drug relate kill here the usa would look a whole lot more peaceful there be a lot of factor which make a difference actually i not fond of make any kind of social parallel between european and american there be more cultural beahvioral and economic difference between u than similarity i just sort of find myself back into that corner over the last couple of week i do think we could ever attain the low level of european violent crime here in the u whether we ban gun or require every law-abiding citizen to carry a load uzi on the other hand we can draw lesson from neighbor who be more culturally similar namely the canadian in fact an exhaustive seven-year study ha already be do of the respective crime rate of vancouver british columbium and seattle washington city with roughly the same population urban economy geography and crime but with decidedly different approach to gun control in seattle handgun may be purchase legally for self-defense after a wait period a permit can be obtain to carry a conceal weapon the recreational use of handgun be minimally restrict in vancouver self-defense be not consider a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun concealed weapon be not permit recreational use of handgun target shoot collect be regulate by the province purchase of a handgun require a restricted-weapon permit a permit to carry may be obtain in order to transport the weapon to license shoot club handgun transport by vehicle must be store in the trunk in a lock box in short gun control but not unreasonably so both city aggressively enforce their gun law conviction for gun-related offense carry similar penalty the researcher study all case of robbery assault simple and aggravate burglary and homicide occur in seattle and vancouver from to in define the case they use the same standard the fbi unified crime report result during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in seattle wa find to be only slightly higher than that in vancouver burglary occur at nearly identical rate assault be record in seattle versu in vancouver the risk of be a victim of a simple assault in seattle wa find to be only slightly higher than vancouver and the risk of aggravate assault wa also slightly higher however when aggravate assault be subdivide by weapon and the mechanism of assault a clear pattern emerge although both city report nearly identical rate of aggravate assault involve knife and other dangerou weapon firearm be far more likely to be use in seattle in fact time a often over the seven-year study homicide occur in seattle per v homicide in vancouver per after adjustment for difference in age and sex among the population the relative risk of be a victim of homicide in seattle a compare to vancouver wa find to be when homicide be subdivide by the mechanism of death the rate of homicide by knife and other weapon exclude firearm in seattle wa find to be almost identical to that in vancouver virtually all of the increase risk of death in seattle wa due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearm handgun account for roughly of homicide involve firearm handgun be time more likely to be use in homicide in seattle than in vancouver the author of the report also investigate legally justifiable homicide self-defense only such homicide occur during the seven-year study of which be commit by polouse only case of civilian act in self-defense occurrred in seattle and in vancouver only involve firearm after exclude these case there wa virtually no impact on these earlier find thi be i feel a very fair report one might even make the argument that it be bias against canada a a whole because vancouver report annual rate of homicide two to three time that of ottawa calgary and toronto while seattle report annual homicide rate only half to two-third that of nyc chicago lo angele and houston critic of handgun control alway argue that limit legal acces to handgun will have little effect on the rate of homicide because person intent on kill other will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other mean thi report show differently if the rate of homicide in a community be influence more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapon we could expect the rate of homicide by weapon other than gun to be higher in vancouver than in seattle however during the study interval vancouver rate of homicide by weapon other than gun wa not significantly higher than that in seattle suggest that few would-be assailant switch to homicide by other method a well ready acces to handgun for self-defense by law-abiding citizen wa not endorse in thi report although seattle do experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense these case account for le than of the homicide in both city during the course of the study period and a wa report seattle apparently do enjoy relief from any crime category over vancouver because citizen may legally arm themself for self-defense heavily quote source handgun regulation crime assault and homicide a tale of two city john h sloan arthur l kellerman donald t reay jame a ferri thoma
