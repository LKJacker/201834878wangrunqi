from viking dan sorenson subject re rewording the second amendment idea dfo foxvog dougla write viking dan sorenson write that really depend upon where you draw the line while define these weapon thi mean you would support a ban if it be narrow enough good very narrow very very narrow if you recall i wa the nut that advocate the possibility of tactical nuke be militium weapon in certain situation how can you possibly define what be a weapon and what be be only the start of thi and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of modern practice five month or five century down the road i would hope so let define a nuclear weapon a an explosive weapon whose majority of energy come from fission fusion of atomic nucleus and you just describe any civilian reactor because ymy definition fail to note what energy be be consider reactor blow with a steam explosion but the majority of energy still come from fission or fusion because that be what heat the coolant see what a can of worm thi be last i hear ft calhoun station just north of omaha nebraska wa consider a weapon given the sodium-cooled breeder design on the block now i can easily envision reactor be household appliance in under twenty year with the prism design there be no operator input need on the reactor itself and it be not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be make equally a automatic in the future so ymy definition be flaw in a few respect already let define a biological weapon a live organism or viruse in such state quantity and with such a vector that they could cause death or seriou disease further define to a significant number of person if release in a city similarly populate area resevoir or cropland typhoid mary would likely fit thi bill if she sneeze if you do mind extrapolation any hiv-positive person also fit thi bill if they interact with other in a way that stand any chance of spread the viru finally that manure pile i mention below fit thi definition a do say release a pet rattlesnake to the wild nerve ga and mustard ga be well define other poisonou gas should be individually ban only if it can be show that there be no use not relate to weaponry license should be available for research purpose on such chemical and i can show where any such ga ha other use for example perhap we would like to rid the hay field of gopher calcium carbide be a rock that dissolf in water to produce aceteylne ga it can be use for weld in miner lamp for gas gopher or for make carbide bomb and do some illicit fish tos some in a toilet and leave a light cigarette on the seat and you see that it can also be a weapon just like any other flammable substance so now my miner lamp wo work i ca do any weld and i still have those pesky gopher i be not a lawyer but these idea could certainly be a basi for definition the basi for but i sure you see that the problem be not in write a law it be in write a law that can not be abuse and extend beyond the point where it do any good i give you a little hint see that manure pile in the farmer field down the road in the usa that be a weapon of ma destruction nope it be not consider a weapon it be under ymy propose law so be a silage pit if there be run-off so be underground fuel tank biological in nature because if it get wash into an open well it will contaminate the aquifer that supply thousand of city with drink water so where do you draw the line in the usa the epa ha rule that a pile of scrap iron be illegal care to draw a thinner line thi time it be not define a a weapon of ma destruction many thing be ban for other reason it meet all the criterion of a weapon it be an instrument that can be use for fight even though that be not it intend purpose and despite there be better weapon around given that the aquifer supply a significant part of the country with drink water ma destruction be rather a give it not that certain weapon be something i rather not see a lot of person have the problem be that it be nearly impossible to write a law such that it can not be abuse upon some pretext or another the looser ymy definition the more ripe for abuse that law be furthermore if you get specific then the old standby be to insert a clause allow the list of ban thing to be add to generally without go through the hassle of another vote and public read of the law again ripe for abuse dan sorenson dod viking isu only censor what i read not what i say do blame them usenet post to exotic distant machine meet excite unusual person and flame them
