from meyer bill meyer subject re clipper chip in article paul eric stoufflet write i think that the clipper chip that wa post to sorry i lose the original post wa a joke i really do i do believe it for a second but on the way to work thi morning i hear about it on npr no joke here another copy for you to save npr hmmm did they mention the part about the fact of law enforcement acces to the escrowed key will not be conceal from the american public newsgroup path dg-rtp psinntp uunet decwrl blh from blh broward l horne message-id subject heil clinton date sun apr mdt x-received by id mon apr x-received by id mon apr x-received by id sun apr x-to x-mailer elm revision line although the subject matter of thi re-posting be not directly relate to i believe that the information here will be of interest to a large number of reader especially consider my latest batf escapade from clipper clipper chip announcement subject white house public encryption management fact sheet message-id sender news organization national institute of standard technology distribution na date frus apr gmt line note the follow wa release by the white house today in conjunction with the announcement of the clipper chip encryption technology fact sheet public encryption management the president ha approve a directive on public encryption management the directive provide for the follow advanced telecommunication and commercially available encryption be part of a wave of new computer and communication technology encryption product scramble information to protect the privacy of communication and datum by prevent unauthorized acces advanced telecommunication system use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communication these advance telecommunication system be integral to the infrastructure need to ensure economic competitivenes in the information age despite it benefit new communication technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance sophisticated encryption can have thi effect in the united state when export abroad it can be use to thwart foreign intelligence activity critical to my national interest in the past it ha be possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interest while at the same time protect the privacy and civil liberty of all citizen a encryption technology improve do so will require new innovative approach in the area of communication encryption the u s government ha develop a microcircuit that not only provide privacy through encryption that be substantially more robust than the current government standard but also permit escrowing of the key need to unlock the encryption the system for the escrowing of key will allow the government to gain acces to encrypt information only with appropriate legal authorization to assist law enforcement and other government agency to collect and decrypt under legal authority electronically transmit information i hereby direct the follow action to be take installation of government-developed microcircuit the attorney general of the united state or her representative shall request manufacturer of communication hardware which incorporate encryption to install the government-developed key-escrow microcircuit in their product the fact of law enforcement acces to the escrowed key will not be conceal from the american public all appropriate step shall be take to ensure that any exist or future version of the key-escrow microcircuit be make widely available to communication hardware manufacturer consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system in make thi decision i do not intend to prevent the private sector from develop or the government from approve other microcircuit or algorithm that be equally effective in assure both privacy and a secure key escrow system key-escrow the attorney general shall make all arrangement with appropriate entity to hold the key for the key-escrow microcircuit instal in communication equipment in each case the key holder must agree to strict security procedure to prevent unauthorized release of the key the key shall be release only to government agency that have establish their authority to acquire the content of those communication that have be encrypt by device contain the microcircuit the attorney general shall review for legal sufficiency the procedure by which an agency establish it authority to acquire the content of such communication procurement and use of encryption device the secretary of commerce in consultation with other appropriate agency shall initiate a proces to write standard to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption device fit with key-escrow microcircuit in federal communication system that proces sensitive but unclassified information i expect thi proces to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six month of thi directive the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption device to the extent need to preserve the government ability to conduct lawful electronic
