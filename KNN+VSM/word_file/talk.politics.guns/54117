from cathy cathy smith subject letter to a liberal colleague l neil smith posted by cathy smith for l neil smith letter to a liberal colleague author note adrian name change to protect the guilty and the author be science fiction novelist who once work with the same editor at a famou new york publish house dear adrian i way behind schedule on my current book again so thi reply to ymy note criticize the recent magazine interview i give and generally attack gun ownership will necessarily consist mostly of assertion you free to believe or not i can back with evidence and logic i neither time nor energy to present now i write fully on thi topic before and will again in the future when i do i make sure you get copy there be many argument i might make from the futility and danger of delegate self-defense to the polouse see don kate in the jan wall street journal to the real effect of prohibition shift consumer from newly-outlawed handgun or semiautomatic rifle to item like sawed-off shotgun or homemade bomb but i limit myself here to comment on the newspaper clip you send with ymy note first the freedom to own and carry the weapon of ymy choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic proces nor to argument ground in social utility second publication of some latter-day scientific study do alter the fact that the gun prohibitionist i discuss in my interview annoy you so much in the proces be lie third the freedom to own and carry the weapon of ymy choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic proces nor to argument ground in social utility fourth a often happen with these thing the study do support the gun prohibitionist original numerical contention anyway but simply add a new layer of spuriou claim to an older body of ly omission and distortion fifth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of ymy choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic proces nor to argument ground in social utility sixth the fact that gun prohibitionist have be catch lie on countles occasion carl bakal author of no right to keep and bear arm even confess to it publicly make the value of thi present study dubiou to say the least seventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of ymy choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic proces nor to argument ground in social utility eighth give ymy own lifelong service a a federal bureaucrat not to mention the cynical sophistication of ymy fiction you should be better aware than most person how progress in design study to prove whatever you want outstrip my ability to collect meaningful datum a case in point we might agree on be the fact that it take another kind of prohibitionist or year to create study prove that pornography cause crime more naive and probably more honest effort in the and clearly indicate the contrary ninth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of ymy choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic proces nor to argument ground in social utility tenth another reason to doubt all such study be that human behavior a the austrian school of economic demonstrate be far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantify the attempt to do so and then create public policy base on the result pseudo-information be wreck my civilization eleventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of ymy choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic proces nor to argument ground in social utility twelfth the study be also worthles because it incorporate figure for suicide which be not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right sometime with ancillary social benefit if anything perhap suicide intervention should be a criminal offense thirteenth and finally the national rifle association official quote in the article whatever their shortcoming and they be many be correct in thi instance the study be meaningles because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of ymy choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic proces nor to argument ground in social utility and because of that adrian even if the study be valid it would deter me from a lifelong personal objective of see that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefer and carry it however whenever and wherever he or she desire without ask anybody permission in thi i ably assist by gun prohibitionist themself whose yawp invariably move previously unarm person to go out and buy their first gun while they still can before the gun control act most of the shoot fraternity view handgun incorrectly a it turn out a inaccurate ineffective toy there probably be six million of them in the whole country now thank to kennedy metzenbaum the brady and their ilk america greatest sporting good sale team we probably manufacture at least that many every year the fascinate datum be that handgun control et al be perfectly aware of thi so i gues you have to ask them yourself what their real motive be look gun-making be an arcane or difficult art and by the way it easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic the fact that i can still obtain my own weapon of preference the self-loading pistol be the only thing which keep me from pursue thi further even if it be difficult there be already a quarter billion firearm in america with an estimate half life of year possibly more for stainles steel gun be gon na be around a long time adrian whether you like it or not a for me to paraphrase elmer keith regardles of what the law provide or any court decide i alway go to be arm and i will alway work to see that other be a well the bad news be that there be thousand more perhap even hundred of thousand where i come from we ca be stop by pass law we can only be force to arm ourself and other secretly and give both the practical and allege difference between full automatic and semiautomatic perhap more efficiently so what the point l neil smith author the probability broach the crystal empire henry martyn and forthcoming palla lever action bb fidonet libertarian second amendment caucu nra life member my opinion be of course my own
