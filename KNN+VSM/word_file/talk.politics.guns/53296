from rat morri the cat subject study critique open letter by dr paul h blackman research coordinator for nra-ila nra official journal dear sir by now we be use to the new england journal of medicine publication of small-scale study relate to firearm from which conclusion be draw which be quantum leap from the datum follow by announcement of momentu scientific find these be regularly release to the pres without the caveat which riddle the conclusory paragraph and often accompany by an editorial call attention to the find generally while they at least present a few interest datum however meaningles the study misinterpret statistic and ignore or belittle seriou study by criminologist the latest effort handgun regulation crime assault and homicide a tale of two city by sloan et al with the accompany editorial firearm injury a call for science by two employee of the center for disease control november however be an insult to the intelligence of any seriou scholar in any field and have so few datum and so many flaw that i feel compel to write at some length to call attention to variou major and minor fail in no particular order the author misleadingly cite wright et al ref to support the statement that some have argue that restrict acces to handgun could substantially reduce my annual rate of homicide wright et al in fact study and reject that contention the author pretend that vancouver and seattle be very similar city with similar economic circumstance history demographic characteristic and the like in fact the city be very different with very different demographic characteristic which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in seattle both city be over three-forth non-hispanic white and the non-hispanic white homicide rate be report to be the same in seattle and vancouver it be the different back grind problem circumstance and behavior of the variou ethnic minority which explain the difference in homicide the author pretend they be evaluate canada gun law compare to washington state but they do not examine at all the situation in vancouver prior to the gun law take effect in a it happen in the three year prior to that vancouver average homicide per year one-eighth involve handgun ref and in the seven year of the nejm article there be homicide per year one-eigth involve handgun surely even the medical profession recognize that one must look to see the prior situation wa before conclude that a change make a difference would a physician conclude that a patient wa benefit from eat oat bran muffin each day for seven year because hi cholesterol level wa without at least see if it wa before he start the regiman the author pick two medium-sized city to evaluate a national gun law nothing can be learn from such a tiny and arbitrarily select sample seattle appear to have be select because it wa convienient for the author rather than for any scientific reason would physician call something a scientific study which involve one experimental subject and one dissimilar control had different arbitrarily select city be choose opposite scientific conclusion would follow vancouver homicide rate exceed that of such wild west city in texa a el paso corpu christus austen and in colorado colorado spring ref the author fail to clearly demonstrate that firearm or handgun be far more commonly own in seattle than in vancouver they use two surrogate approach in pretend to study the availability of the first be an apples-and-orange effort to compare the number of carry permit in seattle to the number of register handgun in vancouver but the number clearly understate the number of handgun in seattle and count primarily protective handgun owner the second however tell nothing about the number of handgun in vancouver and count non-protective handgun for the most part where be it difficult to obtain handgun legally for protection registration figure be meaningles there be register handgun in new york city new york daily news sept comparing the two that method suggest about handgun per population in new york city compare to in vancouver mean vancouver ha a greater prevalence of weapon than new york city the second method of measure gun density be cook gun prevalence index a previously validate measure of intercity difference but the validation wa by cook of hi own theory ref normally second opinion be seek from a different doctor more significantly the cook index be base on the average of the percentage of firearm involvement in suicide and homicide so the author be basically take a measure of misuse unsurprisingly gun misuse in homicide in seattle in vancouver be relate to gun misuse in homicide plu suicide divide by two in seattle in vancouver the author be not measure the relative avail ability of firearm or of handgun in seattle and vancouver the author misstate the law of both washington and canada they neglect to mention the significant fact that washington ha a wait period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun and that provision exist in canadian law for own and carry handgun for personal protection the author also make it appear that it be more difficult to get a handgun legally in canada than be actually the case the author ignore all other factor which might explain the difference in crime rate beyond some vague mention of the penality provide by law and the roughest of estimate of clearence for one particular offense homicide involve a firearm there be no measure of the difference in the number of law enforcement officer their aggressivenes in make arrest for gun law violation in the two jurisdiction arrest rate for other offense conviction rate actual sentence impose for gun-related crime violent crime without gun or gun law violation or incarceration rate wherea social scientist would attempt to measure and hold for such difference the author of the nejm tale of two city fail even to mention most factor relate to crime control the author dismis claim that handgun be an effective mean for protection unles the criminal be kill such be not the case criminologist ref have find that almost american annually use handgun for protection from criminal and that use a gun for protection reduce the liklihood that a crime rape robbery assault will be complete by the criminal and reduce the likelihood of injury to the victim it be interest nonetheles that the author report the same number fmy of civilian justifiable homicide without firearm in each city but that le restrictive seattle account for of the report civilian justifiable homicide involve firearm the center for disease control which fund the study editorially praise the paper ref say it apply scientific method to examine a focu of contention betweeb advocate of stricter regulation of firearm particularly handgun there be nothing in the paper which could possibly be mistake for scientific method by a sociologist or criminologist the vancouver-seattle study be the equivolent of test an experimental drug to control hypertension by find two ordinary-looking middle-clas white male one age and the other and without first take their vital sign administer the experimental drug to the while give the a placebo then take their blood pressure and on find the younger man have a lower blood pressure announce in a special article a new medical breakthrough it would be nice to think that such a study would neither be fund by the cdc or print by the nejm since the longstanding anti-gun bias of the nejm and the cdc make them will to present shoddy research a scientific breakthrough in special article and editorial relate to firearm we be obligate to correct the record by notify the news medium and those with congressional and executive oversight over the activity of the center for disease control about the distortion contain in handgun regulation crime assault and homicide a tale of two city and firearm injury a call for science clearly all scientific standard go by the wayside whenever the cdc and the new england journal of medicine seize an opportunity to attack firearm ownership in america reference wright jd et al

the american society of criminology convention chicago mercy ja houk vn firearm injury a call for science nejm gun and sputter by jame d wright from july issue of reason free mind free market someone once write statistic be like a bikini what they real be suggestive but what they conceal be vital the problem be demonstrate by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purport to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide funded by the federal government and publish last year in the new england journal of medicine the study compare homicide rate in seattle and vancouver and suggest that a handgun ban may reduce the rate of homicide in a community the nine medical doctor who publish handgun regulation crime assault and homicide essentially reason in three step despite many historical social and demographic similarity vancouver ha a markedly lower homicide rate because it stricter gun regulation make gun le available the second step in their reason seem indisputable the overall homicide rate in seattle for the period wa per popuation compare with in vancouver homicide be definitely more common in seattle the question then become why the author present a believable although not entirely accurate case to support the notion a claim in the third step of their reason that vancouver handgun regulation be much more stringent but their evidence on the difference in gun availabilty be indirect and unpersuasive indeed they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point do not exist they offer two fragment of inferential datum in support of the claim that gun be more available in seattle but for all anybody know a a matter of empirical fact the opposite could be true we be therefore be ask at the conclusion of the study to believe that a difference in gun availability explain the difference in homicide rate when a difference in gun availability ha not itself be establish indeed the situation be even more troublesome the first of the two indirect bite of evidence be a difference between the number of conceal weapon permit issue in seattle and the number of restricted-weapon permit issue in vancouver difference between the two city in the permit regulation render these two number strictly noncomparable the second bite of evidence be cook gun prevalence index which stand at percent for seattle but only percent for vancouver cook index however do not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in variou city it measure gun misuse it be an average of the percentage of homicide and suicide involve firearm in the present case the index show only that in homicide and suicide firearm be more likely to be use in seatte than in vancouver to take cook index a a measure of general firearm availability it must be assume that the proportional involvement of gun in homicide and suicide be directly relate to their relative availability in the general population but thi be exactly what the author be seek to prove to assume what one be seek to prove then to prove it on the basi of that assumption do ot constitute scientific evidence for anything even if we be to grant on the basi of no compel evidence that gun be le common in vancouver we might still question what cause what the author attribute seattle higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership but it might well be argue that low crime or homicide rate reduce the motivation for average citizen to obtain gun in other word that crime rate explain the variation in gun ownership not vice versa in fact it wa once commonly argue that great britain low rate of violent crime wa a function of that nation strict gun law and the consequent low rate of gun ownership until british researcher colin greenwood find that great britain have enjoy low rate of violent crime for many decade before strict firearm control be enact to invoke an ancient methodological saw correlation be not cause nor do the problem with thi study end with it lack of direct datum on gun ownership the author say seattle and vancouver be similar in many way imply that they differ mainly in gun availability gun-law stringency and crime rate thi be an evident attempt to establish the ceteri paribu condition of a sound scientific analysi that all else be equal among thing be compare clearly the two city be similar in some way but a closer look reveal difference in way that be relevant to their respective crime or homicide rate the city be closely match in what percentage of their population be white percent and percent but seattle be about percent black while vancouver be le than percent vancouver minority population be overwhelmingly asian so although the author show that th two city be approximately comparable on a half dozen readily available demographic indicator they have not show that all potentially relevant source of variation have be rule out in fact the difference in racial composition of the two city be particularly relevant in light of the study breakdown of homicide rate accord to the race of the victim for the white majority the homicide rate be nearly identical per in seattle in vancouver the differ overall homicide rate in the two city be therefore due entirely to vastly different rate among racial minority for black the observe difference in homicide rate be to and for hispanic to methodoligical complexity render the asian comparison problematic but it too be higher in seattle than in vancouver racial minority be much more likely to be the victim of homicide in seattle than in vancouver the white majority be equally likely to be slay in either city since the nearly initial difference in homicide reate between the city be due exclusively to or difference between minority group it be fair to ask why postulate difference in gun availability or gun-law strigency would matter so dramatically to minority but not matter at all to white can differential gun availability explain why black and hispanic but not white be so much more likely to be kill in seattle than in vancouver study in the united state incidentally do not show large or consistent racial difference in gun ownership or be other explanation more plausible could the disparity between canadian and american rate of poverty among racial minority have anything to do with it what be the relative rate of drug or alcohol abuse of homelessnes among each cty minority population the city of seattle run the largest shelter for homeles man west of the mississippus unemployment among young central-city nonwhite man in the united state usually exceed percent what be the comparable canadian percentage the crucial point be that canada and the united state differ in many way a do city and population subgroup with the two country absent more detail analysi nearly any of these many way might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rate in gros comparison such a those between seattle and vancouver all else be not equal the author of thi study acknowledge that racial pattern in homicide result in a complex picture they do not acknowledge that the ensue complexity seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument they also acknowledge that socio-economic statu be probably an important confound factor in my comparison remark further that black in vancouver have a slightly higher mean income in than the rest of vancouver population given the evidence present in the article it be possible that all of the difference in homicide rate between seattle and vancouver result from greater proverty among seattle racial minority but the author pay no further attention to thi possibility since detail information about household income accord to race be not available for vancouver the largely insurmountable methodological difficulty confront in gros comparative study of thi sort can be illustrate with a simple example if one be to take all couty and compare them in term of pervalence of gun ownership and crime or homicide rate one would find an astonish pattern county with more gun have le crime would one conclude from thi evidence alone that gun actually reduce crime or would one insist that other variable also be take into account in thi example the hide variable be city size gun be more common in small town and rural area wherea crime be a big-city problem if researcher fail to anticipate thi variable or lack the appropriate datum to examine it possible consequence they coud be very seriously mislead in the study at hand the author match two city for size but not for minority poverty rate or other hide variable and their result be impossible to interpret in the editorial firearm injury a call for science accompany the study two official from the center for disease control laud the author for apply scientific method to a problem of grave public heath significance but in attempt to draw causal conclusion from nonexperimental research the essence of scientific method be to anticipate plausible alternative explanation for the result and try to rule them out absent such effort the result may well seem scientific but be little more than polemic masquerade a seriou research that thi study be but one of a number of recent effort all employ practical identical research design and publish in lead scientific journal be cause for further concern jame d wright be professor of sociology at tulane university he ha
