from viking dan sorenson subject re weapon and the militium long fcrary frank crary write down to odd line we must be make progress on an ironic note where i delete line emac continually give me the message garbage collect done think it try to tell me something viking dan sorenson write and thank you it a great change from the same tire old debate you lurker can join in at any time you know ahhh the kindler gentler newsgroup who would have think no not exactly the only reason for thi sort of restriction be the possible endangerment of other a poorly maintain rifle be dangerou but only to the user since it do endanger other there be no justification for such restriction i remind you of shrapnel i consider a reasonable space limitation but make no mistake a gun blow up be a hazard to those nearby say in the next lane at the range my point wa at what distance or level of threat we draw the line is it the endangerment of other so we do a restriction or the possibility of be shoot hence we draw a mile restriction or a nuke and draw a mile restriction to me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict base upon the instrument rather than place the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulder of the user perhap sen metzenbaum declare the barrett light fifty an assault rifle ha make thi more apparent to me since the barrett ha only range and acurracy go for it they have determine that their life be worth the effort to protect their home and family using nuclear weapon close to home will not accomplish thi i disagree on the grind that a house can be rebuild much more easily than my family once i have die i assume that word would get to the citizen that such an attack wa plan if thi be not the case the tactical and strategic implication change quite a bite personally my home be worth say twenty martian intent on take over the world my family all of them the balance act here be hard to judge sit at my desk there be however another problem in any case of civil war the strength of the militia fight on each side should reflect the popular will if the public be split versu then the minority militia should be at a disadvantage such a need for popular support would hopefully prevent insurrection unles the person really be behind the rebel but heavy weapon own by a small fraction of the militium could distort thi what if the minority include all the tank and artillery owner that seem to be the case already give that heavy weapon be commonly own by the citizenry with such low number obviously due to cost i do think the superior weapon be go to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe furthermore it be even more doubtful their train include proper tactical movement that best utilize tank wherea the commonly rifleman be not so hamper in effectivenes i think it be vital to avoid such a situation where a small minority would have a reasonable chance of gain political power through violence to prevent thi it may be necessary to give control of heavy weapon those which only a small number of individual would own and whose firepower would grossly distort the relation between popular support and military strength to someone other that individual militiaman thi be certainly not a good thing but i think it be the lesser of two evil whoever control these weapon must be a democratic body responsive to the will of the person i have envision that the armorer perhap the officer of a select group and the like would exercise control over the heavier more complex weapon but if joe bob own an old sherman tank i certainly would ask him to give it up follow order from the officer ye since the expense of a tank be so large though chance be it would be jointly purchase and should therefore be jointly maintain and operate here i think we have to be carefull about which state we be talk about certainly one role of the militium be to overthrow a repressive government and it would be completely destructive to that end for that same government to control the militium arm but the united state have several level of government each able to act independently but not all likely target of rebelion a such rebelion against state and local government be very unlikely i think therefore that the state or possibly local government could safely be allow to keep the select militium heavy weapon the risk of abuse while still something to consider be far le than the similar risk be the federal government in control thi i agree with to a point the state have control over the heavy weapon should not be justification for the state to have them centrally locate keep them spread out such that the ability of the state to lock them up be so easy otherwise i would have to assume that state control would rest on the authority of the governor and militium officer that be eaxctly why i think they should be remove the select militium should privide the militium heavy weapon and highly-trained specialist for the reason i have outline above i think these heavy weapon tank artillery aircraft etc be better off be keep by local government than by a small number of individual however local government should be able to use the select militium without the support to the person ideally the general militium under the direct control of the person and the select militium under the direction of democratic local government would opperate together but even in the worst case the general militium should be able to functional without the select militium similarly the select militium should be incapable of action without the aid of the general militium i have a hard time see how these heavy weapon fairly few in number could not be easily wield by a few person with government support just a you argue above that the weapon should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side do have all of them i ca see where thi situation be alleviate in have the select militium hold all the weapon and the unorganized militium be the infantry i think a better mix be call for but i would argue that the federal army should rely upon the select militium and the unorganized militium for the bulk of it infantry unit consider then the effect of remove the national guard infantry and place the guard under the control of local government the government-controled select militium could not fight effectively without infantry support provide by the general militium an inherently infantry organization on the other hand the general militium could function although at a disadvantage without the back of local government and the select militium we have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled force and if they all the equipment an infantry force the size would be in trouble i like to see that heavy stuff say tank offset by the local troup have a few and anti-tank weapon in their armory these would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and train requirement be figure in i suppose i quibble over what constitute heavy equipment but a mechanize infantry unit be what build dike in time of flood set up disaster relief city and the like i would much rather see these thing handle by the local general militia so would i but the resource often be available to outfit local unit well enough thu we will certainly have to call in other and a mechanize unit carry more stuff faster than anything else perhap the national guard be a close to my conception of the select militium a i think i wa consider them to be the heavy arm of the militium not the infantry arm of the regular army perhap my idea of heavy weapon be different i think main battle tank self-propelled artillery and and up field piece be heavy stuff troop carrier ton truck humvee old tank howitzer be more the stuff of a mechanize infantry actually thi be what the guard unit in iowa be currently field in some unit perhap it be just my innate fear of have the real heavy equipment under state control with little but number and light stuff to act a a deterrent allowing main battle tank to the state should be balance with anti-tank capability in the local rank similarly local unit would need to band together quickly hence small and fast response mean mechanize infantry finally the militium be more than just fight equipment be need for other response the federal army i convince should have a very minumum of infantry rely on the state and local militia for these function dan sorenson dod viking isu only censor what i read not what i say do
