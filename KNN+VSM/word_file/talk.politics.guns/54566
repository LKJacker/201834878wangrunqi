from rboudrie robert a boudrie subject re some more about gun control in article cescript charle scripter write in article jrutledg john lawrence rutledge write in article arc aaron ray clement write the second amendment be a guarantee of the right to bear arm clearly and unequivocally without infringement unfortunately the second amendment be not a clear a you state if last part of it be take along it follow what you have say the problem i have be with the first part of the single sentence which make up the amendment the second amendment be a well regulate militium be necessary to the security militium of a free state the right of the person to keep and bear state arm shall not be infringe arm you do even get the capitalization correct try read usca on the constitution or get any other correct version of the constitution thi mention of a well regulate militium be what confuse me according to the federalist paper a well regulate militium ha a well define structure and follow nationally uniform regulation perhap you should actually read the federalist paper jame madison federalist paper beside the advantage of be arm which the american posse over the person of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate government to which the person be attach and by which the militium officer be appoint form a barrier against the enterprise of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of notwithstanding the military establishment in the several kingdom of europe which be carry a far a the public resource will bear the government be afraid to trust the person with arm jame madison i annal of congres june the right of the person to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe a well regulate militium compose of the body of the person train to arm be the best and most natural defense of a free country alexander hamilton federalist paper on the organization of the militium little more can reasonably be aim at with respect to the person at large than to have them properly arm and equip and in order to see that thi be not neglect it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year alexander hamilton federalist paper speak of stand army if circumstance should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberty of the person while there be a large body of citizen little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arm who stand ready to defend their own right and those of their fellow-citizen but surely hamilton and madison do mean the person when they say person right that why the amendment refer to the right of the militium ymy average year old male do not fall into the definition you right the militium consist of all able body male and probably female under current interpretation therefore most member of the militium the one the every gun advocate refer to be not member of a well organize militium and therefore be not directly the amendment do nor refer to well organize it say well regulate i have some target you may examine if you wish to check how well regulate i be mention in the amendment if thi amendment want to allow every member of the militium to keep and bear arm why do it specificly mention a well organize militium in the same sentence a the right to keep and bear arm correct that why the right be reserve to the person and that wa to insure the person could form a well regulate militium not a well organize militium it could be argue that the first part of the sentence be separate from the last part if so why wa it include in the same atomic unit of write what do atomic unit have to do with thi argument any moron can set c instead of a separate sentence oh i see what ymy question be why do you read the federalist paper jame madison federalist paper regard the general welfare clause nothing be more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particular but what do madison know about the grammatical style of the he only write it the amendment also imply that the right to arm ha to due with the security of a free state the federalist paper mention of a well regulate militium gife many example of how thi militium protect the security of a free state all these example be action of a very organize force not some john q public with a gun that obviously because you never actually read the federalist paper all that the second amendment clearly state to me be that the person right to form well regulate militia shall not be infringe that be person have the right to join a well organize militium thi well organize militium will of course provide train in how to use arm and in basic military tactic these train member of the militium can keep and bear the arm ca read huh show me where the document say well organize militium lastly read through the federalist paper on well organize militium it be very clear that many of the reason for these militia one reason state be the protection from a stand army these day the stand army could easily defeat a group consist of every year old male and female not in the armied force that be exactly why every person should be allow to own any weapon currently in use in the arm force another reason state for well organize militia be to reduce the need for a stand army well the u armied force have be a stand army for more than half the history of the u but the major reason be to protect against that very same army it seem to me the whole reason for the second amendment to give the person protection from the u government by guarantee that the person can over through the government if necessary be a little bite of an anachronism be thi day and age maybe it time to re-think how thi should be do and amend the constitution appropriately abraham lincoln first inaugural addres march thi country with it institution belong to the person who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the exist government they can exercise their constitutional right of amend it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it rep elbridge gerry of massachusett speak during floor debate over the second amendment i annal of congres at august what sir be the use of a militium it be to prevent the establishment of a stand army the bane of liberty whenever government mean to invade the right and liberty of the person they alway attempt to destroy the militium in order to raise an army upon their ruin so now we know which category mr
