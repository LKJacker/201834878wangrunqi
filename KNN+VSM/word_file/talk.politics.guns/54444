subject is it really apple to apple lawful v unlawful use of gun from john kim i have be convince of the right of american to an effective self-defense but something strike me a odd among the pro-rkba argument present here the number compare hundred of thousand indeed even a million of instance of law abide citizen deter criminal activity seem valid to me likewise the number of gun-caused homicide each year about however it be surprise that the evil antigun empire darth vader breathe sound effect here never try to compare all legitimate gun defense v all gun crime instead it alway all legitimate gun defense which include case in which the criminal be shoot but not kill and case in which the criminal be not here v just criminal gun homicide which only include case sin which the victim die why be thi of course it would be unreasonable to say that in each crime already measure involve gun the consequnce be already know and it be safe to assume that a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn into a gun-basd wherea in the legitimate gun defense one may assume that all those criminal who be deter would have commit more crime or more seriou crime have they not be deter case kim
