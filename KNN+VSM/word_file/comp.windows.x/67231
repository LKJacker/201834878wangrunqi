from lanzo mark lanzo subject re key definition in emac x in a prior article ajaffe andrew jaffe write hi i use emac and i want to customize my keyboard better when i set up stuff in my emac with a keymap and define-key i can only acces certain of the key on my x-terminal keyboard i ca get home end pgup pgdn they all seem to have either the same or no keycode i have a feel thi ca be fix in emac itself but that i need to do some xmodmap stuff can someone help me unfortunately the key event handle be pretty much hardwired into emac i run into thi problem a while back my solution wa to change the source code so that all of these special key generate character sequence which basically encode the keysym and modifier state a escape sequence for example the sequence esc b would indicate that the home key wa press with the shift key down you could also detect standard key with odd modifier such a shift-return if anybody want these change they welcome to them but you have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bite basically you have to replace the keypres handle code in the source file maybe if someone at osf be interest i can send them the tweak but i imagine they get bigger fish to fry hopefully include the much talk about emac if there sufficient interest i post the mod somewhere although thi probably be the appropriate group for it note thi special code will only apply if you let emac create it own window if you run it in plain old tty mode which include xterm window then it busines a usual the patch i make be to version under sun o i also do thi a while back under hp-ux the patch be in a chunk of code between if sun endif but could easily be adapt for anything else mark lanzo lanzo xx
