thi faq include information on a number of gotcha that can bite you on particular system however the best source of general information on build the release be find in the release note the file be bundle separately from the rest of the release so if it become separate from ymy source you can ftp another copy separately the file relnote m ps txt at the top of the distribution the file relnote be also available from the xstuff mail server in addition associate volume on x administration include information on configure and build x subject why do my sun with a work with apparently gcc be the problem it seem to produce fine code for all sun display except for the cgsix the new distribute with may fix the problem note not know to work on solari subject why do my sun with suno know about dlsym etc if you get error with dlsym dlopen dlclose undefined link with add ldl to ymy and eventually ymy you may want to surround it with bstatic ldl bdynamic if you add it to the variable since syslib get add after on the eventual compilation command otherwise you may not have a share libdl or compile the stub share thank to joe backo subject what be thi strange problem build x client on suno in suno sun fix a shared-library bug in ld which conflict with the way build the share xmu library cause these symbol to be undefined when build some client compiling bstatic lxmu bdynamic appear to work to solve the problem if you be use openwindow xt please contact ymy local sun office and request the follow patch patch description openwindow libxt jumbo patch openwindow undefined symbol when use share libxmu greg earle earle a source patch for use with the mit library wa develop by conrad kimball cek it retrofit into some fix make in to get around thi problem the patch be on export in subject why ca gcc compile on my sparc i use gcc to compile the whole distribution but i get several segmentation fault when run x note first that gcc on risc machine do not necessarily result in any performance increase it certainly be not a noticeable a it be on the or vax platform here be the problem gcc and cc use incompatible method of pass structure a argument and return them a function value so when gcc-compiled part of x be link with sun-supplied function that pa or return struct run-time error occur affected program include rgb and the server thi be from the gcc manual on the sparc gnu cc use an incompatible call convention for structure it pas them by include their content in the argument list wherea the standard compiler pas them effectively by reference thi really ought to be fix but such call convention be not yet support in gnu cc so it be straightforward to fix it the convention for structure return be also incompatible and fpcc-struct-return do not help you can duck the problem either by use cc throughout or by use it for just the routine which cause incompatibility the problem can not be solve with compilation flag file which need to be compile use cc include in addition several of the inet function use struct a arg or return value call to in and be possibly harmles a they do involve struct collect by bashford don bashford subject what be these error run x build with gcc when i try to run xinit or the xsun server i get the error getting interface configuration operation not support on socket fatal server bug no screen find running the gcc fixinclude script apparently do work you can do thi simple test include siocgifconf run that through cc e and gcc e the last line of output be the piece of interest it should be identical modulo irrelevant difference like whitespace if the gcc version ha where the cc version ha ymy fixinclude run do work for some reason or other go back to ymy gcc source and run fixinclude then rebuild the x distribution if they be identical try run a make clean in and rebuild just to make sure everything get compile with the proper include file courtesy der mouse mouse subject what be these problem compile on the older in we have find miss define for what should these be the erratum list distribute after mention that you can add these line to the file on older suno version to compile define define define define however the should not actually ever have the device and so reference to it can be remove from and the imakefile subject what be these problem compile the x server on suno the file be be find sun omit from suno remove the include from and replace it with the line define the file ha change from earlier version of suno and should not be copy from another distribution subject what be these problem use share library on suno all of the executable that i try to run have the follow result not find or even call to undefined procedure gethostname from if you be build with share library on a sun remember that you need to run ldconfig a root after instal the share library if you instal x on a file-server run it on the server client too while build and instal the distribution you need to be careful to avoid link against any exist x share library you might have those distribute with openwindow you should make sure you do not have set in ymy environment during the build or the installation if you be go to keep xterm and xload a setuid program please note that the share library must be instal in or for these program to work or else those program must be link statically courtesy mit x consortium note also that the program mkfontdir be run a part of the build it attempt however to use the share library before they have be instal you can avoid the error by build mkfontdir statically pa bstatic to most c compiler subject can olit program run with xt xtqstring undefined thi be a bug in the olit xtqstring wa an external symbol that exist in upon which ow libxt be base it wa document and wa remove in mit guarantee of upward compatibility between the and library only apply to the document interface a workaround be to temporarily set ymy to point to the or openwindow xt library that you link the program against from barry margolin barmar from jeff franci jpf subject how do i get around the suno security hole there be a security problem with certain client xterm and xload run under suno that have be instal setuid root and be use share library to avoid the problem do one of these make the program non-setuid you should consult ymy system administrator concern protection of resource pty and use by these program to make sure that you do not create additional security problem at ymy site relink the program statically use bstatic install the library before link and link with absolute path to the library from rw bob scheifler the version of xterm do thi automatically by rebuild xterm against the newly-installed library when xterm be be instal thi prevent an suid program from be build with library specify relatively note that thi may cause an inconvenience when do the installation from nfs-mounted disk xload ha be rewrite to avoid the problem subject how do i get around the frame-buffer security hole on many system the frame-buffer be unsecured by default thi permit anyone who can log into ymy workstation to peek at ymy windowing session by access the frame-buffer directly or a le of a privacy issue but perhap more annoy to accidentally start up a second x session on ymy console display check the man page for fbtab thank to art mulder art subject topic building x program subject what be imake imake be not a replacement for the make program instead it be a makefile-generator that take advantage of the include-file and macro process capability of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefile suitable for build software on a particular system although it be not specific to x the x release use it to help solve a number of the configuration issue that arise in make such a large system widely portable imake ha a fairly steep learn curve in part because the proces by which the system-specific configuration file system-independent configuration file and individual imakefile be meld to produce a makefile be not obviou there have be several different version of imake the and version be different you can obtain information on imake from these source the and release note and imake man page include information on use imake to build x the and file also contain useful information on the tape be mark morae guide to imake the contain a paper by jim fulton on an early version of imake paul duboi duboi ha write a useful explanation of how imake work and how to use it in configure x for non support system the document be available from in the directory look for troff and postscript some supplemental appendice be nearby document version be now these imake paper be available by email mail a message body of send imake-stuff help to almanac see system administration imake friend of foe by dinah mcnutt in the november issue of sunexpert german reader should expect in june an article da meta-make i make you make schwerelo by rainer klute in ix multiuser-multitasking-magazin direct at application programmer need to write imakefile an english-language derivative of thi article be in the x journal issue the x resource issue contain paul davey article on demystify imake alain brossard work document full of tip on imake be in subject where can i get imake version be distribute with the and release an earlier version be distribute with the release some third-party toolkit redistribute version of imake along with their own implementation of the template and configuration file there be no real standard for such configuration file although most current contribute software expect the template distribute with export contain the distribution unpack so you can pick up imake without pick up the entire distribution a stand-alone version of imake but one stem from be in subject i have a program with an imakefile but no makefile what to do if you have or instal on ymy system run xmkmf thi be a script which run imake for you with the correct argument the output be a makefile configure for ymy system and base on the imakefile then run make which will use that new makefile to compile the program subject why ca i link to the xlib shape routine when i try to compile certain program i get the follow link error undefined xshapequeryextension xshapecombinemask these routine be actually part of the shape extension to x shape which wa introduce in the mit distribution and allow non-rectangular window like the other sample server extension the shape extension will only run on a server which support it server a well a many vendor-supplied server do not support the shape extension in which case they will display rectangular window anyway in order to use the shape extension you must link to the library in the distribution thi library and the associate include will be in the directory if you do not have these file do not despair many freeware program which use the shape extension can also be compile without it by remove the dshape define from the makefile you can probably do thi and compile successfully against ymy older vendor-supplied x library from john b melby melby subject what be these problem with xtinherit not find on the sun when i run a x program that i write on a suno or machine i get the error symbol not find xtinherit what you be see be a side-effect of a kludge in the to get sun share library work apparently you ca share a function that be both call and compare a xtinherit be thi wa handle by put xtinherit in the same file a a function that be alway use thereby guarantee that it would be load that be in where xttoolkitinitialize and xtinitialize reside these routine would normally be call you be probably see thi error because ymy program be not a normal xt-based program and do not call xttoolkitinitialize anywhere it may be a program that use xt function but never open a connection to the x server uil have thi problem it call xtmalloc and other xt function the solution be to add the call to ymy program the function do not have to be execute just link in alternatively ymy program do need any xt function and be correct in not call xttoolkitinitialize it may be an xlib or xview program in thi case you can remove lxt from ymy link command it should not be necessary to link the share library statically although thi will certainly solve the problem from jordan haye now jordan and danny backx db subject why ca i compile my xaw contrib program under the new x i have a program that work well under when i try to link it under the current version of x i get thi message undefined xtscrollbarsetthumb xttextsetinsertionpoint xttextreplace there be several name change in the athena widget set in addition to the header file move into these be mention in the release note in thi case these function be not really xt function but be part of the xaw text widget and so have be rename from xt to xaw subject topic programming problem and puzzle subject why do my program get the keystroke i select for sic the window manager control how the input focu be transfer from one window to another in order to get keystroke ymy program must ask the window manager for the input focu to do thi you must set up what be call hint for the window manager if ymy application be xlib-based you can use something like the follow xwmhint wmhint inputhint true xsetwmhint dpy window wmhint if ymy application be base on the xt intrinsic you can set the xtninput resource to be true a you probably want to in any case if you do have source you can start up the application with the resource true certain window manager notably dxwm and olwm be very picky about have thi do if you be use sun openwindow olwm you can also add thi resource to ymy default file to use client that be icccm-compliant true mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart mark of sun subject how do i figure out what window manager be run you ca reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be spoof in any case for most case you should care which window manager be run so long a you do thing in an icccm-conformant manner there be some case in which particular window manager be know to do thing wrong check for particular hint place on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these case alternatively it may be appropriate to determine which window manager be run in order to take advantage of specific add feature such a olwm push-pin menu in order to give ymy program add functionality beware of usurp the window manager function by provide that functionality even when it be miss thi surely lead to future compatibility problem subject is there a skeleton x program available there be no general framework such a the transskel program for the macintosh which handle lot of the odd and end and overhead of development under a window system and which can be use a a platform for additional development in x the problem be typically solve by use an interactive application builder tool or by use cut paste on exist x application good application which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just thi one little thing include a simple program that put up a window and allow sketch in it and offer a start point for quick hack the xaw example in the example directory in the and distribution and the xlib hello world example in the and an update version of thi program which use xlib call and current icccm convention wa post in to by glenn widener of tektronix in addition a sample xt program for xaw or xm by rainer klute show how to open multiple display and how to catch a break display connection be available on in subject why do xtgetvalue not work for me sic the xtgetvalue interface for retrieve resource from a widget be sensitive to the type of variable ymy code may be do something like thi arg arg int i int sensitive oop wrong datum type xtsetarg arg i xtnsensitive sensitive i xtgetvalue widget arg i but xtnsensitive be a boolean which on most machine be a single byte declare the variable sensitive a boolean work properly thi problem come up often when use particular toolkit that redefine the xt type dimension and position code that assume they be int will have similar problem if those type be actually short in general you be safe if you use the actual type of the resource a it appear in the widget man page subject why do work you probably try to use these function from application code they should be use only internally to widget these function be for a parent widget to change the geometry of it child other promise function xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest be also for use only by widget in thi case by a child to request a change from it parent the only way for ymy application to request a geometry change for a widget be to issue an xtsetvalue call set some of the geometry resource although thi will result in the widget-internal function be call ymy application code must use the standard xtsetvalue interface or risk the widget datum become corrupt the xlib call xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarly be avoid they should be use to change xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight subject why be there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow although there be variou detail of the current implementation of the xt internal which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no such call exist be that it remain undefined what the set of resource for the new widget should be resource be typically set base on the location in the instance hierarchy what resource should change if the instance move what should happen to the widget child and by the time such semantic be define there would probably be little advantage over destroy the old widget and create a new widget in the correct location with the desire resource a set the resource correctly be the majority of work in create a new widget note that reparenting be possible in the ous toolkit david b lewi faq craft just the faq joe friday david b lewi temporarily at but not speak for visual inc day dbl even david craft
