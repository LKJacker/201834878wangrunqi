from rob earhart earhart subject re animation with xputimage dcr derek c richardson write shared memory putimage also mention by nkissebe nick kisseberth look interest but i need someone to point me to some documentation is thi method likely to give better result than server resident pixmap i also be interest in look at the xview code mention above there documentation on how to use the share memory extension in the distribution actually i just finish write a motif animation program take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast when use on-server pixmap or share memory i have to insert a delay loop to keep it from go too quickly testing both method side by side they be just about equal the advantage of shm be that ymy x server do grow to ridiculou size but pixmap can work over a network and be remove if ymy application dy one tend to use ipcrm manually quite a bite when debug shm app shared memory also ha the problem that some operate system ultrix seem to allow only a small number of segment to be attach to a proces at once consequently a redraw become xshmattach xshmputimage xshmdetach on dec system and dec bite display like the one i tend to use most often do seem to support the extension maybe someone compile them wrong and use pixmap cause the x server to crash fail malloc so one ha to use the local unix domain socket which really be that bad one copy the info three time per redraw instead of one in short allow all three form of display within the program be a good thing minu shm if run over a network and let the user pick whatever feel fastest i just use an ximagehandler clas and forget about it rob
