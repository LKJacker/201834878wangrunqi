from jgealow jeffrey c gealow subject standard colormap i work on an application and have concern regard standard colormap the documentation say usually a window manager create these colormap i wonder what window manager the writer have in mind neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormap of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormap however xstdcmap do seem to try very hard to avoid conflict with the default colormap when i use standard colormap create by xstdcmap the rest of my display go black so it seem a if use of standard colormap cause the very problem standard colormap be intend to avoid perhap if every application use standard colormap thing would be wonderful but not many application seem to use standard colormap finally the operation of the function xmugetcolormapallocation xmustandardcolormap and xmucreatecolormap seem inconsistent with the section of the xlib documentation according to the section of the xlib documentation p for grayscale colormap only the colormap and member be define the other member be ignore to compute a grayscale pixel value use the follow expression gray xmugetcolormapallocation define in be use by xmulookupstandardcolormap define in to select and value for the call to xmustandardcolormap when the property be specify xmugetcolormapallocation set to of the total number of cell in the gray scale set to of the total number and set ot of the total number referring to section one would expect xmugetcolormapallocation to set to the total number of cell in the gray scale when the property be specify xmustandardcolormap define in set and all equal to referring to section one would expect and to be ignore when and all equal xmucreatecolormap define in construct a gray map the sum of and gife the maximum gray value referring to section on would expect to give the maximum gray value
