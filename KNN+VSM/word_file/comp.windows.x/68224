from hildjj joe hildebrand subject re help need callback action and event i understand that there be two method to connect application code to widget callback and action the problem i face now be that i have a quite long piece of application code that perform a lot of draw into a window i want to connect thi to a widget no problem so far i could use a callback function or an action to do thi process any event afterward but because the draw take some while i want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupt by event then i want to handle the event and resume with process the application code at the point it wa interrupt it seem to me that thi be possible but how can i give the user the impression that hi input be immediately process use a workproc see xtappaddworkproc you should split ymy draw routnie up into small chunk thi be the hard part then in the callback that start the draw you call xtappaddworkproc to call ymy workproc the first time ymy workproc should be a function that return a boolean true when you be finish and false when you want to keep process if you return false the workproc be automatically re-installed note that thi method be better that use a time-out loop since event get process in a more precedence-oriented manner if you be use the same ada bind i be however you be hose and should look into xtappaddtimeout joe hildebrand hildjj software engineer fuentez system concept standard disclaimer apply
