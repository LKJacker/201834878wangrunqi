from rgooch richard gooch subject re motif v athena etc in article bambi david j hughe write i be also concern by thi prevalence of motif particularly from the point of view of write and obtain free software a the linux and community grow however i think that motif will lose some of it grip at least in the non-commercial marketplace port of motif to both and linux be available for a fee of about thi be cost recovery for the person who buy the right to redistribute the activity in both the bsd and linux news group pertain to motif ha be high i just wonder if thi will also cause a divergence between commercial and non-commercial software ie you will only get free software use athena or openlook widget set and only get commercial software use the motif widget set i ca see why if just about every workstation will come with motif by default and you can buy it for under for the free unix platform i ca see thi cause major problem i think you will find that the active linux and community be populate by enthusiast who would object to pay any money for software otherwise they would probably have go for a commercial unix an important factor in the linux community be that source code be alway available thi be probably similar in the community however i not really involve there many person use linux like to stay at the cut bleed edge ie when kernel patch c library or compiler patch come out person like to rebuild their entire system the prime requirement for all linux software be that it be available under a gnu style public license hence linux software use either the athena widget or xview individual may write software require motif but i doubt it be widely adopt regard richard gooch
