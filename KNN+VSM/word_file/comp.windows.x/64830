should read the current ioccc rule prior to submit entry x the rule be typically send out with these guideline x x xwhat is new in x x the entry format be better for u anyway the program x ha be update see entry format x x we will reject entry that can not be compile use an ansi c x compiler certain old obfuscation hack that cause ansi c compiler x fit be no longer permit some of the new issue deal with x non-integral array type variable number of argument c preprocessor x directive and the exit function see my like and dislike x x xhint and suggestion x x you be encourage to examine the winner of previou contest see x for more information for detail on how to get previou winner x x keep in mind that rule change from year to year so some win entry x may not be valid entry thi year what wa unique and novel one year x might be the next year x x an entry be usually examine in a number of way we typically apply x a number of test to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi tri-graph to ascius x c pre-proces the source ignore include line x c pre-proces the source ignore define and include line x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x you should consider how ymy entry look in each of the above test x you should ask yourself if ymy entry remain obscure after it ha be x up by the c pre-processor and a c beautifier x x ymy entry need not do well under all or in most test in certain x case a test be not important entry that compete for the x creative source layout need not do a well a x other in term of their algorithm on the other hand give x two such entry we be more incline to pick the entry that x do something interest when you run it x x we try to avoid limit creativity in my rule a such we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation a in real life x program interpret a requirement document or a customer request x be important for thi reason we often award abuse of the x rule to an entry that illustrate thi point in an ironic way x x if you do plan to abuse the rule we suggest that you let u know x in the remark section please note that an invitation to abuse x be not an invitation to break we be strict when it come to the x byte size limit also abuse the entry format tend to x annoy more than amuse x x we do realize that there be hole in the rule and invite entry x to attempt to exploit them we will award abuse of the rule x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use x the smallest plug need if not smaller x x check out ymy program and be sure that it work we sometime make x the effort to debug an entry that ha a slight problem particularly x in or near the final round on the other hand we have see some x of the best entry fall down because they do work x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claim that x be a prime number if you do have a bug you be better off x document it noting thi entry sometime print the power x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometime x a strange can even help the entry of course a correctly x work entry be best x x xmy like and dislike x x doing mass of define to obscure the source ha become we x tend to thru mass of define due to my pre-processor test x that we apply simply abuse define or wo go a far x a a program that be more well round in confusion x x many ansi c compiler dislike the follow code and so do we x x define d define x d foo do expect thi to turn into define foo x x int i x j do use such implicit type declaration x int k x x we suggest that you compile ymy entry with an ansi c compiler if you x must use non-ansi c such a k r c you must avoid area that result in x error for ansi c compiler x x unfortunately ansi c require array index to be of integral type x thu the follow classical obfuscation hack be no longer allow x x int i x char c x i c use c i instead x string use string instead x x if ymy entry use function that have a variable number of x argument be careful system implement a a wide variety x of way because of thi a number of operation use be x not portable and must not be use x x assign a variable a variable x cast a variable a variable x pass a variable to a function expect a arg x pass a variable to a function expect a arg x perform arithmetic on variable x use a a structure or union x x in particular do not treat variable a if they be a char x x avoid use use instead x x if you use c preprocessor directive define if ifdef x the lead must be the first character on a line while some x c preprocessor allow whitespace the lead many do not x x because the exit function return void on some system entry x must not assume that it return an int x x small program be best when they be short obscure and concise x while such program be not a complex a other winner they do x serve a useful purpose they be often the only program that person x attempt to completely understand for thi reason we look for x program that be compact and be instructional x x one line program should be short one line program say around x byte long getting close to byte be a bite too long in my opinion x x we tend to dislike program that x x be very hardware specific x be very o or version specific x difference be ok but specific x code be likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warn x it be ok only if you warn u in the header item x wo compile under both bsd or sy v x abuse the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri-graph x be longer than they need to be x be similar to previou winner x be identical to previou loser x x unles you be cramp for space or unles you be enter the x one liner category we suggest that you format ymy program x in a more creative way than simply form excessively long line x x the build file should not be use to try and get around the size x limit it be one thing to make use of a several d to help out x but it be quite another to use byte of d in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel x free to make use of the build file space but you be better off x if you show some amount of restraint x x we allow whitespace and in certain case or do not impact x ymy program size up to a certain point because we want to get x away from source that be simply a compact blob of character x x given two version of the same program one that be a compact blob x of code and the other that be format more like a typical c x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third x version of the same program that be format in an interest x obfuscate way would definitely win over the first two x x we suggest that you avoid try for the self-replicating x program we be amaze at the many different size that claim x to be the smallest there be nothing wrong with self-replicating x program in fact a number of winner have be self-replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of lest we or other x know of a smaller one x x x client entry should be a portable a possible entry that x adapt to a wide collection of environment will be favor do x depend on a particular type of display for example do depend x on color or a give size do require back store x x x client entry should avoid use x relate library and x software that be not in wide spread use we ask that such x client x entry restrict themself to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set and x do use or toolkit since not everyone x ha them avoid depend on a particular window manager not x everyone ha and some person be stick back in or x earlier so try to target without require better x yet try to make ymy entry run on all version x window system x x x client entry should not to depend on particular item on x xdefault if you must do so be sure to note the require line x in the remark section x x we like program that x x be a concise and small a they need to be x do something at least quasi-interesting x pa lint without complaint not a requirement but it be nice x be portable x be unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different type of obfuscation x make u laugh throw up x x some type of program ca excel in some area of course ymy x program do have to excel in all area but do well in several x area really do help x x we freely admit that interest creative or humorou comment in x the remark section help ymy chance of win if you have to x read of many twist entry you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the reader of the contest winner do a well x x be creative x x xentry format x x in order to help u proces the many entry we must request ymy x assistance by format ymy entry in a certain way thi format x in addition allow u to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself see judging proces x x we have provide the program mkentry a an example of how to x format entry you should be aware of the follow warn that x be find in x x thi program attempt to implement the ioccc rule every x attempt ha be make to make sure that thi program produce x an entry that conform to the contest rule in all case x where thi program differ from the contest rule the x contest rule will be use be sure to check with the x contest rule before submit an entry x x you be not require to use mkentry it be convenient however x a it attempt to uuencode the need file and attempt to check x the entry against the size rule x x if you have any suggestion comment fix or complaint about x the program please send email to the judge see

compile into prog if an entry win we will rename x it source and binary to avoid filename collision by tradition x we use the name of the entry title follow by an optional x digit in case of name conflict x x if the above entry somehow win the likely to win award x we would use and chonglab x x if ymy entry depend on or require that ymy build source x binary file be a particular name please say so in the x remark section if thi case apply it would be be helpful x if you do one of the follow x x tell u how to change the filename s in ymy entry x x have the build file make copy of the file for example x x cc o need special binary x x or rm f need special source x cp x cc o x x or rm f need special build x tail build x sh x x assume that we will use the entry title send u a version of x ymy file that use the name convention you x should uuencode these file in datum section x x if ymy entry need to modify it source info or binary file x please say so in the remark section you should try to avoid x touch ymy original build source and binary file you should x arrange to make copy of the file you intend to modify thi x will allow person to re-generate ymy entry from scratch x x remember that ymy entry may be build without a build file we x typically incorporate the build line into a makefile if the x build file must exist say so in the remark section x x if ymy entry need special info file you should uuencode them x into info section in the case of multiple info file x use multiple info section if no info file be need x then skip the info section x x info file be intend to be input or detail information that x do not fit well into the remark section for example an x entry that implement a compiler might want to provide some sample x program for the user to compile an entry might want to include a x lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x file x x info file should be use only to supplement ymy entry for x example info file may provide sample input or detail x information about ymy entry because they be supplemental x the entry should not require them exist x x in some case ymy info file might be rename to avoid name x conflict if info file should not be rename for some reason x say so in the remark section x x info file must uudecode into the current directory if they x absolutely must be rename or move into a sub-directory say x so in the remark section x x when submit multiple entry be sure that each entry ha x a unique entry number from to ymy first entry should x have entry number x x with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x format may be ignore that be do place text outside of the x entry and expect the judge to see it my decode tool be x ai prog if you need tell the the something put it in the x remark section or send a email to the judge at x x apple pyramid sun uunet hoptoad judge not the addres for x judge submit entry x x the date should be give with respect to utc some system refer x to thi a gmt or the format of the date should be that a x return by asctime in the c locale an example of such a string be x x thr apr x x thi format be similar to the output of the date command the x string do not include the timezone name before the year on many x system one of the follow command will produce a similar string x x date u a h d t y x date u sed e x sh c date sed e s x sh c date sed e s x sh c date sed e s x x you be allow to ymy entry to do so set x the line in the entry section to instead of x be sure that the resubmittion use the same title and entry number x a well a these be use to determine which entry be to be x replace x x xjudging proces x x entry be judge by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x entry be unpack into individual directory the email message x be unpack into individual file each contain x x entry section x all author section x all info section x build section x program section x any other text include the email message header x x prior to judge the other text file be scan to be sure x it do not contain useful information or in case the entry wa x malformed and do not unpack correctly information from the x author section be not read until the judge proces be x complete and then only from entry that have win an award x x the above proces help keep u bias any one particular x individual we be usually keep in the dark a much a you be x until the final award be give we like the surprise of find x out in the end who win and where they be from x x we attempt to keep all entry anonymou unles they win an award x because the main of win be be announce we make all x attempt to send non-winner into oblivion we remove all non-winning x file and shred all relate paper by tradition we do not even x reveal the number of entry that we receive for the curiou x we do indicate the volume of paper consume when present the ioccc x winner at talk x x after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x author of the win entry one reason we do thi be to give x the author a chance to comment on the way we have present their x entry they be give the chance to correct mistake typo we x often accept their about my remark a well x thi be do prior to post the winner to the wide world x x judging consist of a number of elimination round during a round x the collection of entry be divide into two roughly equal pile x the pile that advance on to the next round and the pile that do x not we also re-examine the entry that be eliminate in the x previou round thu an entry get at least two read x x a read consist of a number of action x x read the entry section x read the uudecoded build section x read the uudecoded program section x read the uudecoded info section s if any x pass the source thru the c pre-processor x ship over any include file x perform a number of c edit on the source x pass the beautify source thru the c pre-processor x ship over any include file x x in later round other action be perform x x linting the source x the source x run the program x perform misc test on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entry down to about entry entry x be judge on an individual basi an entry be set aside because it x do not in my opinion meet the standard establish by the round x when the number of entry thin to about entry we begin to form x award category entry begin to compete with each other for award x an entry often will compete in several category x x the actual award category list will vary depend on the type of entry x we receive a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x creative source layout x most useful obfuscate program x best game that be obfuscate x most creatively obfuscate program x most deceptive c code x best x client see my like and dislike x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rule x anything else so strange that it deserve an award x x we do not limit ourself to thi list for example a few entry be so x that they be declare winner at the start of the final round x we will invent award category for them if necessary x x in the final round proces we perform the difficult task of x reduce the remain entry typically about down to or x winner often we be confident that the entry that make it into x the final round be definitely better than the one that do not x make it the selection of the winner out of the final round be x le clear cut x x sometime a final round entry good enough to win but be beat out x by a similar but slightly better entry for thi reason it be x sometime worthwhile to re-enter an improve version of an entry x that fail to win in a previou year thi assume of course x that the entry be worth improve in the first place x x more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x layout entry and an entry that bus the contest x rule in some way x x in the end we traditionally pick one entry a sometime such x an entry simply far exceed any of the other entry more often the x be pick because it do well in a number of category x x xannouncement of winner x x the first announcement occur at a summer usenix conference by tradition x thi be do during the latter part of the bof just prior to x the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x winning entry will be post in late june to the follow group x x x x in addition pointer to these post be post to the follow x x x x x winning entry will be deposit into the uunet archive see x below for detail x x often win entry be publish in select magazine winner x have appear in book
