from seth seth buffington subject re gui study cutsie little macintrash-like icon that be an instant recipe for mousitis imho system be undoubtedly the worst gui i have use out of that risco mswomble and simply because it do not provide enough keyboard shortcut window i must confes i quite like cover ymy ear because you can actually use it without have to ever touch the mouse stuff delete the user rather than make thing easier and there should alway be the option to do it ymy way if you want to which be why i like the combination so much it so customizable hear hear i agree completely one thing i ca stand about the mac interface be it shear determination to force you to use the mouse what if ymy mouse break ymy whole system be down i like the mouse it be handy on some occassion such a cut and past and move icon around etc but for most work the keyboard and hot key be time faster than use the mouse sure it be a plu to be able to do something simple if you be an inexperienced user but how long be it before ymy be experience a month two speaking of pc at the moment i do think it be too much to ask that window programmer provide not only a interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot key and command line interface which usually allow you to do more in le time if you be experience all of the above equally apply to windowing system on unix especially since unix be at least more powerful than do seth buffington gab i seth seth unix operator
