from dbl david b lewi subject frequently asked question faq archive-name last-modified subject how do i make a screendump or print my application the xwd client in the distribution can be use to select a window or the background it produce an xwd-format file of the image of that window the file can be post-processed into something useful or print with the xpr client and ymy local print mechanism you can use thi command csh sleep xwd root and then spend second or so set up ymy screen the entire current display will be save into the file note that xwd also ha an undocumented before id flag for specify the window id on the command-line there be also unofficial patch on export to xwd for specify the delay and the portion of the screen to capture two publicly-available program which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portion of the display and built-in delay be asnap and xgrabsc there be several version of xgrabsc version available on export be the most recent xsnap include some asnap feature and supersede it it also render xpm output version unknown it be available on export or see a screen-dump and program combine feature of xwd and xpr be available from a information soft-eng xprint by alberto accomazzi alberto be available from in to post-proces the xwd output of some of these tool you can use xpr which be part of the distribution also on several archive be and xtop which produce encapsulated postscript with trim suitable for use in presentation see and also useful be the pbmplu package on many archive server and the xim package contain level color postscript output the xv program can grab a portion of the x display manipulate it and save it in one of the available format imagemagick ha similar capability also bristol technology info offer xprinter an xlib apus for postscript and pcl printer a demo be on in colorsoft offer openprint package include a screen capture facility image-processing and support for postscript and non-postscript printer some vendor implementation of x decwindow and openwindow include session manager or other desktop program which include print portion of screen or take a snapshot option some platform also have tool which can be use to grab the frame-buffer directly the sun system for example have a program which produce a sun raster file some x terminal have local screen-dump utility to write postscript to a local serial printer some vendor implementation of lpr sony include direct support for print xwd file but you typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer subject how do i make a color postscript screendump of the x display if you need color postscript in particular you can grab the screen-image use a program which can produce color postscript such a xgrabsc and xv grab the screen-image use xwd and post-proces xwd into color ps you can do thi use or the xtop program from the imagemagick distribution the pbmplu package be also good for thi a be the xim package subject how do i make a screendump include the x cursor thi ca be do unles the x server ha be extend consider instead a system-dependent mechanism for capture the frame-buffer subject how do i image in x the likeliest program be an incarnation of jef poskanzer useful portable bitmap toolkit which include a number of program for convert among variou image format it include support for many type of bitmap gray-scale image and full-color image pbmplu ha be update recently the most recent version be on export in another tool be san

remain simple portable and efficient xtiff illustrate some common problem with build pixmap and use different visual class it be distribute a part of sam leffler libtiff package and it be also available on and db xtiff wa announce in it include xlib and xt version a version of lee iverson leei image-viewing tool be available a on the package also include an imageviewport widget and a filedialog widget some material from larry carroll larryc subject how can i change the titlebar of my xterm window the solution involf send an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager rely upon for the string which appear in the window titlebar a solution be a easy a type thi in an xterm run a shell echo esc where esc be the escape key text be the string you wish to have display and g be a control-g the bel character here be a more complicate csh alia which change the titlebar to the current work directory when you change directory alia newcd echo n esc the digit in these string indicate to xterm that it should change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name use in the icon use the digit instead and use to change only the icon name note another way to do thi which prevent an incorrect display of the local directory if a modify cd be use in a subshell be to wrap the escape sequence into the prompt itself note on an ibm be may be necessary to begin the sequence with a v subject where can i find the xterm control sequence the best source of such information be in ymy source in the file a postscript version be in volume the x user guide include an version of the control sequence the standard volume will be available and a motif version of the book be available now the current guide include an outdated version of the control sequence other good source of information include the version of that document and also the file in the source call a compilation put together by skip montanaro ge cr d list the sequence it date from but be fairly accurate a hardcopy version wa publish in the december xnextevent the xug newsletter in a pinch a manual will do last update subject why do the xterm et al fail against the server subject how can i use character above ascius in xterm in order to use special character such a the o-umlaut you need to stty but also to use a charcell font such a the family be intentionally unspecified in thi example in addition you may want to set thi in ymy shell setenv for a give character above you can determine the key to use with the alt modifier by find the equivalent character below try use man ascius for example o-umlaut v be alt-v and the section character be alt thank to greg holmberg greg thirdi and stephen gildea gildea subject why be my xterm menu so small you be probably set the geometry small accidentally if you give a resource specification like thi then you be ask for all widget under xterm to have their geometry set to for the main window thi be ok a it use character for it size but it popup menu do they be in pixel and show up small to set only the terminal widget to have the specify geometry name it explicitly subject how can i print the current selection you could paste it into an xterm after execute the lpr command however a program by richard hesketh specifically for manipulate the selection will help xselection primary lpr find the primary selection and print it thi command can be place in a window-manager menu or in shell-script xselection also permit the set of the selection and other property a version be on export also available be which can be adapt to do thi subject how do xt use environment variable in load resource you can use several environment variable to control how resource be load for ymy xt-based program xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir these environment variable control where xt look for application-default file a an application be initialize xt load at most one app-default file from the path define in xfilesearchpath and another from the path define in xuserfilesearchpath set xfilesearchpath if software be instal on ymy system in such a way that app-default file appear in several different directory hierarchy suppose for example that you be run sun open window and you also have some x application instal in you could set a value like thi for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up app-default file in both and or wherever ymy openwinhome be locate setenv xfilesearchpath t n t n the value of thi environment variable be a colon-separated list of pathname the pathname contain replacement character a follow see xtresolvepathname n the value of the filename parameter or the application clas name t the value of the file type in thi case the literal string app-default c customization resource only s suffix none for app-default l language locale and codeset l language part of l ja t the territory part of the display language string c the codeset part of the display language string let take apart the example suppose the application clas name be myterm also suppose open window be instal in notice the example omit locale-specific lookup t n mean t n mean a the application initialize xt try to open both of the above app-default file in the order show a soon a it find one it read it and use it and stop look for other the effect of thi path be to search first in then in let consider another example thi time let set xuserfilesearchpath so it look for the file in the current work directory then for myterm in the directory app-default setenv xuserfilesearchpath n the first path in the list expand to the second expand to thi be a convenient set for debug because it follow the imake convention of name the app-default file in the application source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you be work and still have the resource load properly note when look for app-default file with xuserfilesearchpath for some bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix be define so t and s be useles with there another twist you may specify a customization resource value for example you might run the myterm application like thi myterm xrm customization color if one of ymy pathname specification have the value t n c then the expand pathname would be because the c substitution character take on the value of the customization resource the default xfilesearchpath compile into xt be l t n c l t n c t n c l t n l t n t n note some site replace with a projectroot in thi batch of default set the default xuserfilesearchpath also compile into xt be root l n c root l n c root n c root l n root l n root n root be either the value of xapplresdir or the user home directory if xapplresdir be not set if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default xt ignore xapplresdir altogether notice that the quick and dirty way of make ymy application find ymy app-default file in ymy current work directory be to set xapplresdir to a single dot in all thi machinery work differently for compatibilty many person set their xapplresdir value to a dot follow by a slash thank to oliver jone oj subject how to i have the xdm put a picture behind the log-in window the answer ly in change xdm xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before load the resource for example ymy file may add the line false to permit unrestricted acces to the display before log-in beware and also where that file do something for all connection along the line of come in with argument display load display bitmap substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste note that thi be a general hack that can be use to invoke a console window or any other client thank to jay bourland jayb subject why be my path set when xdm run my xsession file when xdm run ymy xsession it do source ymy cshrc or login file you can set the path explicitly a you normally could for any sh script or you can place all environment-setting statement in a separate file and source it from both the xsession file and ymy shell configuration file or if you set ymy path in ymy cshrc file the normal place you can make ymy xsession have path set simply by make it a csh script by start ymy xsession file off with if thi do work also try start off with reset path path csh c path export path subject how do i keep my display when i rlogin to another machine there be several way to avoid have to do a setenv display whenever you log in to another network unix machine run x one solution be to use the on the contrib tape it include xrsh a script to start an x application on remote machine and xrlogin a script to start a local xterm run rlogin to a remote machine a more recent version be on export in one solution be to use the xrlogin program from der mouse mouse you can ftp caveat-emptor version from in and the program package up term and display into a single string which be stuff into term rlogin then propagate term normally ymy cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval xrlogind where xrlogind be a program that check term and if it be of the special format it recognize unpack it and spit out setenv and unsetenv command to recreate the environment variable in addition if all you need to do be start a remote x proces on another host and you find rsh host n display display too simple display must have ymy real hostname then thi version of xrsh can be use to start up remote x process the equivalent usage would be xrsh host xterm start an proces on another host date dec gmt from chri torek chri rsh host n setenv display display exec an improve version rxcmd suggest by john robinson jr generalize for sh ksh by keith boyer keith but they put the rcmd in which leave zombie again thi script combine the best of both case in echo usage host x-cmd arg case shell in csh host shift xhost host rsh host n setenv term xterm setenv display hostname exec sh host shift xhost host rsh host n export term display hostname export display export path path export path exec esac esac subject how can i design my own font one way be to use the bitmap client or some other bitmap-editor sun icon-editor tool post-processed with pbmplu to design the individual character and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate them into the bdf format see ollie jone article in the november x journal for more information the contrib area in and in contain a number of useful utility include some to convert between bdf font format and a simple character format which can be edit with any text editor an easier way be to use the xfed client to modify an exist font a version be on the or contrib tape in xfed be available for anonymou ftp on possibly a file it can produce bdf-format font which can be compile for a variety of x server the xfedor client from group bull permit creation of bitmap cursor pixmap and font binary for common machine be on in pub in addition the source an old xlib implementation have be place in export contrib if you be a metafont user you can use mftobdf from the seetex distribution to convert pk gf and pxl font to bdf format the distribution be on and on the gnu package on include xbfe a font editor and a number of utility for massage font format the x resource issue contain an article on use these tool to modify a font font can be resize with hiroto kagotani bdfresize a new version be in subject why do add a font to the server not work sic after you have build the font use ymy system font-compiler instal it in some directory and run mkfontdir or ymy system equivalent bldfamily for openwindow in that directory be sure to use xset fp dir to add that full path-name to the server font-path or if the directory be already in the path use xset fp rehash so that the new font in that directory be actually find it be thi last step that you probably leave out you can also use xset q to make sure that that directory be in the path sometime ymy xset fp dir command fail with a badvalue error x error of fail request badvalue integer parameter out of range for operation major opcode of fail request thi mean the x server can not find or read ymy font directory or that ymy directory do not look like a font directory to the server the mention of an integer parameter in the message be spuriou is the font directory you specify readable from the server file system remember it the server not the client which interpret ymy font directory trouble in thi area be especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacter in it xset fp myfont and the server be an x terminal or manage by xdm is the directory really a font directory if you run an mit server or most variety of vendor server look in the directory for the file if you ca find that file run mkfontdir if you run openwindow look for the file if you ca find it run bldfamily if you in a site where some person run server and other run a proprietary server with nonstandard font format openwindow for example make sure the font directory be right for the server you use hint if the directory contain pcf snf file it wo work for open window if the directory contain ff fb file it wo work for thank to der mouse mouse and to oliver jone oj subject how do i convert a snf font back to bdf font a tool call snftobdf be part of the bdftool package which be available from and from subject what be a general method of get a font in usable format der mouse getbdf be one solution it connect to a server and produce a bdf file for any font the server be will to let it it can be use a an anything-to-bdf converter but require acces to a server that can understand the font file thu be both more and le powerful than other tool such a snftobdf getbdf be on in or available vium mail from mouse in addition the program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that the server ha acces to subject how do i use decwindow font on my non-decwindow server the decwindow font typically do exist on a non-dec installation but rewrite rule can be use to alia font use by decwindow application to standard mit font of similar characteristic and size pick up the file alias from thi file be for a standard mit server it can also serve a a start point for create a similar alias file for the open window server or other server which do not use the mit font scheme subject how do i add bdf font to my decwindow server the format of font prefer by dec x server be the pcf format you can produce thi compile format from the bdf format by use dec dxfc font-compiler note that the dec server can also use raw bdf font with a performance hit subject how can i set backgroundpixmap in a default file what be xpm i want to be able to do something like thi you ca do thi the backgroundpixmap resource be a pixmap of the same depth a the screen not a bitmap which be a pixmap of depth because of thi write a generic string to pixmap converter be impossible since there be no accept convention for a file format for pixmap therefore neither the x toolkit or the athena widget set define a string to pixmap converter because there be no converter you can not specify thi value a a resource the athena widget set do define a string to bitmap converter for use in many of it widget however courtesy chri d peterson now kit however a specific converter which encapsulate much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by jim frost wa post by sebastian wangnick bastus it permit load of a number of image format a a pixmap the lead general-purpose format for pixmap be the xpm format use by groupe bull in several of it program include the gwm window manager by at t in it olpixmap editor and by ics in it interface builder xpm distribution available on export a include routine which can easily be adapt to converter by new widget which want to allow specification of pixmap resource in the above manner see information on the
