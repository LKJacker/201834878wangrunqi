from garyrich gary rich subject re on a pc and network traffic in article gpatapi write in article support technical support write in article gpatapi write what sort of traffic be generate with the x-call i be curiou to find out the require bandwidth that a link must have if one machine run be support multiple user client and we require adequate response time anyone have any idea i expect the limit factor will be ymy server machine not the network itself to give you a real-world example here at quarterdeck we have roughly person use dvx to talk to a bunch of unix box novell file server and each other it not too much of a load on my ethernet with maybe concentrator so you have person on each segment if you have a badly load net or the app you want to run be very network intensive you could run into some slowdown but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have person run program off it you go to see some slowdown because you now on effectively a mhz of course dvx will attempt to see if task be idle and make sure they give up their time slouse but if you have work program run you know it well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the significant drop in price year after year the link i want to use though isdn be costly and the bandwidth limit that why my interest ly in see if such a link can be use and see what traffic go through it since i do think tom alway get time to read thi group i take the liberty of respond to some of thi if you really want tom to reply you should send mail to support a line be certainly go to restrict you far more than the ethernet that we typically run how restrictive it will be depend on what you run and how you run it i would think that a couple of instance of some really nasty program like smoking clover would make the link useles for anyone else on the other hand probably xclock quietly update every second or so would impact it too much in the real world you will be somewhere in between these two extreme going by the way i personally use x on a daily basi i would want to have to share that link with more than other person having say that if you can tweak the program be run by add in call to give up time slice when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run person on a give machine before you start see slowdown again thi time from network bandwidth hmmm ha anyone at ymy centre monitor the traffic at all are you run any standard ms-window program like word what sort of packet go blaze through what size link do you have or what be the average traffic flow go through ymy network or do you have few high peak and then many low point my corporate wan be a unique a any other the usage pattern be not very good predictor of how your will behave the only one of my low bandwidth link that normally get use in thi way be a link to ireland that they often use to run a do text base client end of a client-server database remotely from the dvx machine behind me since the server end be or wa alway at thi end californium it be faster to remotely run the client vium desqview x and have a short hop to the server than run the client locally and have a long hop to the server a i warn you thi tell u very little about how you usage pattern will fill a isdn link running word for window remotely be go to itself be very usage dependent let break it into piece and look at it tracking the mouse pointer be easy and efficient to translate from window call into x popping up a menu be a little more involve and will generate some traffic restoring the screen that wa cover by that menu may be easy and may not be do the server that it display on have back store if so and the server have enough memory the display can be update locally and will generate little network traffic if no back store then what wa be cover up if it wa a solid color rectangle of space we can tell ymy xserver to draw that quite easily if it wa a full color backdrop of ren stimpy we may have to send it back to the x server bite by bite dvx will do it level best to only redraw that small area but in some unusual case the entire screen may need to be repaint assuning a screen with bite per pixel that bite that ha to be send worst possible case you look at about second in reality it would never be thi bad since the screen will alway have part that will be tranlatable into higher level x call it all really depend on what the program be do ie you go to see a slowdown from x-bandwidth a lot sooner if ymy app be all do network thing also what do you mean by network thing i vision use m window and other window application over the network be the process be run on the server and all i be get be the display i be wonder how good be the x and subsequently protocol in transfer these image with x-call and display them on a client machine x wa design from the grind up to be efficient acros a network it pretty good for thi x program be best do text program be almost a good since we conert them to x easily something like winx be a hybrid we intercept the call window make to it graphic driver mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to x the call window be make be in no way design to be efficient on a packet switch network we go to a lot of trouble to convert them to the highe level xlib call we can but we be somewhat limit because we only know what window and it application tell u quarterdeck office system gary rich problem resolution dept anonymou ftp site for write to info info technical question
