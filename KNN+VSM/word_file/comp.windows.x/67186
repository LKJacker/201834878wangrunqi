from whaley ken whaley subject re animation with xputimage shared memory putimage also mention by nkissebe nick kisseberth look interest but i need someone to point me to some documentation is thi method likely to give better result than server resident pixmap i also be interest in look at the xview code mention above there be no easy answer to thi question it depend on whether the display device can hold pixmap in off-screen memory and if so how efficiently the server manage these resource have to deal with limit off-screen memory be the bane of the server implementor existence i have work with graphic device where the off-screen memory to main display copy rate eclipse that of the main memory to display copy rate and with those where the main memory to display be faster than off-screen to display require only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the follow by a write if ymy server use the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmap in cpu main memory the rate you can get through mit-shm be likely to be equal maybe a tad slower depend on ymy o implementation of share memory to copyarea from pixmap to window which be also then just a copy from cpu main memory to graphic device one advanage of mit-shm be that if ymy image be large you do end up grow the size of the server proces to hold them one disadvantage of the mit-shm be that in it sample implementation there be no provision for elegantly clean up the share memory segment if the client dy a sudden violent death kill you have to be mindful of clutter up the system with zombie share memory segment ken kenneth whaley kubotum pacific computer inc email whaley walsh avenue santum clara ca
