from rryan rob ryan subject efficient pc client we look at variou client for pc and we look for some information about the relative efficiency of different product are any notably efficient fast are any notably inefficient i assume that a graphic accelerator make them significantly faster right now i look at ico run on for window sit on the distinct platform and it not surprisingly much slower than ico run on the console what be the key way of improve performance for pc presumably window client also what about async solution ye i appreciate that it will be much slower even with i in the proces of instal ppp with header compression how do that compare to cslip i see a product call xremote by ncd that promise to be pretty efficient but be there comparable product out there if we look for efficiency for async pc client what should we be look at in addition to standard ppp w compression and xremote any information would be greatly appreciate i still take in all the information in the faq but any tip about the relative efficiency of variou product offer would be great i get the impression that discussion about speed be largely application specific but that not withstand any comment would be appreciate thank rob rob ryan system construct inc rryan
