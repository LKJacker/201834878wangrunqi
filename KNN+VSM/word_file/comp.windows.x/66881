from daniel brad daniel subject re c toolkit direction in article devil gil tene write i be try to figure out the current c toolkit direction more simply i like to know which c toolkit to bet on for use in a new long term project i have the same problem i have look at motif wwl interview gina and a few variation on the above i also do a cursory examination of rogue wave i like abstraction best of all of the toolkit i mention but the result code look little like motif and i have little confidence that thi software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code gina allow you to write code which look a great deal like motif and also make interest use of inheritance but the result code be almost too motif-like and be certainly not significantly le verbose than equivalent c code interview look promise but i have find a free version with motif support and i not confident how widely interview with motif support will be adopt and what if any specific motif support will be available over time the other library produce code which be le motif-like but which do not make sufficient use of the feature of c to simplify my cod task at thi point my inclination be to write my motif manipulation routine in c and invoke those routine from my c code use simple abstraction suit to my specific task later if osf or some credible standards-setting body come up with a c interface to motif i will change to that it do me no goo to write in c if my choice of interface leaf me with code which leaf me tie to an abstraction which be not consistent with the industry direction it better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useles code and useles skill a few year from now be the only library i consider right now but in my environment we end up spend nearly to use it and i ca justify it when it likely to cause short-term productivity decrease a we learn the new abstraction and be unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for u to reap the benefit at the high end of the j curve brad brad daniel if money ca buy happiness daniel i gues i have to rent it i do work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic do speak for my employer
