from mikey mike yang subject re monthly question about xcopyarea and expose event in article buzz buzz moschettus write post of the question that just do seem to get answer how can we resist a question that say something like thi the problem of course be that no expose event be generate if the window be already visible and map what we need to do be somehow tickle the window so that the expose handler be hit with argument that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contain the new item what be the best way to tickle a window to produce thi behavior if ymy expose event handler be truly intelligent about expose rectangle information then you can use xcleararea to generate an expose event assume that ymy background pixel be not none for the enclose rectangle of ymy new item thi be still not great since any other item contain within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn if ymy expose event handler simply redraw everything you be do much more work than just draw the new item on top of the exist scene mike yang silicon graphic inc mikey
