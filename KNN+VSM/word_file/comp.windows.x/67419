from tgl tom lane subject re xv ha escape sherman chri sherman gripe it really bum me out that xv go shareware xv be shareware for about a year have you notice i do have a problem with thi john bradley ha put a hell of a lot of work into xv and if he feel that it time to get some monetary reward from it that surely hi right can the author legally sell xv xv use tiff and jpeg code develop by other did the author get permission to sell these work had you bother to consult the distribution term of the ijg jpeg code which be right there in the xv distribution you would have observe that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware and commercial software sam leffler libtiff copyright also grant permission for unrestricted use include resale my gues be that now nobody be go to want to help the author maintain the code anymore now that xv ha become a commercial product commercial there a big difference between a polite request for a voluntary donation and commercial software i do agree that john readme file could be a little clearer about what he mean by personal use regard tom lane organizer independent jpeg group
