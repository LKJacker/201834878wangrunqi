from buzz buzz moschettus subject monthly question about xcopyarea and expose event post of the question that just do seem to get answer suppose you have an idle app with a realize and map window that contain xlib graphic a button widget when press will cause a new item to be draw in the window thi action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handle regular expose event window manager-driven exposure take care of render the new image using an expose event handler be a proper way to do thi because at the time the handler be call the xlib window be guarantee to be map the problem of course be that no expose event be generate if the window be already visible and map what we need to do be somehow tickle the window so that the expose handler be hit with argument that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contain the new item what be the best way to tickle a window to produce thi behavior
