from sriram sriram srinivasah subject re animation with xputimage in article dcr derek c richardson write hi i new to thi group so please bear with me two year ago i write a sunview application for fast animation of raster file with sunview become rapidly obselete i finally decide to rewrite everything from scratch in xview i put together a quick test and i find that xputimage be considerably slower factor of on average than the sunview command which move image datum from memory pixrect to a canva thi wa on a sparc ipx it seem that the x protocol communication be slow thing down or xputimage be inefficient or both my question be what be the fastest way in to dump plane image datum to a window can i take advantage of the fact that the client be run on the same machine a the server or be i stick with xputimage in which case i might a well give up now all help appreciate thank derek the fastest way be to use an x server with share memory extension it use share memory if it be a local x server hence image do have to be duplicate and default to the regular image routine if either the share mem extension be not available or if it not the localhost sriram
