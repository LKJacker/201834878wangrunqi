from gnohmon ralph betza subject dynamic squeezetitle configuration in twm i consider twm-style squeezed title indispensable in a window manager i like to have two tall xterm window visible at the same time with no overlap and since two window be enough i have other xterm window underneath them with exactly the same position in case you not familiar with squeezed title here a crude picture figure title a title b title c thi be the window b hide window c but body of the you can still see c title window window a which be squeeze right figure squeezed title allow me to have about such window in each stack with easy acces and per stack be usually more than i really need since i also insist on have a virtual wm the only problem be that the title location be static that be it be configure in twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager doing so be cumbersome and time-consuming therefore i have implement leave center right function in my own copy of vtwm the idea be that with one click of a button you can change thi title a thi be the body of the window window a to thi title a thi be the body of the window window a okay so far so good now how the heck do i get them to put thi into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm and the next ctwm and the next xyztwm that i never hear of one way would be to post in a description of thi enhancement together with an explanation of why i think it be a very good thing and hope that someone read it in case it be already clear why i think it a very good thing look back up at figure and picture window a move over on top of window b and c now window a title hide window b title but when you hit the result be title b title a title c thi be the body of the window window a which be on top the rest of thi post explain how to implement it base on my copy of it just a sketch because post the full diff would be too long the key to thi enhancement be to add the follow line in the executefunction routine in ifdef shape case static squeezeinfo if deferexecution context func scr selectcursor return true setframeshape break and similarly for squeezeright and squeezecenter endif of course you also have to define in and add fkeyword and so forth to in order to use these function add something like the follow to ymy twmrc file m s about a year ago i post thi but my news wa break and i think it do get out since then blast ha appear in volume issue you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by chisel away at an mwm-style wide title better to have a twm-style window manager i think ralph betza fm uunet ssiny gnohmon gnohmon the question of whether a computer can swim be more interest than the question of whether a submarine can think lenny dykstra
