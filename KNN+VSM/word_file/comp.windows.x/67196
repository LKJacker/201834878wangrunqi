from toml tom lastrange subject re repost in article trevor trevor bourget ignite write in sdenni write i post thi a while ago and do receive one reply and now we have another bug report on the same subject can anybody help me out the problem be that motif use xgrabkey to implement menu accelerator and these grab be specific about which modifier apply unfortunately the specification for xgrabkey do allow anymodifier to be combine with other modifier which be exactly what would be desire in thi case ctrl any key q in ora vol in the section on accelerator it say for information on how to specify translation table see vol thi be so you know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource if you go to vol it say likewise if a modifier be specify there be nothing to prohibit other modifier from be present a well for example the translation shift key q quit will take effect even if the ctrl key be hold down at the same time a the shift key and the q key thi be true for accelerator and mnemonic which be implement use event handler instead of grab it not true for menu accelerator if you a motif implementor i suggest lobby to get the xlib semantic change to support the feature i describe above otherwise change the documentation for menu accelerator to properly set the user expectation because menu accelerator be not the same thing a translation is it possible to supply accelerator for a menu entry if you mean menu accelerator no it not possible that accord to the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page keep in mind when answer thi question that when use motif you ca use xtinstallaccelerator i ca think of a reason why not how can you ensure that accelerator work the same independent of case what i want be and to both be accelerator on one menu entry i find thi thread on motif accelerator absoultly amaze if i be write an interface to keyboard accelerator i would have one resource call accelerator that take a translation table period i would also implement it so that programmer never ha to do any work to get the accelerator instal a soon a the end-user specify one it would be active and automatically instal to get multiple accelerator on a single menu item i do something like override n ctrl key m fire n shift key l fire n the accelerator would work exactly like translation and you would automatically see a ctrl m show up in ymy menuitem object why in the world be the motif stuff so complicate with so many different special case depend on what type of widget you deal with there ha to be some reason sorry for the political tone of thi message tom lastrange toml
