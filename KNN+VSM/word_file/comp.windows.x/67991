from jc john chamber subject paint with increase resolution some person work a few cube over have come up with thi need and it seem that someone out there just might have do it already and can point me to some tool that would help what they like to do be given a window that be take a long time to draw because either the datum be arrive over a slow link or the display be acros a slow link they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of the picture and then repaint it in higher resolution thu the picture might first be generate in resolution with each square of pixel be fill in with a single color next each square would be replace by square finally the version would be paint since one of the scenario be with the window be on the other side of a slow link the low-re version obviously would be transmit a a bitmap that would help at all instead there would have to be a proces on the far end that receife the low-re picture a a small bitmap and blow up each pixel into a square sortum like the magnifier program do thi bring up the question of whether the x server can help that be when a window be open be there a way to ask that a filter program be run to proces the pixel or be the only way to use something like rsh to start up a remote proces permission deny and have it open a local window it seem the most likely scenario be a library routine that start up such a program remotely and then accept bitmap compress each one by some amount and send them to the remote program to expand but if there be something that x itself can do to help it be nice to hear about it i look in several fm but if it there i obviously do know the keyword if someone ha a nifty tool available that package it all we might want to get a copy oh ye thi be to run on some sun part of the idea be to build demo that can show such thing a if thi be run acros say a link thi be how fast the picture would appear then the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for if the auto industry be like the computer industry a car would now cost would get mile to the gallon and at random time would explode kill all it passenger
