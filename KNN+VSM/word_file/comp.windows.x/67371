from bnoble brian noble subject x server scanline pad question i be almost do port to a new piece of display hardware but have run into a snag i think may be somewhat commonplace so i send a net-feeler i have a display that be a non-interlaced memory map display the server view of the world obtain vium xwd xwud seem to be exactly what it should be however the display version of the framebuffer gife the impression that the server be use scanline that be too long after a bite of experimentation it seem that the problem wa that the server wa pad the line out to a word boundry but the scanline size in the buffer be byte which be exactly divisible by fmy changing the follow define in define define define to define define define wa not exactly the right solution how do i tell the server either a do pad the scan line at all thi server be only be build to run on thi particular display or to pad only to byte boundry i use a customize version of under mach thank brian
