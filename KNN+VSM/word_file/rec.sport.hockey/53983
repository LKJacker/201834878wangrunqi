from mep marko poutiainen subject re team wa nhl expansion finland d-jyrki lumme d-teppo numminen d-peter ahola well well they do like my defender mainly lumme and numminen c-jarus kurrus c-christian now do you think that ruuttu be only worth i think it might be r-teemu selanne compared to kurrus selanne point be too high let make it or well in the canada cup and world championship largely due to the effort of marku ketterer the goalie or the player list above and luck there presumably a lot of decent player in finland that would be superstar at the highest level but still valuable role player however my gues would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a team in the nhl wow now it look like you do like my player what about guy like nieminen jutila riihijarvus varvio laukkanen makela keskinen and even if he be age ruotsalainen the main difference between finnish and north american player be that my player tend to be better in the larger rink the canadian defender be usually slower that defender in europe and i think that there wa more in my succes than ketterer and luck though they help i think that the main reason wa that the team work well together howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh prostetnic vogon jeltz marko poutiainen mep
