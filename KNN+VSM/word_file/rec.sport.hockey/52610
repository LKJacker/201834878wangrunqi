from mjacque michael jacque subject re playoff prediction in article boudreau carol v boudreau write in the smythe thi one be the toughest for me to call because i have to put personal bia aside go calgary i think a lot depend on who win the division winnipeg will move into third by the end of the season and the first place winner will have a clear advantage it will be a lot easier to build momentum against a team like the king whoever play the king in the first round will take the division much a it hurt i have to pick division winner vancouver canuck i have to disagree with you on thi one i think vancouver will go a bure go and if he continue on hi goal score slump then they wo even make it out of the first round i think the king will make it out of the first round regardles of who they play they seem to be do pretty well even with that bad game against minnesotum on saturday i think it be either calgary or lo angele to win the smythe go on to the conference final wale conference trophy islander and bruin will fight to the end but i think the islander have enough steam to overtake the bruin in seven campbell conference trophy a walk for vancouver maybe in or but definately not stanley cup final islander and vancouver islander will have nothing leave by thi point and will succumb fairly easily to the canuck stanley cup champion vancouver canuck still have to disagree with you here i think it be pittsburg to get the hat trick in stanley cup they just look toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good i hope you have enjoy my prediction i hope they be not all correct go calgary neither do i well may the best team win it all pittsburg that just my worth message from the terminal of carol boudreau boudreau
