from jame david subject plu minu stat post of newsgroup from maynard roger maynard subject re plu minu stat organization dept of computer science laurentian university sudbury on date frus apr gmt discussion delete good for you you only be display ymy ignorance of course but to each hi own roger i not sure here but i think ignorance be really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulate an opinion but hey if you need to take a cheap shoot then by all mean go ahead that if it make you feel better to knowledgeable observer of the game my mean be obviou ymy hockey education be not my responsibility my hockey education what the f be you talk about i not even go to try to refute thi absolutely insane statement my word such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey why do he bother you so much he wa an effective player for hi style of play he wa just another player to laud him a anything more i find bothersome i hat the hab i hat lafleur until i realize that he wa likely the most aesthetically please player to ever skate in my lifetime why would anyone talk about gainey i hate the hab you sound like a old thi statement be just further exemplify ymy total inability to argue objectively about hockey do give me thi crap about cogent argument i yet to read something of your that be cogent you consistently argue with emotion huge sweep statement frankly you have a very unconvincing style i not defend bob gainey frankly i do care for him all that much but ymy dismissal of him a something le than an effective hockey player be tiresome it ha no basi in anything how many calder do he win i think it wa fmy go ahead and refresh my memory what about the conn smythe wa that a fluke yeah not the make of a hockey superstar i know but try to have a reason any reason to shoot him down go around who would you rather have a ymy check centre doug gilmmy or doug jarvi for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario a my check centre do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey i really sorry roger but you have lose me completely here why do you ask me if i would rather have jesu christ himself in net did he play hockey at a high level wa he any good if not why would you bother to bring jc up i be talk about hockey player here if you ca follow the conversation do follow up a i say previously it be not my responsibility to educate you hey cowboy you the expert who introduce the idiotic comparison of gainey with gretzky and lemieux you figure it out now if you be to compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have a balance comparison sure two journeyman big deal neither one of them be worth discuss how many individual award between them eight i do remember once again please feel free to refresh my memory and try to be a sarcastic a possible about my hockey education i wrong again hmmm let see where wa i wrong in the i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter oh my god did i say that roger what ymy point fuhr be a goaltender goaltender do plug in hi prime he wa one of the best sanderson wa a scrapper if you stick him on you may a well include half the flyer team of the same era first place i only guess here rog but i have a feel that you setup a you wrong again macro key on ymy machine that be an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time respond to any of ymy or greg post then i will be sure to implement that very macro oh roger you should really i do deserve thi you be far too accomodating already i would suggest that ymy comment and when the pres run out of thing to say about the star on dynasty they start to hype the plugger grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvi derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henrus richard dick duff and so on demonstrate a blanket disregard for these individual a contributor to the game so ye settle down nobody ha claim that they be hockey god tarasov claim that gainey wa a hockey god and greg eat it up and that be what thi thread be all about if you do know that then why be you respond you seem to have allow all of these other player fall into ymy sweep vacuou statement that why if you want to debate gainey go ahead but why bring up everybody else how do it support ymy argument do you have an argument or do you just like to throw around a few name hop to impres u and a for blanket disregard for these individual i can remember leaf team purely populate by such individual win fmy stanley cup team no one run around tell u that george armstrong wa the best hockey player in the world great i could agree more the flyer win two cup for the same reason deservedly so so what i do get it are you angry that the leaf do get more recognition you seem to think these plugger be hype i do agree plain and simple if you last statement be some sort of compromise fair enough you might consider develop ymy own style after all imitation be the sincerest form of flattery and i be quite sure that flattery be not ymy intention it ha a nice ring to it and admit it you have a good laugh right i have to get to the end of ymy post before i realize you be a complete joke not a pleasant bone in ymy body eh rog why be you so unhappy not get invite to enough party what in the future if you be go to respond to my post i would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument support by fact glean from a version of reality that most of the rest of u would recognize roger why be you under the impression that respond to ymy post be some great honmy you really should stop it sound a little bite pathetic frankly it about a honourable a a good fart congenially a alway jd jame david jame david western busines school london ontario
