from keith scott alan subject hockey coverage thi be a general question for u reader how extensive be the playoff coverage down there in canada it be almost impossible not to watch a series on tv ie the only two series i have not have an opportunity to watch thi year be wash-nyi and chi-stl the latter because i in the wrong time zone we in canada be basically swamp with coverage and i wonder how many be televise nationally or even locally in the u and how much precedence they take over say local news if the game go into double-ot email me so a not to waste bandwidth please my news fee be kind of slow anyway
