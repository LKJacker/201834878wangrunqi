with the unflux of european but feel that they must make sure exist franchise be stable seemed to like the idea of play in the olympic booo but say that there wa a definite split among owner and that thi certainly would only happen in fmy year if there wa a consensu the sabre give the flyer their second power play of the game when brad may take a trip penalty at of the second the flyer have a little trouble get start but eventually do hawgood take a pa a he wa move throug the neutral zone and hand the puck to eklund just outside the sabre blue line along the right board eklund carry into the zone nad pass acros to dineen who try a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the leave circle he half fan on it and send the puck trickle through the slot fuhr do know where it wa though and hawgood win the race to it and flip it into essentially an open net at then mogilny on a breakaway he slip through two flyer at the blue line and go in on soderstrom he go with the backhander but soderstrom wa all over it the flyer then take some bad discipline type penalty that really hurt them viacheslav butsayev take a double minor for rough and high stick when barnaby get under hi skin and draw one minor then accord to gary dornhoefer take a dive to get the other there wa no video at the sabre coudl get start ryan mcgill poke at the puck just after a sabre carry into the flyer zone and after a bunch of person poke at it dineen emerge with it and head the other way it start out a on but hustle ahead to make it a on and back off the defenseman dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it flyer at that wa all for fuhr john muckler send in dominik hasek to take over but the sabre still have lot of power play time again they take some time to just get into the flyer zone and when they finally do the flyer be all over them boo begin to ring through the build but they finally get through soderstrom on an ugly goal smehlik take a shoot from the top of the zone that miss and kick out to hawerchuk in the slot hawerchuk try a backhander a he skate toward the goal line to the right a galley dive down to block it mistake he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worry about a the rebound or b barnaby who wa camp behind the goal line right next to the net well the rebound drop right next to soderstrom and mistake galley just lay there and watch barnaby get three hack at the puck before he finally push it through the goalie he do even swing hi stick out to try and knock the puck away with the goal at two streak end for the flyer of shutout hockey and straight penalty kill lindro put them right back on the power play at with a high stick minor i think it wa barnaby again thi time the sabre be able to get set up quickly but could get too much quality on goal the sabre continue to keep the puck in the flyer end for a while after the power play end thing evetually settle down but then the other very bad penalty mcgill allow barnaby to get under hi skin and slash hi stick just before a faceoff the glove be drop and mcgill start pound the crap out of him but during the fight he give barnaby a head butt with hi helmet and that mean a match penalty for slash fight and for the major minute of power play time for the sabre at barnaby only get the flyer be keep them at bay for a while but there wa only so long they could do that after a couple of good sabre chance audette hand to ledyard at the point and ledyard send a drive that wa knock down by soderstrom lafontaine whack at the bounce puck from the leave side of the net and knock it over to randy wood at the right soderstrom have move over to play lafontaine and since yushkevich and carkner be wave at the puck instead of pick up man wood just slide it into the empty net at to close the flyer lead to lafontaine wa actually try to put it on net but half fan on it and get a break the flyer then get some shorthanded pressure in the sabre zone but hasek wa strong finally it wa keith carney pass ahead to hawerchuk into the neutral zone and hawerchuk send a good backhand pa to mogilny at the flyer blue line another mini-breakaway for mogilny he elect to shoot from the leave circle and he thread the needle to get it just inside the far post at for hi of the season ironically the youth hockey tip between the and second period wa tommy soderstrom talk about cut off angle that wa all in the shoot be sabre into the period and pelle eklund blow a golden opportunity to get the flyer the lead back a on acton with the puck he drop to eklund in the slot and eklund hold the puck a he slide through the leave circle until he have almost no angle at all to shoot from when he finally do shoot he hit the far post that wa still during the carryover power play time than an incredible almost goal randy wood skate around recchi and hawgood untouched into soderstrom soderstrom go down wood poke the puck under soderstrom and a black object hit the back of the net red light come on horn sound crowd cheer but up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be review well it turn out that it wa the tap up stick blade that go into the net not the puck emrick mention that one of the criterium for score a goal be that the puck must go into the net dave hannan then take out recchi and get a hold minor at the flyer could not get anything go at all they finally get set up way through but be keep on the perimeter a time run out beranek strip the puck from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right board and pass it acros to eklund at the top of the leave circle eklund saw dineen head at the net just inside the right circle and pass through to him dineen fumble the pa but twice direct it at hasek and eklund swoop in and chip the bounce puck over the goalie for hi at flyer but the sabre come right back lafontaine pick up the puck in hi offensive leave corner and slide it to bob erry behind the flyer net erry start to skate out but then just drop the puck back to nobody behind the net mogilny fly in skate around and stuff it through soderstrom hole for hi at to tie the game at then hawerchuk take a retaliatory rough penalty at the flyer set up in the sabre zone and stay there off a faceoff high in the sabre zone in the middle while wrestle for the puck dineen sneak through the line and wristed a perfect shoot low to hasek glove side at play start to go back and forth until hawgood take a rough penalty at the flyer dump the puck into the sabre zone and ledyard go after it and rod get the puck he back away from the right board skate to the right faceoff dot and pass between hi leg to dineen crash through the slot all by himself dineen wait patiently and lift it over the blocker of hasek for a flyer lead at hat trick of the season for dineen of hi career shorthanded goal of the game for him of the season then carney take a trip penalty at to kill the rest of the sabre power play not much action on the on and the sabre get most of the chance on the flyer result power play play go end to end for quite a while after that and both goaly have to make some big save the sabre be able to pull hasek a time wa run out a the flyer would allow any consistant possession for the sabre finally a time wa run out ken sutton misplay the puck in hi own leave corner and strip it away from him he pull away and find dineen on the other side of the leave circle and dineen find acton at the right of hasek he slide the puck between two sabre defender and acton chip it back to the far side of hasek for hi of the season at on hi birthday that wa all the score shoot be buffalo and the ice wa shower with plastic drink mug hand out before the game so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who have be test much in hi last couple of start kevin dineen ha a career high point night unles he have a better night earlier in the season but i do think so the flyer longest win streak in year goal for only against with three shutout eric lindro be in league with even strength goal despite miss game with injury point out of clinch place since the ranger lose the tie breaker a couple misc note forget the mike keenan rumor there will be a pres conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the new york ranger next year in the last note i mention that garry galley win the barry ashbee award but i fail to mention that the award be for the best defenseman the time of trenton ha report that a preeminent specialist from oklahoma ha look over tommy soderstrom medical record and determine that no further test be necessary in the near future same paper have a blurb about bill dineen be ask about whether
