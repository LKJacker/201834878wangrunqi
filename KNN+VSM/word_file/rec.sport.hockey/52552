from jbarrett jonathan barrett subject re thi year biggest and worst opinion i can only comment on the king but the most obviou candidate for pleasant surprise be alex zhitnik he come highly tout a a defensive defenseman but he clearly much more than that great skater and hard shoot though wish he be more accurate in fact he pretty much allow the king to trade away that huge defensive liability paul coffey kelly hrudey be only the biggest disappointment if you think he wa any good to begin with but at best he only a mediocre goaltender a better choice would be toma sandstrom though not through any fault of hi own but because some thug in toronto decide to threaten hi career in order to avoid concede a goal other than that the award go to robert lang an uninspiring czech robitaille could easily be mvp but i prefer to give it to rob blake who be quietly become one of the league premier defenseman and if the king manage to hold onto him and the rest of my young defense it could one day mean that we let in fewer goal than hartford honorable mention to majestic marty and warren rychel jon
