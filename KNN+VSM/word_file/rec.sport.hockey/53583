from seth subject flyer note the flyer close out the season last night with their straight victory a ot winner over the hartford whaler the ot game winner come from dimitrus yushkevich just hi of the season and hi first game winner the flyer never lead up until that point in the game for the whaler the los mark an nhl record ot los thi season roster move gord hyne wa call to to play in place of ryan mcgill injury ryan mcgill injure hi hand in a fight and wa scratch line eklund-lindros-recchi lomakin-butsayev-conroy faust-acton-brown galley-bowen yushkevich-hawgood carkner-hyne dominic roussel game summary i do get tv coverage of the game and since it wa stormy in these part i do have the best radio coverage either here the box score follow by a few thing i do pick up first period hartford nylander philadelphium recchi lindro pp penalty verbeek har hold carkner phi rough houda har interference second period hartford burt cunneyworth kron philadelphium bowen eklund recchi hartford nylander zalapski sanderson penalty galley phi major-game misconduct spear verbeek har major-game misconduct spear brown phi trip zalapski har trip phi slash third period hartford kron sanderson cassel pp philadelphium beranek lomakin yushkevich philadelphium faust roussel penalty houda har trip hawgood phi hold overtime philadelphium yushkevich faust penalty none power play philadelphium of hartford of goaly philadelphium roussel shoot save hartford lenarduzzi on the first hartford goal gord hyne misplay the puck at the flyer blue line and nylander strip him and take off the recchi goal wa a on with lindro the bowen goal wa just a puck he throw at the net get a good carom and it end up behind the goalie on the second nylander goal he get three whack at the puck before it go in thi be the most frustrate part of the flyer defense take the body and if they get one shoot and beat you fine do give them another chance carkner galley and mcgill be all terrible about thi i bet money at least one of them wa the closest flyer to the play that all i have my radio get bad after that and i wa lucky to know who it wa that score much le how from what i hear roussel have a very strong game after the game gene hart ask bobby taylor to pick the three star of the season rather than of the game it wa garry galley for hi career high point total i surprise that a former goalie would look closer at hi defensive play tommy soderstrom for hi team record tie shutout in only about a season and mark recchi for hi all time high team single season score mark but here the odd part he could decide between lindro and recchi for number if he pick recchi a after he have a hard time choose between him and lindro do that make lindro what you wan na know my three star of the season well since you ask eric lindro eric dominate a game simply by step out onto the ice the difference between the team record with him and without him be no accident i believe that the team could have be almost a successful without recchi there be no question that thi team be significantly better with eric lindro on it and i think that he will deservedly wear the on hi jersey next season tommy soderstrom shutout wa second in the league to only ed belfmy and tommy do have a chri chelio booo in front of him he also do play a complete season due to heart problem sentimental edge here my family ha a history of heart problem there no question in my mind that tommy soderstrom be thi team goalie of the future and if roussel complain again about be number look for him to be trade within year mark recchi again you ca argue with an all-time team high single season score mark there be an awful lot of team that do have a single player get a many point plu mark be the only flyer to play the entire season not a tough choice honorable mention rod top hi single season high point total which he set last year the difference wa that he wa on the top line thi year and do get a much play time then again he do get the defensive attention that he get last year from the other team either dimtrus yushkevich wa the team most consistent defenseman ye he make rookie mistake but he wa usually fast enough to make up for them i have a feel that with hi shoot he score a few more point next year without give up anything in hi own zone and i suspect that he be the team top defenseman in year to come garry galley wa the team point leader from defenseman again there be some thing you just ca argue with and he battle with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserve kudo for only miss one game and that wa against hi wish under doctor order but hi defensive play often negate hi offensive contribution a little more caution and a little bite smarter in hi own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year brent fedyk wa the league biggest improvement over last year point total but consistency become a problem for him a couple misc note mostly for mail list member
