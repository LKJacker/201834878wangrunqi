from maynard roger maynard subject re hawk v leaf lastnight in golchowy gerald olchowy write in article raj ramnarace write do anyone else see thi game last night just like a playoff game lot of hit but i wa disappoint by the video goal judge on all replay joe murphy goal should have count it do go in net and accord to the tsn broadcaster the video goal judge say that he saw the water bottle on top of the cage move so he assume the puck go in thi be terrible hope crap like thi do occur in the playoff the game would have end in tie i think the red light go on thu in the review the presumption would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck do not go in the net from the replay i say even from the rear the evidence wa conclusive that the puck wa in or out in my opinion it seem pretty conclusive to me the puck clearly hit the crossbar and then come down on the line and the announcer admittedly homer keep harp about how they must have have a different view upstair because it wa obviou to them and i would have think to anyone who saw the replay that the puck do go in the referee originally signal no goal but the video replay judge initiate contact with the referee to claim that a goal wa in fact score thi to me be unheard of seeing stuff like thi happen gife me a bad feel about the leaf chance thi year cordially a alway rm roger maynard maynard
