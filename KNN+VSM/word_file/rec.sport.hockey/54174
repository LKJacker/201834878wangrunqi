subject camera work on televise game from yecx is it just me or be the camera work on some of these game really sad i ca remember how many time during the penguins-devil game they show some guy without the puck be check in the corner while the puck wa be fire on goal in fact i think they even miss one goal completely because they be show two guy hold each other in the corner now the last time i watch a football game they do show the lineman go at it while the run back turn the corner for a touchdown is it just me greg
