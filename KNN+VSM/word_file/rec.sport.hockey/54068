from allan allan sullivan subject oiler rummy team move pres conference next week i hear a story on the local sport news broadcast in edmonton oiler owner peter pocklington will be hold a pres conference next week while the exact detail be not know it be believe to concern the oiler future rummy ha it that pocklington sign a tentative lease arrangement with copp collesium in hamilton during the pres conference pocklington may announce the deal it be quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northland to renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium northland ha offer to buy the oiler for million earlier but the offer wa reject immediately by pocklington a for me my opinion be divide edmonton ha be fairly supportive of the oiler even though they a small market team they have many sellout in the even with the problem that the team have thi year they still bring in more fan than many team in larger city do on the other hand if the team do move there be no place more deserve than hamilton of course how would that affect the grand realignment scheme of bettman
