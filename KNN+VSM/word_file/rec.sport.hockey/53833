from steve steve cole subject re shark kingston fired in article snichol sherrus nichol write in article terry terry wong write i think that jack ferreira fire eventually lead to kingston fire you mention consistency of vision i think the shark lose that with the los of ferreira there ha never be a head that ha ever work you need one person make the personnel decision at the top not management by committee the conventional wisdom from around the league be that ferreira would have make the move that would have field a better product on the ice how exactly would ferreira accomplish thi the three-headed gm-ship ha take a lot of heat but nobody explain how thing would have be any different have ferreira still be there would ferreira have make more trade who would have he have trade would he have make fewer trade who should not have be trade i think the three-headed gm guide principle wa to keep veteran in favor of youngster only if they offer a significant advantage at the end of last season the contract of several veteran with somewhat maginal contribution fenton bozek anderson and a couple other i ca remember be buy out the idea wa that youngster could play almost a well and have the potential to improve where these older guy do not and they trade mullen because he want to go not because he wa good enough but i think they be a bite too optimistic in think they could make up for hi contribution an example from thi season skriko wa bring in on a trial basi but not keep because of hi age i think he wa a decent contributor worth keep around the youth movement ha it advantage look at gaudreau who might still be in kc if more veteran have be keep around but you have to find the right balance steve cole steve apple sep steve department of geophysic stanford university stanford ca
