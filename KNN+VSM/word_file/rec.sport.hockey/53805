the rest of the week we only have about five minute to talk and we agree we get back together later around noon and talk some more q senator dole say over the weekend that ymy compromise be no compromise the president well i know he do but look senator dole and a lot of the other republican now in the senate vote for the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in and my research indicate that a majority of them over time vote for a total of emergency spend measure total over billion when reagan and bush be president in those administration and many of those purpose be not nearly a worthy a put the american person back to work i do want to go back and revisit every one but you can do it you can look at the research there so thi position they take be not credible we have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan all these cost be cover during that time and then some and the very person that be say thi ha all get to be pay for do have much of a history on which to base their position they get year of vote for stimulu measure of thi kind that have very little to with put the american person back to work so i think we get a chance to work it out and i hopeful we see what
