from cubrj brian johnson subject the hawk will return to the final well now that the hawk have win the division the road be a little easier for the playoff let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while chicago sweep that just make it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and get none for the conf champ they will have a hard time versu the division but that div will be pretty batter also so the advantage go to the hawk again then bring pitt and sure the hawk will probably lose but it better to get that far and lose than to not go brian
