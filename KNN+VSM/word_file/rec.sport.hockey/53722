from mlindroo marcu lindroo inf subject team wa nhl expansion in tervio write now what if the two team be merge thi ha be propose in tampere with ilf lynx and tappara axe the fan would take it they rather see their team out of the playoff most of the time or even relegate than merge it not that difficult to understand it just like here in helsinki you grow up be either a jokerit or hifk fan the other team be the last team in the world you would support i not talk about but about extremely deeply root rivalry deeply root rivalry ahem jokerit have be around since and join the top flight only in the early helsingfor ifk have be around since but fan only start take hockey seriously in the so i think you exagerating here however it be prove that both fan group can cheer the same team that the finnish national team maybe that how you could set up a huge franchise in finland no one ha ever say that the team must be call after one city or play all it game on one arena just one team finland and team sweden in the nhl just would make any sense we have way more talent than of the total of north american talent after a couple of season you would never see the cup go anywhere outside the nordic presume that my team would have the advantage in draft local talent a prooposed that a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the canadian american olympic team have be and they have to play accord to my set of rule and on international ice the olympic team contain about a much talent a ymy average expansion team canada have eric lindro sean burke joe juneau and chri konto another fmy or five have be deep sub in the nhl a for the yank keith tkachuk scott lachance bret hedican shawn mceachern steve heintze ted donato joe sacco and bill guerin have be line player in the nhl while robb stauber ha do well for the king in goal nothing more in fact i sure that an all-star team assemble from the best finnish league team would do no better in the nhl than hartford or tampa bay currently be do but what happen if all top-clas finnish swedish player gradually end up with helsinki stockholm a the north american-based one gradually retire and no team be allow to draft new player from scandinavium here be what the hockey news scout think of my nhl-based player regular regular player finland d-jyrki lumme d-teppo numminen d-peter ahola c-jarus kurrus c-christian r-teemu selanne l-esa tikkanen obviously selanne rat would be higher today than they be in january sweden d-ulf samuelsson d-fredrik d-nikla lidstrom d-calle johansson d-kjell d-tommy sjodin d-tommy albelin c-mat sundin c-thoma steen r-thoma r-ulf dahlen r-michael l-per-erik eklund l-johan garpenlov l-mikael l-jan erixon thi would be interest clearly finland top five player winnipeg selanne numminen vancouver lumme lo angele jarus kurrus and new york tikkanen be right up there with any five-man unit pittsburgh co have but i have my doubt about the home-based finnish player the national team do well in the canada cup and world championship largely due to the effort of marku ketterer the goalie or the player list above and luck there presumably a lot of decent player in finland that would be superstar at the highest level but still valuable role player however my gues would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a team in the nhl sweden be easier to judge because they have more player in north america their point total player be seven more than ottawa top player combine if we estimate there be six more nhl regular back home in sweden an all-swedish team would assemble about skill point deducting some point from pittsburgh ny ranger and other team that rely on swedish player the swedish team would finish in sixth place about a high a boston vancouver calgary and montreal on paper so the dynasty talk be completely unfounded here an team might have an advantage because the player would be play at home half of the time wo have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably play the wide-open european variant of hockey rather than have to learn the north american check game however if free agency become a factor the top scandinavian player still might end up play for large-market team after a couple of year the same way edmonton dynasty crumble in the late some fringe player likely will be draft by other nhl team a have an exclusive talent pool might be a bite unfair after all i settle for a compromise prohibit all european team from sign a north american during the first two round but allow them to keep their top two player after thi the amateur draft should be open to anyone j o o j o o j o k e r i t finland over czech in the final b r u i n p o w e r bruin over blackhawk in marcu
