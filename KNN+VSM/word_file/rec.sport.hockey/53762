from gballent greg ballentine subject re wing will win in article ragraca randy a graca write gballent greg ballentine write in article ragraca randy a graca write i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they face them in the final which be what all the detroit sportswriter be predict although i think bryan murray be probably the best gm i have ever see in hockey how do you figure that when bryan murray take over the wing they be a pretty good team that wa contend for the stanley cup but look unlikely to win it now they be a pretty good team that be contend for the stanley cup but look unlikely to win it a truly great gm would have be able to make the move to push the team to the upper echelon of the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup a good gm like murray can maintain the team succes but ca push them to the next level when jacque demer bring the wing to the conference final twice a few year back he have everyone on the team give percent but he have very little talent he have yzerman bob probert who have drink problem at the time and a couple of decent goaltender in hanlon and stefan who get hot that about it can you name one player on those earlier team who even deserve to be in the all-star game much le actually get there other than yzerman and probert like petr klima give me a break when they face edmonton in both of those conference final a hard a they play it wa clear they face a team that simply have superior talent to the wing that why they could not get to the final also at that time the norri division wa still the weakest division in hockey and get past chicago and toronto wa not a impressive a it be today murray ha bring score talent to the wing that they do not have a few year ago when devellano wa gm and demer wa coach to name a few ysebaert kozlov and paul coffey who ha make a definite positive impact on the power play especially murray ha build one of the most talented team in hockey at the present with the possible exception of the pittsburgh penguin the wing have at least five goal scorer that i can think of and a couple of defenseman with over game worth of playoff experience murray one fail be that unlike the other gm you mention who be definitely also good do get me wrong he ha not find for himself a strong coach to motivate the team to go out and give percent for the full minute every night like they do the last time they make a cup run when a team win or losis it a reflection of the gm and the coach which wa the point of my original post if the team outmatch their opponent in term of talent but losis anyway which ha be the case thi year when the wing have struggle that indicate that the gm ha do hi job in build up the team but the coach ha fail to motivate them if a in the case of the last run the wing make in the playoff before murray come they give opponent a hard time who should have beat them easily that indicate good coach make up for a lack of talent all of thi be fine i never say that murray wa a bad gm i merely say that he be the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor if murray be a great a you claim the wing would have win the stanley cup by now probably more than once if he wa a great a gm a you claim and he wa a poor a coach a you claim he would have be intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of succes but murray be an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm so none of thi be true anyway gregmeister
