from spiegel mark spiegel subject re shark kingston fired in article nlu nelson lu write in article spiegel mark spiegel write in article nlu nelson lu write i say gund will have to open hi checkbook i do say give up any draft pick or promise talent if we could have get murphy for the great but i agree the shark should give up young talent or early round draft pick i list chelio et al only to indicate the type of player i think the shark need to pick up the rule on sign free agent le than year old put a big restriction on what the shark can pick up however i do believer they need to pick up some player who will add toughnes to the team but you have to remember that you unlikely to get any real quality free agent who do not require compensation the shark try with makarov who wa probably the top of the clas among non-compensation free agent but even he probably would have help too much do expect to get top quality just some toughnes i do view makarov a a player who would add toughnes size hopefully wo be much of a worry next year alexander cherbayev and michal sykora have agree to multi-year contract and it appear that mike rathje will also sign soon all three be pretty big size alone be enough we all know how much fear kolstad strike in the eye of opponent not well rathje and sykora be both highly tout prospect unlike kolstad and cherbayev wa initially suppose to play for the russian wc team anybody know what happen there that mean that he likely to be good enough nelson you confuse skill and toughnes johan garpenlov would you really rather have those two instead of johan by ymy logic then you enjoy have falloon and ozolinsh on injure reserve by ymy logic then you think that if the shark have keep mcgill and hammond that you can guarantee that falloon and ozolinsh would have get hurt think again there wa a chance that mcgill would have cause ozolinsh to get stick at kc and a you know hammond be worthles and mcgill be almost worthles well wilson maybe but i do think falloon and ozolinsh be really injure on cheapshot who say they be if they be then i do see any justification that have mcgill and hammond around would prevent their injury if the injury of falloon and ozolinsh be purely accidental then what could mcgill and hammond have do to prevent them hey get off the thing i no fan of either my point be that last year the shark have toughnes that wa miss thi year thi year we have more skill i all for that but if ymy skill player keep get beat up and injure they ca do you much good whether it a cheap shoot or not you ca let the other team push you around the shark simply get push around to much other team know thi they know they could aggressively check the shark and not pay for it adding some player in the off season who will add some toughnes to the team will help insure that next season other team will be more hesistant to vigorously check my skill player or to take cheap shoot it do guarantee no injury nothing do but it something the shark can do to reduce the number of injury mark just say mark spiegel spiegel cow epicenter
