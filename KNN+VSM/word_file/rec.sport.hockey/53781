from nlu nelson lu subject shark review part left wing apparently part defenseman number through wa lose when i post it to make thing worse i lose my own copy i have ask on the shark mail list on which it do get out to see if someone can mail me a copy back if someone respond i will repost it when i get it otherwise i will re-write it in a day or two and post it sorry about that larry depalma season acquired free agent from minnesotum grade i no watch the shark include me know where depalma wa at the end of the season the shark appear to still have hi right but he wa in san jose he wa in kansa city and hi name ha appear on the waiver wire and that kind of invisibility wa prevalent for the most part for depalma after be call up october against the tampa bay lightning depalma have an excellent week score point in game while play good defense unfortunately the depalma then disappear the rest of the way get just more point in more game and generally look lethargic and uninterested on both end of the ice he then wa send down to kansa city walk out from there and wa suspend and later reinstate when it wa reveal that he wa injure he then promptly disappear from the watch eye of shark byte a the mail list be now know to shark official faithful and neither the shark nor we mi him johan garpenlov season acquired trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and round pick in entry draft from vancouver grade after an early slump garpenlov wa nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finish with point in game second highest total on the team a he click well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau kisio get most of the credit but garpenlov finish second in the mvp vote clearly demonstrate hi playmaking and score skill a he wa see make excellent center pas a well a finish pas to him by put the puck past oppose goaltender get a club-high power play goal contrary to hi previou rep garpenlov also show that despite hi small size lb he wa will to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet he also still need to work on hi defense although he improve tremendously throughout the season and wa actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season he will be a major key to the offense next year david bruce season acquired from st loui in expansion draft grade i after a banner when he lead the team in power-play goal and wa third in total score point in game bruce wa bother virtually all of thi season with a groin injury which keep him out of the lineup for all by game thi season of course it be difficult to speculate how well he would have do thi season have he not be affect by the injury but the bruce wa effective with a man up or a man short in the shark first season and wa expect to be a strong offensive leader thi season a well the injury appear seriou which be a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead hi future with the shark next season appear cloud mark pederson season acquired trade with philadelphium for dave snuggerud grade i b it be difficult for me to understand the flyer decision to unload pederson after a very good offensive season last season point in game but after rid the pine early in the season pederson wa summarily send to the shark in exchange of the defensive-minded snuggerud and he finish with game combine with the flyer and the shark he wa also limit by injury thi season and thi limit hi production point but when healthy pederson appear impressive with a good score touch good size and the willingnes to throw it around although he not consider a physical forward and good speed he also do not appear to be a liability on defense but the shark probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly pederson can do john carter season acquired free agent from boston grade i carter wa definitely one of the hardest worker on the team and the hard work work wonder a at time he look great on ice however although he do look great at time the fact that he receive just point in game for hi effort be a sign that there be only so much hi hard work can do and the shark confirm that by send him to kansa city with about game leave in the season carter who will turn on may alway hussled but a a result wa sometime trap too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he wa generally a credit on the defensive end but he be probably of limit utility in that capacity and he do not impres offensively although he wa one of the best shark at draw penalty he be very unlikely to be back next season jean-francoi quintin season acquired from minnesotum in dispersal draft grade i i do understand why the shark do let quintin play any more than the game he play thi season he wa generally hard-working and create opportunity offensively and appear at age ready for regular nhl duty at least for a team like the shark finish with point in those game while not be a defensive liability shoulder injury in train camp before the season limit quintin the team lead scorer in exhibition game despite sit out the final two to just game with the shark and the blade that season but he look impressive he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season mark beaufait season acquired round pick in supplemental draft grade i after a all-star season at kansa city beaufait get a cup of coffey with the shark late in the season when the blade knock down a playoff spot and the shark decimate with injury play game and score a goal for hi only nhl point thu far despite small size lb beaufait wa not shy to throw himself around when necessary and look pretty good at time although it too early to judge him base on nhl game in which he play mostly leave wing away from hi center position at northern michigan and kansa city jaroslav otevrel season acquired round pick in entry draft grade i like beaufait otevrel also play away from hi normal position when he wa up for hi cup of tea game midway through the season he wa generally very much of a defensive liability and do not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he get in those game he may need another season to work on hi defense but once hi defense be acceptable he should be ready michel picard season acquired trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau grade i the picard although he perennially tear up the minor seem to be close to be out of chance for some reason after be acquire by the shark but fail to impres the management in game score goal for hi only point and he spend most of the rest of the way in kansa city he wa not particularly strong defensively and despite hi offensive brilliance in the minor he ha fail thu far to score in the nhl although he ha be give limit opportunity he may be the shark bait in the expansion draft dody wood season acquired round pick in entry draft grade i although perhap i should give a grade at all i have be accuse of knock on wood too much then it be probably no surprise to you that i be thoroughly unimpressed by wood thu far although game be a small example he wa generally a nonfactor on offense wa not particularly good defensively and take too many silly penalty lose many fight in the proces and gather penalty minute in those game project to to in an season he not ready and need at least another season at kc where he can work on hi fight skill if nothing else hi relatively small size lb do not give much possibility that he can survive at thi stage a an enforcer go calgary flame al macinni for norri gary robert for hart and smythe go edmonton oiler go for playoff next year stay in edmonton nelson lu claudiu contact for the san jose shark
