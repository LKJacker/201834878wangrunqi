from jimf jim frost subject re too fast boyle craig boyle write the quality of autobahn be something of a myth the road surface be much different to a typical tx freeway they be better in term of light safety sign roadmarking etc they light the highway in texa funny everywhere else i be they only light at junction i wo even get into how much road mark vary between state and locality except to say that there be some area where mark be essentially nonexistant than most of the road here a dip in the asphalt that you test ymy shock on at will kill you at do get me wrong i love to it would have to be quite severe i do recall any u freeway without road damage warn that i would regard a unsafe at in any decent well damp car i suspect you have very limit experience u freeway vary dramatically particularly between state i can name a number of interstate highway in variou part of the country where would be very optimistic in any car i not sure what you call quite severe in term of road deviation but i suspect every single bridge junction on through ct would be consider so they hard to take at that not the only interstate i see with such deviation but it one i drive frequently texa be pretty much an edge-case you ca assume that everywhere ha road in such good condition such flat terrain and such wide-open space it just ai so jim frost jimf
