from heiser bill heiser subject re ford probe opinion center around the gt in article chuck chuck kesler write jeremy g merenes zonker say can anyone offer any opinion of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair record reliability mileage etc some other owner on the ford-probe mail list have comment about thi problem but i have see it happen on my month old probe gt i think thi may be something that ford ha correct since the initial batch of car also someone say that ford ha issue a service bulletin to inform dealer about how to correct thi problem so you may be able to get ymy dealer to fix it i have have my probe look at twice by my local dealer where i purchase the car the first time they make thi problem worse the second time after advise them of the service bulletin mention on my ford-probe mail list they say they do know of the bulletin they adjust the window and make it much better however it now make a scritch scritch noise on rough road and still squeal when i the window in wet weather anyone else do thi ford only gife key with the car ford spend an extra few penny i get two key with my car but only one remote-entry push-button thingie but then i buy my with mile and i think it may have be a repossession so i not surprise something wa miss horn button behind air bag in speak and not in center personal preference i be seriously consider follow the advice in the owner manual where it describe the procedure to follow if you discover something on ymy ford that could cause seriou injury threaten life etc something about notify the national traffic safety group a well a ford those little button be terrible the latter be probably because of the air bag it pretty much take up all the space where you expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i wa surprise to find that the probe come with one of those nice sound horn instead of the japanese sound kind the previou probe have japanese horn well i gues that good in a way but in a way it bad when someone hear that kind of horn they expect to see a big american car they may not associate the sound with a small jap car style car like the probe be tire fling onto side of car yeah not very badly but enough to be annoy sometime the mudflap help a lot transmission the speed be a must i have alway be a guy almost every car i ever own ha be a because i get a good deal on thi car with the mile i knowingly overlook the fact that it ha an automatic but it be a pretty high-tech automatic it be a fully electronicaly control with torque converter lockup even with the automatic i get mpg on the highway drive but of course drive be illegal so i probably make that sentence up around town the mileage ha be around not bad for an automatic of course it do have the control of a but since i do a lot of city drive it turn out to be very convenient it nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time although that too be illegal here in we-like-to-control-your-life massachusett no noise when go over still shake and rattle ha be my main gripe i get them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpourus of rattle when it get older tire goodyear eagle leave hop for on my probe gl i get about out of the original goodyear and have drive the replacement tire bridgestone mile when i trade the car the firestone on my probe look like they design for performance ie rather wide shallow tread etc so they probably wo last a long but the car handle very very very well it stick to the road like glue even on a rough surface interior be very very nice too very please to the eye and ergonomically sound definitely do a very very nice job on thi one the car ha a much more expensive than it actually be look and feel to it ye thi car stiff suspension be for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i strongly suggest look into the having drive an probe for year i find the suspension interest the car actually drife much better than the it be a very firm ride and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road yet the car remain very civilize on even the bumpiest road you hear and feel the bump yet the car retain it posture very well if you have passenger by all mean bring them along too they find that they have no room in the back and you find that the car ride differently if that better be up to you well i would encourage passenger-carrying in the probe unles the person in the front seat like to sit with hi knee to the dash a mention in the consumer report write-up consider the back seat a a parcel shelf no biggie to me though if it have be i not have buy the car but it definitely not a family car also there a lot of glas around you which i wa expect the temperature inside the car get pretty hot in the summer be a must on any probe from the in particular send out a real blast of cool air when the ac be on max that lot of glas you mention be what gife the car the very good visibility report you see in all the write-up most car do have that good visibility i hear that the exhaust system ha trouble but mine work fine i have hear about thi one i know that some of the very early probe and maybe have problem with prematurely rust muffler which the complaint i hear re exhaust system on have be on the gt of course be a different engine that be a differeent exhaust system i wa one of those with an who qualify for the free replacement since i have already replace the muffler when i receive the notice i due a refund from ford i apply in february and be still wait give me a free rental car for the day and a half that i wa without my car i wa quite happy with the way they handle especially consider that i wa expect the worst from them ye i wa pretty amaze when i have my car in for some touch-up adjustment thi past week and they have to keep it overnight too busy for them to get to it and they offer to pay for a rental they do make me pay for taxe and insurance though from what i hear it sound like have some qc problem with the probe and probably when they first go into production but i think these problem have mostly be correct at thi point that almost alway to be expect with a completely new car like thi though i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm but i seriously feel the car design be sound and expect it to do very well bill heiser heiser heiser boston university boston ma
