the forecast call for thunder t-bird sc it a hell of a thing kill a man you take away all he ha and all he ever gon na have will munny unforgiven i be beyond the under age group but i have an experience a few year ago that might be interest to you i own a toyotum celica gt i decide to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runner include the toyotum supra turbo and the porsche model year i narrow it down to those two i like the simplicity and handle and snob appeal too of drive a porsche the supra turbo wa le money and have more feature and performance almost a personal luxury car it have better acceleration and a higher top speed than the i wa almost ready to give in to a buy impulse for the but i decide to stop by my insurance agent office on the way i ask about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra ymy rate classification will be the same a the celica the celica wa consider a subcompact and for that year wa rat a one of the safest car with a slight increase because the car will be year newer my lower-risk division will continue to handle ymy account if you buy the porsche we have to change you to the standard higher rate company and ymy rate will double and if you go with a it another story again we cover the rest of thi year but cancel you after that but the supra be much faster than the and the be actually faster than the standard that make sense that what the book say we do insure corvette either for some reason the underwriter consider supra and their driver a very traditional and conservative i eventually go with the supra for a number of reason the porsche dealer have a nice salesman to get me interest but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payment it would have take a year longer to pay for the porsche plu it higher insurance i conclude that the high insurance wa relate to probability of auto theft everyone entitle to my opinion goldberg imagination be more important than knowledge albert einstein i live in idaho when i wa many year ago year i buy a tran am new insurance wa about when i turn it immediately drop to i have not have any accident before or after thi wa
