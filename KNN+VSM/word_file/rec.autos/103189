from jimf jim frost subject re best radar detector troy troy wecker write there be no question that the ha good range but not significant enough to be or time a expensive a some of the other the big win with the be not it range but rather it directionality and multiple-transmitter track which you later call a gimmick a conclusion i disagree with since the detector incorporate multiple receiver it not surprise that it significantly more expensive while the add capability may not help you there be add value for those of u who live in area where there be a lot of false-alarm summary way too expensive and not a significantly better performer i certainly call it interest but i another person who think that the add value might be come at too high a cost very adequate radar detector be available for le than half the cost and one of them ha suit me rather well if i do more long-distance travel in area i not familiar with i probably consider get the because it additional information would be useful in discriminate false alarm jim frost jimf
