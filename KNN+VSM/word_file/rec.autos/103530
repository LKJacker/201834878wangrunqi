from albion h bower subject re drag coefficientsvx s in a previou article gwm gary w mahan say could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficient cd mention in magazine i understand that lower number signify better aerodynamic but what do thi mean in the real world is there a way to calculate new top speed assume the car be not rev limit at top speed or mileage benefit if a identical car have the cd reduce from to it pretty complex and cd be the whole story either cd for car be usually calculate base on the frontal area of the car so a large car with a good cd could get the same drag force a a smaller car with a poorer cd to calculate drag use thi formula d rho cd s where d be the drag force lb rho be the local air density v be the velocity and s be the frontal area note that the piece call rho be sometime call qbar or dynamic pressure a fancy aero term for air pressure or force note that power be p f v where p be power f be the force drag in thi case lbf and v be velocity note that if you put the whole equation into one by substitute d for force you get a velocity cub term that why huge increase in power result in little increase in speed ditto for decrease in cd so if you have a mph car and reduce cd from to ymy new top speed be sound of trumpet fanfare mph sorry to dissappoint al bower dod alfa ducatus hobie kottke iaido nasa well goodnes sake do you know that girl ca play guitar mary chapin-carpenter
