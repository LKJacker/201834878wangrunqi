from eliot eliot subject re improvement in automatic transmission an excellent automatic can be find in the subaru legacy it switch to sport mode when the electronic figure it not when the driver set the switch which be the proper way to do it imo so what do sport mode entail several thing rev to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy delay upshift if you lift off briefly it will remain in the low gear thi be handy if you be charge through corner and would like to do without the distraction of upshift when there another curve approach part throttle downshift base on the speed at which the pedal be depress rather than the position of the pedal modern electronic can measure thi very easily and switch to sport mode thi be wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red my audi sense thi very well and can downshift on a little a half throttle if my right foot be fast enough also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better ga mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else be equal remember that the idea of a stick be more economical than an automatic make a big assumption that the driver be smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation how many time have you ride with an inattentive driver cruise on the highway at in gear of a speed how many of person who drive manual really know what the best gear to use be for every conceivable situation i sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip control automatic with all possible combination store in rom be likely to do better i can also say that all my previou assumption be prove wrong after i get a car with instantaneou mpg readout high gear low rev and wide open throttle be more economical than low gear high rev and small throttle open the explanation be quite simple if one sit down to think about it but not that obviou at first sight eliot
