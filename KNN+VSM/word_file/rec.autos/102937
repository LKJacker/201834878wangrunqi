from chuck chuck kesler subject re ford probe opinion center around the gt in article nathanp nathan write jeremy g merenes zonker say can anyone offer any opinion of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair record reliability mileage etc i be fix to buy a car in the next few month aim toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i be consider the probe accord corolla and the i buy a probe gt with the pep last july now at mile after debate over the sentra stealth prelude and celica the car design be different than earlier year so it too early to see it reliability so far for what it worth my comment my dislike shutting door with window up from inside rarely make good wind seal some other owner on the ford-probe mail list have comment about thi problem but i have see it happen on my month old probe gt i think thi may be something that ford ha correct since the initial batch of car also someone say that ford ha issue a service bulletin to inform dealer about how to correct thi problem so you may be able to get ymy dealer to fix it headlight have stick up a few time weather air condition break mile pressure cycle switch condensation around rear washer fluid container do drain completely have see any of these problem nor have i see these mention on the mail list so these might just be have bad luck with these cram engine little hope for do-it-yourselfer typical definitely part somewhat more expensive than normal ford part underside plastic do like sharp driveway and speedbump typical assembly gripe tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seam not stitch properly hopefully just a fluke no problem like these either i have be able to find any obviou place where they screw up ford only gife key with the car ford spend an extra few penny hmmm i get two key with my car something tell me you get stiffed by ymy dealer on thi actually if you count the credit card key that come in the owner binder i get key but since the credit card key do have any tooth cut in it yet i gues i wo count it rear hatch ha no pad on corner when up i wait for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn button behind air bag in speak and not in center personal preference the latter be probably because of the air bag it pretty much take up all the space where you expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i wa surprise to find that the probe come with one of those nice sound horn instead of the japanese sound kind the previou probe have japanese horn tire fling onto side of car yeah not very badly but enough to be annoy sometime my like engine definitely handle very good for fwd understeer only at limit transmission the speed be a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the sho i drive stability at high gear though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirror nice in fog never test in freeze weather bag see above rear seat fold down i have few rear seat passenger so a trunk not important no noise when go over still tire goodyear eagle leave hop for i agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine the interior be very very nice too very please to the eye and ergonomically sound i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth road and most noticable thing be that the probe suspension do like pothole when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jar you get be tolerable ye thi car stiff suspension be for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i strongly suggest look into the if you have passenger by all mean bring them along too they find that they have no room in the back and you find that the car ride differently if that better be up to you the problem with the back seat be that there no leg room plenty of head room though shorter person fit back there without any complaint so long a the seat they be sit behind be pull forward a bite to give them a place to put their foot also there a lot of glas around you which i wa expect the temperature inside the car get pretty hot in the summer my back seat passenger now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combine with the heat the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car i really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then i alway be a sucker for open air drive no leakage problem or anything like that yet i hear that the exhaust system ha trouble but mine work fine i have hear about thi one i know that some of the very early probe and maybe have problem with prematurely rust muffler which ford will replace at no charge but i have hear about anything like thi concern the probe i have have any real trouble with thi car outside of a cv joint boot that wa leak but the dealer take care of that promptly and even give me a free rental car for the day and a half that i wa without my car i wa quite happy with the way they handle especially consider that i wa expect the worst from them from what i hear it sound like have some qc problem with the probe and probably when they first go into production but i think these problem have mostly be correct at thi point that almost alway to be expect with a completely new car like thi though
