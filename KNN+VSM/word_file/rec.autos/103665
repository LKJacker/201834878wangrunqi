from mcrosbie subject re viper car alarm in article ronald e garnett write hello auto enthusiast i recently have more car mangle break into and decide to get an alarm instal it a viper and ha a shock sensor sensor for each door ignition cutoff and automatic door lock i have thi same alarm instal in my syclone it work great the shock sensor be very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor i have on my other car it do trigger if the car be rock gently by the wind but any kind of shock set it off even kick the tire set it off it work great what worry me be the hood and hatch if someone could pry them up gently enough then they could bypas the alarm the shock sensor be adjustable and there be two cycle on it you can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there be no way you could open the hood without set off the alarm although i know that you can not pop the hood on the syclone without set off my alarm now and yet i have have zero none false alarm with thi system the alarm tell you when you disarm it whether it ha be activate in ymy absence i have be able to trace every alarm to it cause and it wa not a false alarm i also wonder how easy it would be for a thief to crawl underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm i gues it would be possible depend on the vehicle my syclone be so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do thi there be supplemental power supply you can put on with thi viper alarm but i do have one i really think that if someone want my car that bad the alarm wo keep them from it even with a supplemental power supply viper also sell some fancy field disturbance sensor that supposedly detect person approcahing the car thi be primarily for convertible i have a convertible and have look at thi feature in detail alpine actually make a better radar unit if you want to get one of these it ha zone in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of ymy car ha pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm it shut down the zone or rather pull it in tighter i do see the real benefit to these unles you have a convertible that you leave the top down on avoid the voice alarm that can be add to the radar package it talk to person a they walk by i saw one instal on a lotu esprit the kid would taunt it see how close they could get before it them to get back the owner finally disable it which defeat the purpose in my mind i interest in the opinion of you netter about these problem and about the viper in general i be real happy with my viper one other feature i really like be you can tune it to ymy preference you can have it arm passively or not you can disable the chirp for you can have it the door when the alarm be i like these feature i hate the chirp when the alarm so mine flash the light only i like the door lock feature although i have to be careful to take my key with me because it do know if you have leave ymy key in the car when it passively arm and lock the door but if you be meticulou about take ymy key with you it take care of the rest the car be an ford probe gt that use to be in great shape ron garnett i look seriously at the alpine system too it be a real nice system but more money and it ha a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor the shock sensor be better and the viper shock sensor be better cycle than the optional alpine one imho i think the viper gife you a lot of good value for the money but it be absolutely tamperproof no system be except maybe the one that jame bond have on hi lotu in for ymy eye only anyone know where we can get one of those instal maybe that wa what they have in the van in the world trade center huh merrill
