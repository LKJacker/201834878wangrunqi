newuser documentation failing that please subscribe to the newsgroup and read the documentation provide there introduction to the newsgroup hierarchy be intend for technical discussion of automobile their design construction diagnosi and service other discussion be largely inappropriate especially for sale ad be intend for discussion of legal organize competition involve automobile technical discussion be appropriate insofar a they apply to competition vehicle discussion from either of two viewpoint spectator and participant be encourage argument about sport car be largely inappropriate a be most other discussion for sale ad be inappropriate unles they be for competition vehicle equipment discussion of illegal event be marginal one should probably avoid advocate break the law remember the fbi read usenet be intend for discussion relate to the drive of automobile also if you must discus v or radar detector or insert ymy pet drive peeve bonehead do it here be intend for discussion of issue relate to the use and ownership of automobile manufacture by volkswagen thi include vw audi seat etc it wa create on the grind that the info-vw mail list wa very successful it should not be presume from the existence of thi group that it be appropriate to create many group to cover many different marque group specific to individual marque should only be create on demonstration of sufficient interest vium some avenue such a a mail list be not properly part of the hierarchy it be however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so be mention here be intend for the discussion of older car usually more than year old although thi be not a hard-and-fast rule be not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the reader it be gatewayed to the moderate hotrod mail list and be for seriou discussion of modify and develop performance vehicle also not part of the official hierarchy devote to that peculiar american hobby of customize older car for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting be intend to capture discussion on all other automotive topic crossposting crossposting occur when more than one newsgroup name be include on the newsgroup line in the article header such article will appear in all of the newsgroup list crossposting be one of the most misunderstand and misuse facility on usenet you should only post to a group because you feel an article be appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience thi distinction be subtle but important radar detector article for example be more-or-les appropriate in they be almost never appropriate in or and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in or be not adequate justification for post to either group crossposting between any or all of the group be usually inappropriate if you find yourself do so consider whether or not it be truly advisable before send ymy article consider set followup-to to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost crossposting between and be chancy at best in particular flame war over the speed limit in the u the use of radar detector should never be crossposted between any of these group most reader of and could care le about the polouse radar and radar detector argument that go on endlessly in it be an excellent idea to check the newsgroup and followup-to line of article before post a followup in particular be wary of post to or or any combination of these three the life you save may be ymy own distribution there be a field in the header of any news article which allow you to partially control where the article go it be call the distribution field it may be very useful for many reason it should also serve a a reminder that news be a very large and widespread system the distribution of be fairly extensive a of thi write the automotive newsgroup be know to reach most of europe australium new zealand and some location in japan with thi in mind i offer the follow hint about use of the distribution field in ymy article header and on article content please take care not to send for-sale ad about clap out ford maverick in new jersey to france or californium i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason like maverick but only maverick at that when post technical question please include the market for which ymy car wa manufacture for example there be a number of difference between a european-market ford escort and a us-market escort likewise all and early alfa romeo reach the u with spica fuel injection european market car usually get carb often weber these difference can be important to ymy reader make ymy situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointles flame war and a significant spread of misinformation be careful about ymy capacity and specification when post in the u we get a mix of metric and english system value wherea europe be almost entirely on the metric system a future edition of thi monthly post will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviation that may not be know in some place that reach thi cut both way so let u not be parochial about it use the distribution field to limit where ymy article go when possible within north america the value na north america can canada and usa may be use in addition the two-letter state abbreviation of the u be support in some case if i want to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put ny nj in a distribution field note that multiple comma-separated value be legal these distribution field vary widely however so you should check with ymy local sysadmin to find out what be likely to be support in ymy area the danger of overgeneralization to amplify a warn from the distribution section of thi article be wary of make foolish assumption about all car tire etc what be true for a buick with a engine may be quite utterly wrong for a honda with a engine headlight law in sweden be decidedly different from those in idaho the need for adequate specification when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information if you have a question about ymy honda please specify year model engine size etc otherwise most answer to ymy question may be quite useles concerning lemon at one time or another every auto manufacturer ha manufacture a lemon or two even honda admit to thi please do waste everyone time by announce to the world that ymy brand x automobile be terrible so all brand x automobile be terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x company such article be worse than useles because they cause substantial waste bandwidth while carry little or no useful information concerning flame a much a we might wish it a flame-free newsgroup be something that most likely will never occur here be some guideline for flame and how to deal with them a list of flame-prone topic follow in the next section of thi post if you post something truly obnoxiou and inflammatory do imagine for a minute that include the word no flame will work it wo and you get exactly what you deserve if you go to flame you more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference no one be likely to believe bald unsupported assertion be careful about who you choose to insult consider not insult anyone asking the question it be a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i do read thi group it be a much better idea to end the question with please send email if there be sufficient interest i summarize the result in a later post i may mi post response to thi request answering the question if someone want to hop up their yugo do tell them to get a mustang either be silent or give them useful advice if someone want advice on defend a speed ticket do tell them to obey the law next time it offensive presume guilt which be not prove and do directly addres the original question in general do post in order to see ymy word in print and do post in order to enjoy feel smug and self-righteou stale inflammatory topic certain topic be consider stale by old timer while discussion of them be certainly ok and new factual information be welcome rave about them be extremely tiresome and may get the person who post them ignore altogether some topic be naturally inflammatory it be difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them some of these topic include the follow the speed limit in the u pro and con discussion about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detector discussion over which radar detector be best discussion over what be a sport car thi be one reason why be not a sport car group everyone would argue about what constitute a sport car dispute
