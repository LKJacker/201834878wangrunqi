from carolinafan uiuc subject re saturn pricing policy hok-chung tsang write in article fredd shuksan fred dickey write carolinafan uiuc write the biggest problem some person seem to be have be that saturn dealer make on a car i think most will agree with me that the car be comparably price with it competitor that be they be overprice compare to most car in their clas i do understand the point of argue over whether the dealer make the or not i have never understand what the big deal over dealer profit be either the only thing that i can figure out be that person believe that if they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total out-of-pocket expense for the car while thi may be true in some case i do not believe that it be generally true i buy a saturn sl in january of at that time base on study car price i decide that there wa no comparable car that wa price a cheaply a the saturn sure maybe i could have talk the price for some other car to the saturn price but my out-of-pocket expense would have be any different what important to me be how much money i have leave after i buy the car reducing dealer profit is not the same thing a saving money show me how reduce dealer profit save me money and i believe that it important my experience ha be that reduce dealer profit do not necessarily save me money fred say you buy ymy saturn at with a dealer profit of if the dealer profit be then you would only be pay for the same car so be that save money ye but the point be that price be competetive saturn may well be sell a car intend on give the dealer a profit but since a comperable honda with profit be more expensive it may be well worth it to buy the saturn moreover if saturn really do reduce the dealer profit margin by then their car will be even better deal say if the price of a saturn wa already below market average for the clas of car then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be below market average it will attract even more person to buy saturn because it would save them money force the competitor to lower their price to survive now not only will saturn owner benefit from a lower dealer profit even the buyer for other car will pay le not necessarily it seem to me that saturn salesdroid who do make a commision wherea their counterpart at other dealership generally do make more per hmy or whatever thi mean that saturn do give up the profit to their employee through commision which is take out of per car profit they just pa it along to le pressure is that save money maybe maybe not depend on account practice i rather pay more for dealer service that do cut corner to contain cost doug cka carolina blue honda civic dx chintan amin the university of champaign mail llama because he wa human because he have goodnes because he wa moral they call him insane peart cinderella man
