from welty richard welty subject frequently asked question archive-name thi article be one of a pair of article contain commonly ask automotive question the other article contain question of general consumer interest and be break out to facilitate crossposting to rpw last change february ct now permit radar detector usage new tire-traction q a rpw commonly asked question radar question q where be radar detector illegal a in the u currently virgina and the district of columbium prohibit all usage of radar detector new york prohibit their use in large truck in canada they be illegal in manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island they be apparently be illegal through most if not all of europe legislation which would make them illegal be pending in many other jurisdiction chance of such legislation pass vary a great deal q where be radar detector detector use do they really work a usage be spread rapidly initially they be use only in canada but now they be appear in new york and virginium it be unsafe to assume that they be not in use in connecticut and they work by detect a certain frequency radiate by many currently available super het radar detector some brand of detector radiate more strongly than other and be thu more likely to be spot new radar detector be become available which may not be detect by the current generation of detector detector note that a detector may only be spot by one of these device if it be turn on q what be vascar is it some kind of radar a vascar be nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance computer it depend on the operator press button a the target vehicle pas landmark no radar signal be emit by a vascar system q what be ka band radar where be it use should a radar detector be able to handle it a ka band ha recently be make available by the fcc for use in the u in so-called photo-radar installation in these installation a low-powered beam be aim acros the road at a degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture be take of vehicle which the radar unit determine to have be in violation of the speed limit ticket be mail to the owner of the vehicle because of the low power and the degree angle many person believe that a radar detector can not give reasonable warn of a ka band radar unit although some manufacturer of radar detector have add such capability anyway the number of locale where photo-radar be in use be limit and some question the legality of such unit best advice learn what photo radar unit look like and keep track of where they be use or else do speed q do radar jammer work are they legal a quick answer no and not in the usa detailed answer cheap radar jammer do not work well at all jammer that work be expensive and usually the property of the military jammer be a major violation of the regulation of the federal communication commission of the usa driving technique and vehicle dynamic question q what be understeer and oversteer a understeer and oversteer be term describe the behavimy of a car while corner near the limit limit of adhesion that be most driver do not normally drive hard enough for these term to be descriptive of the situation they encounter simply put they tell whether the car want to go straight in a corner steer le or understeer or it want to turn more in a corner oversteer understeer be commonly design into most production car so that untrained driver inadvertantly travel too fast wo get into trouble understeer may also be induce by use too much throttle in a corner oversteer be design into some more performance orient car it may be induce by lift on the throttle trailing throttle oversteer or tto in extreme case lift on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car react by fishtail or spin some technical detail in a corner at speed the tire on the car will develop what be call slip angle the slip angle be the angular difference between the direction that the car be travel and the direction that the steer wheel be direct the car to travel in understeer the front wheel have a greater slip angle than the rear wheel in oversteer the rear wheel have a greater slip angle than the front wheel q what be a rev-matched downshift a when downshifting the engine must be rotate faster in the lower gear than it wa in the higher gear however during a downshift normally you declutch and lift ymy foot from the throttle so the rev drop rather than increase in rev-matched downshift you blip the throttle before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed thi result in a much smoother and faster downshift q what do heel-and-toe mean a heel-and-toe be a technique use to do a rev-matched downshift while brake thi be normally challenge because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle it be call heel-and-toe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match rev for the downshift in many modern car thi be a misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle note that some race car driver will skip the clutch and just use the leave foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplish the same thing q what be double-clutch downshifting a while ymy right foot be do the above ymy leave foot can do one of three thing nothing declutch once or declutch twice the reason for declutch twice be to match the speed of the two shaft in the transmission to the speed of the engine thi be usually couple with rev-matching so that while the engine be in neutral and the clutch engage the throttle be blipped and both shaft of the transmission speed up the procedure be a follow declutch move gearshift lever to neutral engage clutch match rev declutch move gearshift lever to next lower gear engage clutch thi sound like a lot of work but with practice it become natural the problem that double-clutching solf be normally the function of the synchronizer within the gearbox in transmission without synchro or with very wear synchro double-clutching make it much easier to shift basically if you double-clutch well you be not use the synchro at all thi be generally unnecessary on street car with synchro in good condition q what do the number for acceleration from mile skidpad and slalom time in the auto magazine really mean may they be compare a in short not a much a the magazine want you to believe and almost never in more detail the acceleration number and mile time in the u may be vaguely compare a long a they all come from the same source testing procedure vary so much from magazine to magazine that compare a road track number to a car driver number be quite pointles keep in mind too that the same variation apply from driver to driver on the street the driver be a major often the major part of the equation skidpad vary and even if they do skidpad figure be really only test of the stickines of the stock tire they change radically when tire compound change do not make any assumption about the comparative handle of say two sport sedan base on skidpad number thi be not to suggest that skidpad be without value however skidpad be an excellent educational tool at drive school they be simply of limit value in the comparison of anything except tire slalom time be slightly more useful they test some small part of the automobile transient response however they be also heavily influence by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corner of the car envelope they do not tell you all you need to know before make a buy decision for example they do tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly go off-camber when a car ha an adjustable suspension these test be usually do in the sport set which may be quite unsuitable for daily drive the list of caveat could go on for page after page q my buddy claim that wide tire do make any difference accord to hi freshman physic textbook and that you ca ever accelerate or corner at more than do he know what he talk about a in short he ha get a clue in more detail the equation for friction use in freshman physic textbook presume that the surface be smooth dry and non-deformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which be far below it proper operate temperature pavement be never smooth it be alway irregular to a greater or lesser extent tire which be not really dry and solid a rubber be a substance which in it natural form be liquid and which ha only be coerce into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle be travel over in a tire at operate temperature grip be actually generate by shear stress inside the deform rubber and not by anything even remotely resemble friction in the freshman physic sense of the term the colder a tire be relative to it operate temperature the closer it behavimy will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the it proper operate temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually revert to liquid which be mostly like to happen deep in the tread cause characteristic blister and chunk thi latter though be almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street drive so unles you a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track drive do worry about it because tire traction be completely out of the domain of simple friction it do not obey the freshman physic equation at all thu dragster accelerate at more than and race car corner and brake at more than because simple friction do not apply it be actually possible for different size contact patch to generate differ amount of grip an actual analysi of tire behavior would require technique such a finite element analysi due to the complexity of the mechanism misc question q what do name or acronym stand for a here be a list of some of the name which be commonly ask about be careful in solicit the mean of other name a misinformation abound on the net in particular never ask in if you want a useful result saab svenska aeroplan a b or the swedish airplane corporation alfa societum anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili or the lombardy automobile manufacturing company fiat fabbrica italiana di automobili torino or the italian automobile manufacturer of turin bmw bayerische motoren werke or bavarian motor work mg morri garage q do vw own porsche a no porsche be a publicly hold company control by the porsche and piech family porsche ha extensive busines deal with which cause some confusion since currently porsche be in some financial difficulty there be a possibility that mercede or vw may be interest in purchase the company in the near future but thi be only speculation at thi time richard welty welty nothing good ha ever be report about the full rotation of a race car about either it pitch or roll axi carroll smith
