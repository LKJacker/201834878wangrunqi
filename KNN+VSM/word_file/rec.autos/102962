from nathanp nathan subject re ford probe opinion center around the gt jeremy g merenes zonker say can anyone offer any opinion of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair record reliability mileage etc i be fix to buy a car in the next few month aim toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i be consider the probe accord corolla and the the probe be the youngest of the bunch thu my interest in opinion but every magazine and rat book place it a an excellent value btw the be rear-wheel drive and be due for a re-design for thank in advance while i do read normally read thi group i wa look for valentine radar information sigh maybe in the faq and come acros ymy post i buy a probe gt with the pep last july now at mile after debate over the sentra stealth prelude and celica check thi month consumer report for previou probe record my criterium a fun car with ab airbag over and le than i think about a turbo but check with insurance person rule that out the tri-star car be out since they do have an air bag ditto for the mustang also no ab the fell into the pocket-rocket category a good use car buy the wa almost there but roll more than i like i do like the prelude at all too weird for me the ha a much smaller non-passenger space than i need so out that go the celica wa ok but underpowered when load with option and somewhat overprice too in non-turbo form i never consider the since it do have an airbag i do look at it for it rwd virtue but that it the corolla never enter my mind i should have look at the mitsubishi stealth more since my list wa exhaust i buy the probe the car design be different than earlier year so it too early to see it reliability so far for what it worth my comment my dislike shutting door with window up from inside rarely make good wind seal headlight have stick up a few time weather air condition break mile pressure cycle switch condensation around rear washer fluid container do drain completely cram engine little hope for do-it-yourselfer typical part somewhat more expensive than normal ford part underside plastic do like sharp driveway and speedbump typical assembly gripe tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seam not stitch properly hopefully just a fluke ford only gife key with the car ford spend an extra few penny rear hatch ha no pad on corner when up i wait for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn button behind air bag in speak and not in center personal preference tire fling onto side of car my like engine definitely handle very good for fwd understeer only at limit transmission the speed be a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the sho i drive stability at high gear though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirror nice in fog never test in freeze weather bag see above rear seat fold down i have few rear seat passenger so a trunk not important no noise when go over still tire goodyear eagle leave hop for a you can see i primarily interest in the engine while it do have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush the big sell point for me wa the all-aluminum value liter engine the overall car be a good buy for the money that market segment ha change much since july prelude vtec honda del sol i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth road and most noticable thing be that the probe suspension do like pothole when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jar you get be tolerable if you have passenger by all mean bring them along too they find that they have no room in the back and you find that the car ride differently if that better be up to you also there a lot of glas around you which i wa expect the temperature inside the car get pretty hot in the summer my back seat passenger now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combine with the heat i hear that the exhaust system ha trouble but mine work fine leather and the keyles entry system be available when i get the car so i ca comment on them i get the car before it wa officially announce i prefer cloth to leather anyway i would want thi car in the snow the suspension be too rough for the inevitable surprise pothole tire be mean for snow and the seat assume that you not wear lot of thick clothe rain be much better water generally bead off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper control be easy and understandable and i barely hydroplane once with the eagle and i wa really try there be also a definite lack of cup storage place the gt ha map holder below the speaker in the door but they rigid plastic that could fit two cassette or cd max the center rest ha cup holder and the back of the front seat have a cloth pouch but that it no change holder quite a let-down from the sho and the probe be definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car lastly do store wet car cover in the back the foam will soak the water up and the result will not smell pleasant nathan nathan jeremy merenes support ye olde
