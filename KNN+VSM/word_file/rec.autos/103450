from eliot eliot subject review audi quattro it be a while since i review a car but today i pay a visit to an old friend whose love for audi ha be so overwhelm that he make a not too sucessful live sell them without further delay i will get to the audi servotronic steer for those who be not familiar with what servotronic be it be the name for the speed variable power steer manufacture by zf and use in audi and bmw i have be outspoken in my dam of servotronic over the past couple of month and thi wa base on magazine review and drife of the audi cs quattro and the audi fwd i be quite happy to report now that on the the servotronic be inoffensive i suppose that due to the fat gumball tire the servotronic ha be load up more and thi so far ha be the best implementation that i have try it be far from perfect mind you and i be much happier if it wa an option that i could refuse but on the i no longer consider thi to be bad enough where i feel the entire car be ruin the steer be still a tad too light but it be accurate and i suppose the stiffly spring chassis send back so much information that some make it through to the driver hand so there be feel and there be accuracy in the steer but there be also room for improvement i consider the steer to be better than the japanese competition primarily because the japanese do not believe in feel and engineer it out completely engine wheee what a pressure cooker with just mile on the clock i do not expect the to be produce anywhere close to what it will be put out mile later but still the car pack a terrific punch for a turbocharged machine it be very unusual in that it encourage lazy drive low rev high gear it be so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there only liter of displacement to move thi pound car around in such a fashion with maximum torque available at rpm and a rpm redline the car can pretty much be leave in third all day which translate to a speed range of something like mph a chracteristic that one normally associate with large capacity the technical achievement be breadthtaking throttle response be right up there with a good atmospheric engine in fact it would even put peaky multivalve engine to shame downshift be almost unnecessary it be more fun to use the overboost feature than to rev the engine for those not familiar the engine feature up to second of additional turbo boost for pass sort of like light up the after burner in a jet fighter one could with the right foot only in third gear blast the car from to in just a few moment simply by floor the ga a far a the number go maximum torque available in overboost mode shoot up to about lb ft incredible for a liter it take a few moment for it to develop overboost but it be well worth wait for since thi be quite a heavy car one body part be not fling around like say the corrado the acceleration be smooth and strong somewhat similar to rid in a jetliner a it accelerate down the runway on takeoff also one be treat to a very distinctive and entertain whistle from the turbo the only entertain sound to come out of a very refine but bland sound banger ye audi ha refine the to the point where at rpm it sound a serene a it do at the smoothnes be outstanding but not quite up to the standard of a very good a valve bmw i say that in term of refinement willingnes to rev smoothnes lack of harshnes under full acceleration it be better than many however lose in the refinement proces be the characteristic cylinder bark that make the older engine so characterful if not terribly refine the valve turbo sound pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost subjectively i rate the vw engine a be far more musical than the turbo also audi own be also far more musical with a rorty race car growl when press though none of these can match it grunt the only hint of the engine true capacity occur when one be take off from rest after the turbo ha come to a near stop with the extra inertium from the permanently engage system one ha to be somewhat delicate in feed in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall alternately one could use more rev in both case a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine i think that audi of america should offer an automatic option for thi car just a they offer though in extremely small number a speed for the much peakier the characteristic of the engine be perfect for an automatic ironically in europe a slush be available but none be offer for the land of the slush marketing twit rear their ugly head again chassis i notice that audi tend to have very wide wheel and relatively modest tire width the car come with firestone of size which be not uncommon at all however the very attractive speak wheel be no le than inch wide so there be no sidewall bulge whatsoever combined with the flare wheel arch the ha a mouth water macho yet subdue look on rough concrete it become immediately clear that the new body style ha make significant advance in structural rigidity a well a road noise suppression i suppose the two be inter-related but i digres to use a cliche the body feel like it ha be carve out of stone flex be totally undetectable even when go over rough road with a super rigid body like thi stiff spring and stiff damper do not cause excessive harshnes and while the ride quality will never worry a lexu it will also not draw comparison to truck or pony car the servotronic steer ha already be mention i consider it to be inoffensive because it do not inhibit spirit corner i wa able to test the car corner power without too much trepidation i think a new concept be at work in thi car with it fat gumball tire talk about understeer or oversteer be practically meaningles on a bank highway on ramp i go in slow and start apply power a i go around i could feel the g force build to the point where the skin on my face wa be tug sideway yet the car wa totally and completely obedient to throttle and steer input it felt that the limit be not even close to be approach the g force be thrill but the entire affair of go around a curve be strangely uninvolving you tell the car what you want and it do it end of story i think that i be start to relate more and more to those reviewer who be highly impress by the honda nsx clinical efficiency but be unable to fall in love with the car the brake have a very good firmnes to them and stop the car pretty well too though i read that they be prone to fade i be not too surprise since the do not have uprated brake over the base audi fwd harder pad would help but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold i be start to see a trend among the sedan maker where extra weight be not be offset by additional brake capacity the fade performance be nothing to brag about neither be the or the legend brake fade these day seem to be a forget virtue when everybody attention be focus on anti-lock capability comfort for a car with such sporty ability it comfort level be also excellent the cabin be beautifully appoint with carbon-fiber panel insert in place of the wood trim of the all the expect gizmo be there heat seat power seat seat memory power thi and that the glare ommision wa the trip computer which wa remove because audi ha get it to work reliably yet that mean that the car ha no boost gauge a real disappointment take into account how much the turbo dominate it performance unusual for the german the come with a honda style moonroof a well a the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch noise level include engine and tire noise be so low that i would consider the lexu advantage in thi area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer conclusion even though few will be able to afford an audi at it sticker price of the car be a bargain if one take into account what it ha to offer over the competition the valve turbo be a real gem even if it do produce ferrarus sound no other sedan maker offer the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some be worth the extra money all by itself the safety feature be also top notch side impact standard compliant the very elegant automatic seat belt tensioner and the dual airbag the series audi have be outstanding in government crash test it get my thumb up for be so overwhelmingly capable rather than be all out excite and intoxicate eliot
