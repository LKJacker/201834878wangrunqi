from garyl gary lorman subject re electronic odometer wa used bmw question in article lovall daniel l lovall write in article conradie gerrit conradie write however if i be to design a bmw electronic i will use a counter to count the number of time the car pass million mile or whatever and store it in the car computer memory thi could be read when do a diagnostic test ditto for the date of the odometer a easy a thi be i do know why manafucturer do do it do they to prevent illegal odometer tamper but a a previou writer say it will in any case take aeon to reset an odometer mechanic or electronic by simulate a drive car it will be easier to reprogram it how i do know it should be that hard if you know much about digital electronic if the counter be make with standard ttl chip all you should need to do be find the chip s use for count figure out what mileage you want to put in and preset it but wire the preset pin directly to you also have to know what the convention be for low and high it might be a little more involve than thi but it should be beyond someone with a bsee or b eet all the display do be convert what the counter chip say into digit use a translation table store in rom selah dan but those chip be probably inside a custom chip to make it smaller and use le power and the pin be not go to be available it would probably not be ttl but might be cmo wider operate voltage range not that the tecnology would make much difference plu the custom chip would probably be pot encapsulate with epoxy good luck garyl any shark that get to be or foot long with big tooth can be consider dangerou bowl
