from jmh jeffrey hoffmeister subject re dumbest automotive concept of all tim in article fvq jimf jim frost write jo joe staudt write in article jimf jim frost write stuff delete the silly thing about thi whole argument be that most of the trunk release i tempt to say all but there bind to be a counterexample only operate if the car be on acc or run thu you ca easily pop the trunk without start the car most car the only car i ever see with thi feature have be gm car my mazda honda and come soon probe all have cable-operated release my camaro have an electric hatch release that wa thankfully independent of the key in the ignition the exception to the rule mention in my first sentence i should probably have say glovebox trunk release i have encounter any glovebox release that be cable operate numerou gm and several car that i encounter have electrical release in the glovebox and all of the one i see need the ignition on to some degree to operate ymy camaro example be note but since it a hardtop it not a big deal i never run into a convertible with a cable-operated trunk release i agree that in such an environment a cable or always-active electrical release would be rather stupid jim frost jimf my honda ha a cable release that can be lock out with the ignition key the valet key can be leave with someone and will not unlock the trunk or enable the cable release i remember my mother corvette that have an electronic hatch release locate on the driver door which wa alway active the fact that the car have no real trunk make the security measure of beign able to dis-able the hatch release unnecessary
