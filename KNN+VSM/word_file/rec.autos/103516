from petebre brent a peterson subject re drag coefficient in article gwm gary w mahan write could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficient cd mention in magazine i understand that lower number signify better aerodynamic but what do thi mean in the real world is there a way to calculate new top speed assume the car be not rev limit at top speed or mileage benefit if a identical car have the cd reduce from to i do remember the formula off hand a it ha be awhile since i take aerodynamic and have use the stuff since the cd be relate to the drag force which be what effect top speed and fuel consumption when the drag force on the car or aircraft be greater than what the vehicle engine can overcome it ha reach it top speed auto of course also have to overcome roll resistance since drag oppose the vehicle motion the engine must make up for that by burn more fuel anyway since the geometery of an auto be rather complex the drag pressure coeffiecent etc be either find experimentaly or use a numerical method anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff be cd d where d be the drag force q the flow velocity and r be the radiu of the clyinder to get a rough very rough estimate you can set r at the car width q at the car speed and know the cd find the drag force that the car would need to overcome bp
