from dalibor stefan dalibor subject re too fast jimf jim frost write there be a few thing to keep in mind about europe since you bring it up my autobahn knowledge be admittedly second-hand but i believe the follow to be true my knowledge about drive in the be also second-hand but i think i can correct ymy statement about my autobahn driver be much better discipline in europe than they be here oh yeah that would be paradise in fact you can forget it from all i hear from my relative driver esp here in germany be much more agg ressive but not discipline one of my relative a resident hire a car at the nuernberg airport and go about mile to my home he say then that he grow about year older during thi ride and swear he never drive a car in germany again thi wa in and he keep hi promise the situation now be even worse a effect of the increase volume of traffic what you mean by better discipline should perhap be consider cautiou due to fear when drive around here you alway have to take into consideration that the majority of the other driver absolutely rely on you they expect that nobody fail or sleep many of them exploit thi by drive a fast a their car can go of course only where that be allow you might think dream on so any mistake you make be a very high risk to ymy health and if you ex pose to such a situation from ymy very first day a a driver you learn to handle it or you lose that the way i and most person i know experience my traffic situation whether you think thi be pleasant or efficient be up to you i think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speed with modest compare to the volume and decrease rate of lethal accident otoh more and more person esp woman dislike drive because they feel overtax and threaten and each accident be one accident too much the road comprise the autobahn be much better design than they be here and usually include animal fence thi make them far more predictable than most u highway better design and maintain may be but animal fence be very rare auto bahnen and many other street have guard-rail i hope that the right word a plank make from thick steel sheet fix on upright it about foot high those guard-rail be design for keep vehicle on the road smaller animal can crawl under the plank bigger one can easily jump over it the point be that esp larger animal be very rare in germany they tend also to be very timid accident cause by animal be a neglegible danger not all of europe be the autobahn most place in europe have speed limit that be out-of-line with what we use to have in the u if my friend be lie to me they typically not much higher than you right there be speed linit even on the major part of the autobahn but the attitude toward drive see above seem to be very similar to that in germany i be in france switzerland italy austrium spain belgium the netherland beside that you really ca rely on the resident abide the local speed limit i get quite a lot of practise mile and i use to travel at mph fyi with a car even smaller than a rabbit but i consider drive on the highway round pari or milano really a thrill i strongly suspect you wo find a lot of rabbit owner do nearly on the autobahn but i could be wrong sorry but you find quite a lot rabbit-class-car or even smaller mine be a peugeot owner go that fast small car with much hp be very hip over here and most person buy such car be afraid to let them run some person have no respect for their own life i disagree the size or weight of a car be rather irrelevant car weigh le than kg and the driver have a chance to survive accident at mph or higher otoh when crash against a solid object at mph it make no difference whether you sit in a porsche a mercede a tank or on a bicycle ymy dead bye stefan stefan dalibor dalibor and now for the next case in kangaroo court i accuse you of be the reincarnation of adolf hitler i do think that mere denial will be sufficient you will have to submit to examination by a parapsychologist that i personally select perry metzger pmetzger in article in
