from buck ken buck subject re question about insurance company esp geico wrat wharfie write my car wa recently destroy in a hail storm i fully expect to get jerk around by the insurance company i wa the only one who have hail damage state farm open it claim center on even and weekend and fly down additional adjuster from dalla i have no experience with state farm but i think it important to differentiate ymy experience from a typical accident hail damage be clearly not the fault of the owner and also tend to be well publicize in the medium so it to the in co benefit to respond promptly and helpfully damage like thi do imply anything about the likelihood of future claim unles you live in an area that get frequent damage hail storm so there no reason for them to stop cover you that a lot different from at-fault accident or theft-related claim which may be more indicative of claim pattern
