from mihir pramod shah subject re saturn puzzle by it price in article ykhsu write i be the person who start out thi subject to me the question really be not about dealer profit but the amount of money for the type of car i settle with a new subaru wagon with the similar amount of money a saturn dealer ask for a ok i know it a model but i think i get a better car though i have to adjust my initial idea of why i be get a new car today during a conversion with a friend i learn he reject a saturn for a ford tarur a it only cost him a little bite more than a i may be wrong but a load taru beat a saturn i agree that a fully-loaded would come close in price to a lower-end ford tauru a fully-loaded tauru on the other hand would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy a fully load would run somewhere around while a fully load tauru lx would be somewhere around the range a base tauru gl i believe might start around of course there be the tauru sho which can push if you really try but thi be a totally different car than ymy mainstream tauru sedan ymy statement wa not entirely faulty just a little inaccurate i ca see saturn be of better value and that be why i wa puzzle by it price oh we do not spend much time get my deal be better inform ha it advantage well that ok at least you not bitch about dealer profit like some of the other netter be you seem to have rationally pick out the car that be best for you the loyale be an age design that be about to be replace by the impreza wagon so you probably get a good deal on one of the last one then again i may be wrong yung-kao hsu mihir shah
