from hovnanium paul hovnanian subject re re toyotum land cruiser worth it in response to a post about suv i get several unsolicited recommendation to check out the land cruiser despite it astronomical price the toyotum dealer tell me it a cult car if a car be good enough to create a passionate and loyal follow there must be something really extraordinary about it so all you land crusher cultist here be ymy chance to convert me jonathan edward edward intranet inc based on my experience with a the hard-top jeep-style model i would definitely give a new model consideration if i be in the market the older model be very well build unles toyotum lose it mind i would assume until prove otherwise that the newer model have inherit some if not all of the quality of their ancestor two major difference in the run gear that i aware of need study my ha a solid front axle house wherea the newer model have independant front suspension the solid axle be theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model but only experience will tell the independant front suspension be no doubt a compromise make to satisfy the typical user who will never need a real utility vehicle the second difference be the type of transfer case use on the newer model i not sure but i think tioyotum go to a full-time or all-wheel drive system the older landcruiser have a lock-up type both have their advantage and disadvantage paul hovnanian hovnanium std disclaimer apply
