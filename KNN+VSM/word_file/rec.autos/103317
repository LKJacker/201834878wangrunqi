from eliot eliot subject horizontally engine wa vx in article bqueiser brian j queiser write there be two crank configuration for the flat the most common one be probably the crank that be very similar to the crank which flat engine have style crank comparing those two engine the and the flat have no first order shake force or rock moment the ha a second order shake force while the flat ha a second order rock moment the significant thing about the flat second order moment be that it can be easily balance out by add ma at the end of the crank the however require a counter rotate shaft with ma to balance out the second order force i be sure that subaru and porsche use the boxer configuration and not the inline crank that you analyze and compare would you care to re-evaluate the other case of a flat fmy i think that thi configuration be perfectly balance a far a primary secondary force and couple be concern i have an article in front of me that say so bottom line the biggest difference between the engine would probably be their intend use the flat be easier to fit under low hood and in rear compartment for mid or rear mount the can be mount transversely to reduce hood length read cab forward other than that there be much fanfare to the difference between them no matter what subaru ad say technology share with porsche indeed the flat fmy be also shorter than an inline so even if it be mount longitudinally it will not take up lot of length and a longitudinal placement be easier for a wheel drive drivetrain i think that subaru ad hold water in practice their flat four be noticeably smoother than inline and completely buzz free though some may not like it peculiar note but a alfa ha show a boxer fmy can produce a spine tingle scream that only the like of recent honda can approach eliot
