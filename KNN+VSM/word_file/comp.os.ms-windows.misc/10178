from werdna andrew tong subject re challenge to microsoft supporter rsrodger yamanarus write i say that the massive crash problem be exceedingly rare window itself almost never crash but it can be crash by an errant application my personal favorite any one of the corel program on the other hand i have have crash randomly a number of time mostly just run it own application i do know that ibm system the in particular have absolutely no problem with never have a random crash while run any of my program under in fact i do remember ever crash of course i really do run any program just the same bunch of do and window stuff that i alway be run and when i have the thi be the system run i have only one crash and it wa consistent ftp have a tendency to crash whenever i would get large file from particularly fast client dtr i figure out the problem wa with smartdrv write buffer if i turn off the write buffer everything would work fine ftp under ha never lock though i can even format floppy to use the most often cite example of the superiority of for instance i still wonder why print preview in a windowed wp do lock up my system yeah i gues i will to admit that be somewhat sensitive to specific hardware for do work perfectly fine on my please explain the only time i wait on anything under window be when i copy or format a floppy or when print and even then not long i get to page dump to the printman per minute and can still go do thing slowly while it do thi i download with pp while print well i save all my personal file to floppy and when i do that under window a floppy save of a large file hang up the system i also find it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the task option on fractint for do whenever i want to do a fractal computation in the background and not be able to addres ymy memory better than do not sure what you mean here the idea be that do session can see more memory than window do session i let xpl a shareware calculu program see around of free conventional memory which let me do bigger symbolic manipulation than be possible under straight do where it would see around of conventional ram i also find it really handy for my own dos-based program which without any re-writing could now handle larger datum set simulate for more iteration etc of course the point be now moot since the program i now write simply never run into memory limitation i never program for window so i do have much of a comparison here though
