from charlea charle allen subject re question on eisa video board performance from article by cfw christopher f wroten i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video card only match the performance of their isa counterpart for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iis-e be only about a fast a the isa diamond speedstar plu which be what i would call fast i do understand why eisa video card be a a group on the same level of performance a local bu card give that eisa video card have a bite bu to move datum around instead of isa bite good question answer the eisa bu do move bite rather than isa but it still move it at about the speed a the isa bu i think that either or mhz the local bu design also move bite like the eisa but they move the datum at the cpu speed up to mhz so on a cpu the local bu be move datum at mhz and the eisa be move datum at or mhz so the local bu should be to time faster than eisa on a mhz cpu eisa should be about two maybe time a fast a isa since they be not why would anyone me include pay a higher cost for a eisa video card when it performance be no better than and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such a a diamond speedstar from pc magazine i think recent report i know that atus make a pretty fast eisa video card but it around which be just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend and for i could get a diamond viper and still have leave over of course i have to get a local bu mother board too that a very good question the eisa bu do have more advantage over the isa bu than just it width for example interrupt and bu master but these other factor do not impact a video card very much they have more impact on file server with multiple hard drife full-throttle network card cd-rom etc can anyone shed some light on my thank christopher wroten cfw
