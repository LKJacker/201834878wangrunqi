from rjn robert j niland subject re procomm plu for window problem kentiler kent p iler write i have normal procomm plu for do but i be consider buy the window version it get really great review in computer shopper i have a friend who connect to the mainframe and unix machine here use it but the screen seem to have a problem keep up with the modem he ha a modem on a mhz machine i ca see it have trouble keep up hi pcplu for do work great re what to do after the high speed modem arrife edition apr thi article apply only to window and and not to nt or do app not run under window one of the unadvertised limitation of most current window pc be that their serial com performance be seriously deficient almost everyone who purchase a high-speed modem pep or hst discover the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming fax at after upgrade the modem overrun and retry error abound even when the only active application be the datacomm or fax program if the transfer complete at all it may take even longer than with the old modem there be three reason for the problem the universal asynchronou uart use in most pc be primitive device with single-byte fifo buffer if the operate can not read and flush each character at high interrupt rate the next incoming character overwrite the fifo and the previou one be lose do be a fairly single-minded environment during datacomm can usually keep up window ca window ha more operate system overhead than plain do and interrupt often take longer to service overrun be much more likely than under do a soon a you report to ymy vendor that you be lose datum you may be advise that you need to upgrade to a more likely since there seem to be a conspiracy of ignorance about thi issue you get no useful advice at all most of the store-front and mail-order source i speak with in attempt to solve my own problem have never hear the term and many do even know what a uart wa even ymy pc ha uart and do or if you can upgrade ymy board or add a new com board you may still experience error and overrun because the standard microsoft window com driver do take full advantage of the window be improve in thi regard over but i still recommend a driver upgrade application like which be what i use can not get around thi problem by themself if you have a modem card you may not have a problem a the modem part of the card can be design to be aware of the state of the uart and avoid overrun it however i would want to bet that the card designer be that clever and will insist on a uart if i ever buy a modem card some modem card do even have conventional uart but if they be to work with standard window driver they need to simulate one use below to see what the modem card be or be pretend to be the hardware situation the uart on most pc com port be base on national semiconductor or chip or megacell inside vlsi chip where you ca replace them you can id the uart type on ymy system by run the microsoft diagnostic program be sure to run it in do before bring up window the window serial apus may prevent msd from accurately identify a if you run it from a window do prompt the uart ha separate transmit and receive fifo with configurable trigger level and can run reliably at clock rate up to bp although with current modem technology there no point in push ymy luck by go over bp the ha short acces cycle time than the or the also ha dma capability but it be not clear that any pc driver ever use thi for more technical info see national semiconductor application note so what uart component do you have try to locate the uart on ymy mother board multi-function card com board or modem card if you ca find a socketed component with the number or ymy com port be probably bury in vlsi and you wo be able to perform a chip replacement if you can disable ymy vlsi com port a i choose to do you can at least add an aftermarket com board if you have one or more socketed or chip you can buy plug-in or low power cmo version ics from several supplier typically for to each the n chip be the normal dual-in-line package other style be available but avoid any chip without the a the be presumably all ok early n chip have bug although national will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free clone chip be available from variou ic maker other than national the manual for the turbocom driver state support for the follow apparently equivalent chip national semiconductor chip technology texa instrument silicon system vlsi turbocom warn about the pre a and western digital say that problem have be report with early ibm and system ibm reportedly will upgrade them if you do have socketed chip you need to buy an after market com or multi-function board if thi be a modem card situation you may be hose to add a new com or multi-function card you need to either disable the port s you be replace or re-assign them to although watch out for irq conflict without turbocom although cheaper card be available in the interest of get the problem solve quickly i elect buy the modular circuit technology mct-aio card from jdr microdevice samaritan drive san jose ca voice u voice other fax u the mct-aio and the be important sell for it be an isa card provide port type connector addres and irq comment com com irq in socket com ribbon com irq in socket parallel irq game ribbon the kit include a ribbon cable and connector for the secondary com port a ribbon for the game port two bulkhead plate for the ribbon-based connector and a adaptor cable each port can be individually disable and the com port have tx rx rt ct dtr dcd and dsr jumper jdr also sell a m-f card that also ha ide i have hear from several person about le expensive m-f card with tsd system for the card plu per greenfield trading and distributor voice fax their card be and they sell for r s datum system inc east highway longwood fl phone fax card for i have no personal experience with any of the firm except jdr meanwhile back at the mct card from jdr i only need two serial port and be run out of irq on my pc so i disable my built-in vlsi-based port however with the turbocom driver below i could have set the internal a and use irq share the software situation simply upgrade to uart will not completely solve common overrun problem the standard m serial driver do take full advantage of the the window driver be even le capable and the window driver have the follow limitation they enable only the receive fifo and only at rate above bp they never enable the transmit fifo which result in an interrupt rate of during upload they set the trigger level at byte too high it easy for more byte to arrive before the driver can read the fifo the port menu of the control panel only allow speed up to with a modem sparse datum and text can easily compres or more suggest that a host dte connect rate of bp would be effective the apus wo accept rate above the apus wo let do program know there be a there and even if it do do program that be get little benefit from a port with the standard driver they do allow irq share for the bio do initialize properly in many system window provide no workaround for app that do provide port speed option above bp these problem be reportedly not solve in window nt or do and may or may not be address in any window release after but before rumor suggest they may be solve in window you can get replacement driver that solve all of those problem by buy a copy of turbocom current version from bio-engineering research pacific commware division beacon hill lane ashland or voice fax bb mcimail compuserve price wa around a i recall bio-eng be not set up to accept credit card so i have to send a check egghead and list turbocom but a far a i know they do stock it bio be not a software company per se they apparently need reliable hi-speed serial connection for an in-house instrument application write their own driver discover a market for it revise it to be a general purpose com driver suite they recently upgrade it for window it be run-time license i now have my host dte connect rate set to bp most of my datacomm app and i be have zero problem with download i routinely see transfer rate that exceed bp i be also use bp when link an to my pc with lossles bi-directional upload to variou remote system be another matter because many host be still use antique uart and driver note that be still the highest rate that the window port menu in control panel will allow in configure a com port turbocom get around thi by allow you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multiple of the rate pass through the window api and dialog box i also have hardware flow control enable and i suggest that you do the same even if you only ever transfer ascius datum be not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control the informal dec standard for hysteresi be that the sender may transmit another ye sixteen byte after receipt of the xoff from the receive system or device the byte fifo in the be clearly not big enough to let u rely exclusively on a well-respected datacomm engineer ha inform me that the ca really do all by itself in the environment so use datum rate above may still be risky even with hardware flow control a with turbocom can still experience overrun in very busy system with lot of app run and seriou swap in progress if thi be ymy situation you may need to buy a co-processed com board but thi will cost you more than a upgrade a review of two such board and a review of turbocom can be find in the issue of window source magazine i suggest try a upgrade first and experiment with proces priority and time slice if you be a power user whose thrash system still run into comm problem closing soapbox comment the state of serial datacomm support be an embarrassment acros the computer industry because it be the oldest standard interface the job of design hardware and write software often seem to be assign to the least senior or lowest rank engineer at computer company the design of the average serial port be at least ten year behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstation vendor i lobby for improve serial port when they be do the initial design of a new system that family of machine wa subsequently introduce with port however thi be the exception few computer company seem to have any champion for decent you may a well learn what you can about serial because thi situation show no sign of improve soon when arrife i expect cry of outrage from window user world-wide whose pc sort of work today with but will fail miserably with without a hardware-buffered uart like the and without software driver that use that uart to best advantage a modem will be
