from jaya jayasooriah subject experience with do i have be have trouble post thi article from within tin for over a week if you do get multiple copy my apology here be a challenge to microsoft or microsort supporter to defend the pathetic state of do a an upgrade distribution it be a long story but would make good read for those who be interest in know the potential pitfall of upgrade to do that i have be able to notice after only about a week of play around with it my envorinment ti travelmate winsx ram disk system bio version by texa instrument vga bio v by cirru logic quadtel advance power manager v by texa instrument smart drive cache parameter a b window benchmark winbench tm v by zd lab after updgrading to do i could not understand why certain thing become so slow especially after i decide to try in the proces of find out why i discover some interest thing disk performance with double space and smart drive while most thing do not appear to slow down most of the time certain application appear to run very much slower what wa interest be that command like and be run far too slowly to consider them useful by any standard i suspect double space d and decide to measure it impact on my system use winbench tm the real disk winmark of for the original system a ship from factory with do and windoww become when upgrade to do with d thu there be an effective performance degradation of more than percent which do not really surprise me because i know that d compression must cost something specifically for short sequential read up to byte d actually improve transfer rate by about because cpu be faster than more cpu cycle need for d be more than compensate by save in cycle however for all other case particularly large random write the transfer take up to three time a long while the performance depend on the type of acces random or sequential small or large transfer unit on the average base on winbench assumption the disk slow down to half it speed the test alone do in mode see winbench and with smartdrv on do not say much except that it help to put into those subjective statement like be no noticable difference in performance or even that will speed up disk acces when you have a fast cpu and slow disk thi explain why some application run markedly slower but not why and the latter especially too so long double space and window dblspace will not run at all from within window not even if you want to only to get information not modify anything or for that matter even check on it usage try fasthelp dblspace in a do box within window and you will see what i mean from the error message you get how narrow mind can a programer get i wonder ye thi information can be obtain through the add-on to file manager but thi dll do not understand a compress floppy use the do supplement utility to create a compress floppy if you dont know how to do defragmenter be incompatible with ti apm defragmentation seem to take too much time even so i wait patiently till it finish and then run it again to just to confirm thi confirmation def command for the drive should take no more than second much faster on other defragmenter i have use but it take minute i discover that if i move the mouse defragmentation check run faster the figure tick more rapidly it dawn on me that thi have to do with ti battery saver advanced power management apm module which slow the clock down when it think that the cpu be idle and it obviously think d defragmentation wa an idle proces after disable the ti power saver thi operation take only second microsft programmer think and gateway nomad user be idiot in the file you can find the the follow running microsoft backup with and gateway nomad computer to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup for window or ms-do add a switch to the device command in ymy that load the file or before you run microsoft backup type setpower at the command prompt if you check ti manual on the option you will realise that it mean disable all power save feature of ymy notebook why would anyone want to run a driver disable a i have find out not only do ti power management interfere with microsoft backup a the claim but and and who know what else be cripple by the ti power saver it be obviou that there be not such thing a apm specification if there indeed be such a thing then either microsoft programmer or ti programmer dont know how to read these specification you dont have to gues a to who be the idiot by the way if you run the advance power management utility in when you check the statu it say power management statu setting adv max cpu idle of time thi figure of seem to be the steady state value on my notebook when i be run nothing window with only program manager in iconised form do that mean that window take up of my cpu all for itself and that i have at best only leave for useful work is such an overhead justify whether or not window be an operate system or just another user interface in do alone it report idle time look like window be a good example of busy wait type of package that i like my student to study a the classical example of my time microsoft programmer do not know batch program i like to structure my startup script and thu have the equivalent of addpath statement like thi set do set path c bin set path c window set path path c set path path mouse even though the new do wa instal in the same directory a the old one c do do installation program modife each and every path statement and prepend c do to it value a a result my resultant path ha so many do if the installation program want to remove the old do path and add the new do path clearly it ha to only scan for the path statement containg the old do directory and replace it by the new do path even thi should only be do if the new do be instal in a directory different from the old one be instead the microsoft programmer if you can call thi person one decide to meddle every path statement i have in the autoexec and prepend do to the value i wonder if microsoft be so desparate that it would not fire programmer who be incapable of the think proces i start a thread on thi when do come up and the microsoft representative in singapore call me about thi poster in fact he specifically say hi u counterpart saw the poster and relay the information to him a he do not have acces to internet now that ha not change one bite in fact if you have a path statement with path already in it be it not obviou that the thi statement should not be touch for any reason a another example of the inability of microsoft programmer to understand batch program i have the mouse driver invoke a set set path path mouse loadhigh mouse gues what memmaker do it replace the last statement with lh c why be it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and it parameter without touch the rest of the line i do not understand do software quality do be the only operate system i know in which under normal usage you end up create a file that you can not get rid of use of the command that come with it i be deliberately be cryptic about thi i challenge microsoft to use all it programmer to catch thi bug and publish it if they dont within a week i will post how you can create thi ghost file surely if i can pick thi bug without even look for it after use a particular command only twice i be sure two dozen microsoft idiot programmer randomly bang on their keyboard over a week could find it that be what i wa tell how microsoft test the quality of their product i think it be funny that microsoft ha find way to test quality when it be accept in the industry that quality can not be test but can only be build into the product no wonder they can not provide any form of guarantee on their product not even a decent list of bug that will prevent score of user from destroy their disk beyond repair also if you run def often enough repeatedly when the disk be fully defragmented you may get error that wa create by the defragmenter i get my file size error and it get truncate when i do the chkdsk thi happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly do it job and with no new file creation since microsft dont you dare reply to thi poster on the network until you admit that ymy d ha bug and be will to let u know what we should watch out
