from angcl claude anger subject re wp-pcf linux risc in article leebr lee brian write in article eugene write in article ghhwang ghhwang write dear friend the risc mean reduce instruction set computer the risc usually ha small instruction set so a to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some book about computer architecture for more information about risc hmm not that i be an authority on risc but i clearly remember read that the instruction set on risc cpu be rather large the difference be in address mode risc instruction set be not a orthogonal be cisc theoretically suppose to be reduce not any longer that why everyone be argue about risc cisc personally i think cisc will win out just take a look at the pentium not that i like intel architecture either but that another story bye do you mean that the pentium be better than a risc or that it will outsell them all if the first you have to remember that intel cisc like the pentium be a alway a generation away from the best risc also risc cpu be more costly because they be not sell in the same quantity not even on the same order but i remember read about year maybe about a from hypercube that do a mip wa superscallar and reorder it instruction itself so
