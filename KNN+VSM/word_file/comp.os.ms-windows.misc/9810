from bkph berthold horn subject re atm in article down lamont down write so good that there be any diff whether or not atmanager be turn on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technology and tt there be some font that be only available a ps font if you have a ps font that you want to use use atm otherwise it be a waste of system resource or if you need to use a service bureau and they only set up to use type font from what i hear pure hearsay the result of output tt font a type be not a good a use high-quality type font in the first place unles you print to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device image setter a problem with tt font in window be that they do get convert to format ok and the hint be even use while thi be do but the result font be not hint the result be that they will work fine on a device of the resolution assume by the printer driver when the ps file be generate but they will not look good when print at a different resolution so when you print to an attach ps printer with the ps driver set up for thi printer result may be quite good but if you take a ps file make for that printer and run it on a device of different resolution such a an image setter then the result may not be so good
