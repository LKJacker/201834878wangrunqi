from dbarker deryk barker subject re wp-pcf linux risc leebr lee brian write in article eugene write in article ghhwang ghhwang write dear friend the risc mean reduce instruction set computer the risc usually ha small instruction set so a to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some book about computer architecture for more information about risc hmm not that i be an authority on risc but i clearly remember read that the instruction set on risc cpu be rather large the difference be in address mode risc instruction set be not a orthogonal be cisc the original risc have small instruction set and simple one the idea wa that a every instruction should be completable in a single clock cycle and b to have no microcode and c extensive pipeline a few comparison from patterson reduced instruction set computer cacm cpu year instruction microcode ibm dec vax ibm ucb risc stanford mip while research for the vlsi vax dec discover that of the vax microcode be there to support of the instruction set which account for a mere of all instruction execute the uvax subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and use a software emulator for these very complex instruction the full vlsi uvax include the entire instruction set wa time more copmlex but only ranm faster cpu chip microcode transistor uvax vlsi uvax real deryk barker computer science dept camosun college victorium email dbarker phone
