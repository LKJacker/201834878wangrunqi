from conditt paul conditt subject re christian and aid in article marka mark ashley write in article kevin kevin davi write many christian believe in abstinence but in a moment will be overcome by desire we all compromise and rationalize poor choice sin last week i wa guilty of anger jealousy and whole me of other stuff yet i be forgive and not condemn to suffer with aid to even suggest that aid be deserve be ludicrou some rule be make because at some point man be too stupid to know better yet eventually man learn but only after get a lesson from experience ye it important to realize that all action have consequence and that rule be make for my own good but to suggest that a disease be a punishment for certain type of sin i think be take thing much too far if we get some kind of mouth disease for lie would any of u have mouth leave what if we develop blindnes every time we lust after someone or something i dare say all of u would be walk into wall i wonder if aid would be a problem now if person do get involve in deviant sexual behavimy certainly person who receive taint blood be not to blame but it just go to show that all mankind be affect by the action of a few ye sin can have terrible consequence but we need to be real careful when say that the consequence be a punishment for sin the jew of jesu time believe that all sicknes wa the result of a sin then jesu heal a blind man and say that man wa blind to show the glory of god not because of sin if aid or any other std be a punishment for sexual sin what do we do with disease like cancer or multiple sclerosi which be just a debilitate and terrible a aid yet be not usually link to a specific behavior or lifestyle in addition imho forgivenes be not the end of thing there be still the matter of atonement is it aid i do know atonement be extremely important but i think you miss the mark about a far a you can by suggest that aid be an atonement for sin the atonement for sin be jesu christ period thi be the central message of the gospel a perfect sacrifice wa require for my sin and wa make in the lamb of god hi sacrifice atone for all of my sin past present and future god do not require pennance for my sin nor do he require u to come up with my own atonement he ha graciously already do that for u to suggest that aid or some other consequence be an atonement for sin be literally spit on the sacrifice that jesu make in case you could tell i get extremely angry and upset when i see thing like thi instead of rationalize my own fear and phobia we need to be reach out to person with aid and other socially unacceptable disease whether they get the disease through their own action or not be irrelevant they still need jesu christ no more and no le than we do i say thi before but i think it a good analogy person with aid be modern-day leper jesu heal many leper he can also heal person with aid maybe not on thi earth but in an ultimate sense my next-door neighbor ha aid she ha recently come to have a much deeper and more commit relationship with god her theology be what i would want it to be but god grace cover her the amaze thing be that she be gain weight she have the disease for over year and her health be excellent apart from occassional skin rash and such she attribute her improvement in her health to god intervention in her life who be we to suggest that her disease be some kind of punishment it seem to me that god be be glorify through her disease paul overstreet the country singer ha a good song title that i think apply to all of u but for the grace of god there go i or something like that may we all experience and accept god grace mark ashley disclaimer the opinion express marka here be my own they do not uunet marka reflect the opinion or policy the lost lo angelino of harri corporation paul conditt internet conditt applied research phone fax laboratory fedex burnet road austin texa university of texa postal box austin texa austin texa the most wonderful place in texa to live ttttttttttttttt ttt ttt ttt ttt ttttttttttttt texa tech lady raider tt ttt tt swc champion ttt ncaa national champion ttt ttttttt
