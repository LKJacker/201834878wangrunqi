from dlecoint subject re sabbath admission someone send me thi faq by e-mail and i post my response here i not enforce the inclusion limit on thi faq because most of my reader probably have see it clh christ warn that anyone who break one of the least of these commandment and teach othere to do the same will be call least in the kingdom of heaven matt thi faq be so full of error that i must respond to it i hope that whoever maintain will remove from it the partisan theology brother and sister being new to the faith and examine the decalogue closely i notice the fourth commandment be pretty specific about keep the sabbath day it state the day saturday be the sabbath while most christian religion keep or atleast go to church on sunday what up thi be a frequently ask question every time it arise it cause month of debate so let me see if i can answer you directly basically it because the law wa give to mosis a part of a specific covenanent with the jew most of u be jew so we be part of that covenant there wa an argument early in christian history about whether the mosaic law should apply to gentile who become christian you can see the account of thi debate in act the main question there wa circumcision but keep the sabbath would be part of it a well the apostle conclude that we need not become jew in order to become christian and therefore that rule such a circumcision do not apply to u the law wa know to man before it wa reveal on mount sinai rom note that where no law be there be no transgression not only do sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath wa keep before it wa reveal on sinai ex the problem with the first covenant wa not the law but the promise which undergird it god want to perform hi will in the life of the person but in their ignorance after year of slavery they promise what ever he say to do we will do that be why the new covenant be base on better promise heb rather than do away with the law god promise to put my law in their mind and write them on their heart heb including the sabbath in the act be selective inclusion the sabbath wa more important to the jew than circumcision if any attempt have be make to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have be even more strident than be record in act do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbath which could occur at any time of the week and be part of the law ceremonial which wa add because of transgression of the moral law gal israel stand for god person of all time that be why god graft the gentile in roma say that the adoption the glory the covenant the give of the law the service of god and the promise belong to israelite in explanation paul make it clear that be bear into israel be not enough for they be not all israel which be of israel v then in gal he say if ye be christ then be ye abraham seed and heir accord to the promise all christian be abraham seed jew israelite not physically for that be not the criterion but spiritually we be joint heir with jesu base on the promise god make to all hi person the israelite while christian agree that the ot law do not all apply to u because some of them be part of a specific covenanent with the jew we also expect to see some similarity between the thing god expect from the jew and the thing he expect from u after all it the same god however there be several way of deal with thi these day the most common approach be to separate the ot commandment into moral and ceremonial ceremonial commandment apply only to the jew they be part of the specific mosaic covenant these be thinsg like the kosher law and circumcision moral law apply to everyone most of the command be part of the moral law except for the commandment about the sabbath i believe most person who take thi approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on the sabbath be part of the ceremonial law but a general obligation to worship regularly be part of the general moral law thu christian be free to choose the specific time we worship person would probably agree but they be wrong how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it be part of a law which predate the ceremonial law you be not free to choose ymy time of worship even if you be why do you follow a day of worship which ha it origin in pagan sun worship would you rather give up a day which god bless sanctify and hallow in exchange for one which all church leader agree ha not biblical foundation see sabbath admission in a more radical approach which be generally connect with john calvin and the reformed tradition say that the law a a whole be no longer bind instead we be entirely under grace and my behavior should be guide solely by love portion of the ot law be still useful a guidance but they be not properly speak legally bind on u in practice most person who take thi position do not believe it be safe to leave christian without moral guidannce while we may no longer be under law a sinner it not safe for u to go into situation with no principle to guide u we too good at self-justification for that to be safe thu christian do have moral guidance from thing like jesu teach paul advice etc these may not be precisely a law but they serve much the same function a and have largely the same content a the moral law in the previou analysi while calvin would deny that we have a fix legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that give human weaknes the discipline of regular worship be important i do not care what calvin or any theologian say my guide be what god say if be not under the law mean we do not have to keep the law why be it that the only section of the law we have trouble with be the sabbath commandment which be the only one god think wa important enough to say remember if you study the word deeply you will note that the message be that we be no longer under the condemnation of the law but free by the grace of god if a cop pull me over for speed then in court i ask for mercy and the judge do not throw the book at me but gife me grace do i walk out of the court say i can now go on speed for i be now under grace being under grace i now drive within the speed limit paul add to it in rom di we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law wherefore the law be holy and the commandment holy and just and good rom in both analysis the specific day be not an issue a a matter of tradition we worship on sunday a a memorial of christ resurrection there some debate about what act show about early christian worship the most common analysi be that be show jewish christian continue to go to jewish service on the sabbath but that specifically christian service be not necessarily hold then act show worship on the first day sunday and i cor also imply gather on that day there be a few group that continue to believe christian have to worship on the sabbath saturday the best-known be the seventh-day adventist and jehovah witness they argue that act be not a regular worship service but a special meet to see paul off and that i cor do explicitly say it a regular worship service do you prefer implication to fact a careful study of the act show that the meet wa on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul do not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to asso in icor there be no way you can equate lay by him in store with go to a worship service it clear that thi issue wa a contest one in paul time see rom paul advice be that we should be very careful about judge each other on issue like thi one person see a specific day a mandate by god while another do not he who observe that specific day do it in honor of the lord he who believe hi worship be free of such restriction also do it in honor of the lord those who believe that the sabbath be still mandate argue that paul be not refer to sabbath worship here note however col which say something similar but briefer it explicitly mention sabbath wrong these be the sabbath day of the ceremonial law not the sabbath day of the moral law there be some difference among christian about use of the word sabbath originally the term refer to the day the jewish day of worship many christian now use it to refer to sunday the day of christian worship they do thi largely so that they can apply the or whatever there be a couple of different number scheme commandment to it reformed tradition do not do thi it distinguish between the sabbath which be the observance mandate for jew and the lord day which be the free christian worship the only reference i can find to thi in the nt be rev there be also difference about law regard thi day many christian support blue law both in secular law and church law set aside that day and cause person to spend it in worship the more radical anti-legal approach see such regulation a a return to the jewish sabbath which be not appropriate to the free christian worship of the lord day why would you prefer to twist and turn rely on different argument which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a god who love you enough to die for you jesu die because the law could not be change why bother to die in order to meet the demand of a break law if all you need to do be change the law penalty for law break mean the law be immutable that be why it be no sin not to follow the demand of the ceremonial law it will alway be a sin to make false god to violate god name to break the sabbath to steal to kill etc except it you disagree but then ymy opinion ha no weight when place next to the word of god dariu it not clear how much more need to be say other than the faq i think paul comment on esteem one day over another rom be probably all that need to be say i accept that dariu be do what he do in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all day alike be similarly do their best to honor the lord however i like to be clear that i do not think there unambiguou proof that regular christian worship wa on the first day a i indicate there be response on both of the passage cite the difficulty with both of these passage be that they be actually about something else they both look like they be talk about nnregular christian meet but neither explicitly say and they gather every sunday for worship we get variou piece of information but nothing aim at answer thi question act describe christian a participate both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion service in home obviously the temple worship be on the sabbath act be an example of christian participate in them unfortunately it do tell u what day christian meet in their house act despite dariu confusion be describe by act a occur on sunday i see no reason to impose modern definition of when day start when the biblical text be clear about what wa mean the word imply to me that thi wa a normal meet it do say they gather to see paul off but that when they be gather for break bread paul talk about hi upcoming travel but that just not explicit enough to be really convince similarly with cor it say that on the first day they should set aside money for paul collection now if you want to believe that they gather specially to do thi or that they do it in their home i ca disprove it but the obviou time for a congregation to take an offer would be when they normally gather for worship and if they be expect to do it in their home there would be no reason to mention a specific day so i think the most obviou read of thi be that on the first day of every week simply mean every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implication and not clear statement be that the nt author assume that their reader know when christian worship wa clh
