from pharvey paul harvey subject re sabbath admission in article clh write re are you christian or pauline both sure why not but be you use paul to correct the word of jesu there be no doubt in my mind about what be sin and what be not at least not in thi case jesu do not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law wa bind on gentile so anyone who dissolf even one of the smallest command and teach other the same way will be know a the lowest in the kingdom of the sky wherea anyone who keep the command and teach them too will be know a someone great in the kingdom of the sky gau are you an anyone or be you a no one why not assume that since jesu do say that hi word apply only to jew that they apply to all human be irregardles of race or sex why not assume that even though jesu do not mention ymy name still jesu wa talk directly to you that why i have to cite evidence such a the way jesu deal with the centurion a to general jewish view on thi i be dependent largely on study of pauline theology one by schoep and one whose author i ca come up with at the moment both author be jew also variou christian and non-christian jew have discuss the issue here and in other newsgroup mat be clear that the law be still valid it do not say that it apply to gentile do it say that it apply to you are you anyone or no one and ye i say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandment be a ceremonial detail when you look at the obligation of gentile jp remember the sabbath day and keep it holy six day you shall labor and do all ymy work but the seventh day be a sabbath of the lord ymy god you shall not do any work you ymy son or daughter ymy male or female slave or ymy cattle or the stranger who be within ymy settlement for in six day the lord make heaven and earth and sea and all that be in them and he rest on the seventh day therefore the lord bless the sabbath day and hollow it note there be no specific requirement for worship here however i for one would not be so bold a to call these verse a ceremonial detail similarly circumcision do many christian still practice circumcision i not sure quite what else i can say on thi subject again it unfortunate the jesu do answer the question directly it unfortunate that jesu do use ymy name directly or maybe jesu do are you somebody or nobody however we do know what the cent jewish approach wa how jesu deal with at least one gentile and how jesu disciple deal with the issue when it become more acute i refer to act more than paul given that these be all in agreement i do see that there a big problem if you do see a problem then perhap there be none a paul close roman gau in short pursue the end of peace and of build each other up do let dietary consideration undo the work of god everything may be clean but it evil for the person who eat it in an offensive spirit better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else ymy brother be offend by a for the faith that you have keep that between yourself and god the person be in luck who do condemn himself for what he sample on the other hand the person with doubt about something who eat it anyway be guilty because he be act on hi faith and any failure to act on faith be a sin a far a i know christian except specific jewish christian group and maybe some of the sabbatarian both of which be very small group do not practice circumcision on religiou grind in some country it ha be do for suppose health reason but i not hear it argue that it be be do because of the biblical commandment clh
