from scott scott holt subject hate the sin hate the sin but love the sinner i hear that quite a bite recently often in the context of discussion about christianity and homosexuality but the context really be that important my question be whether that statement be consistent with christianity i would think not hate beget more hate never love consider some sin i leave it unnamed since i do want thi to digres into an argument a to whether or not something be a sin now let apply my hate the sin philosophy and see what happen if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the stronger my hatred of it will become eventually thi hate become so strong that we become disgust with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner in addition my hatred of the sin often cause u to say and do thing which be take personally by the sinner who often do not even believe what they be do be a sin after enough of thi the sinner begin to hate u they certainly do love u for my constant criticism of their behavior hate build up and drife person away from god thi certainly can not be a good way to build love in the summary of the law christ command u to love god and to love my neighbor he do say anything about hate in fact if anything he command u to save my criticism for ourself so how be christian suppose to deal with the sin of other i suppose that there be only one way to deal with sin either in other or ourself through prayer we need to ask god to help u with my own sin and to help those we love with their only love can conquer sin hatred ha no place the best way to love someone be to pray for them scott thi be my signature there be many like it but thi one be mine scott holt internet scott georgia tech uucp gatech prism scott office of information technology technical service
