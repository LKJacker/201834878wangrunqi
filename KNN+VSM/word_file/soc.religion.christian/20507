from reid jon reid subject re prophetic warning to new york city evensont evenson thoma randall write ye i suppose it be true that person make mistake it be interest to note that in those long ago ot day if you be correct in ymy prophecy person get very mad and you be no longer believe even put to death thi be one of the difference between ot prophecy and nt prophecy in the nt it be expect that when believer gather person will prophesy the prophecy must be judge cor there be nothing about kill someone who make a mistake to say that we make mistake be true to say that we make mistake while fill with the spirit be not true were that true the entire bible have be write by man inspire by god would be subject also to those error for what be prophecy but like those revelation give in scripture scripture be scripture there be no gift of scripture and i do know about you but i know that i have make mistake while fill with the spirit if you do give grace to allow person to make mistake they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gift when we minister in my small group i encourage person to speak out any impression or image they think might be from the lord only by try will they know whether they be right or wrong and in either case they have a better handle on it the next time did you fall when you be learn to ride a bicycle but you keep on try and you learn both from ymy failure and ymy success spiritual gift be no different you get better with experience which bring me around to ask an open question is the bible a close book of scripture is it okay for u to go around say god tell me thi and jesu tell me that would that imply that god be still pour out new revelation to u i know that some person will feel that be okay and some will not the concept of a close canon would certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophet on the other hand an open canon seem to be indicate sometime the canon of scripture be complete do thi mean that god no longer speak i have hear hi voice not audibly though some have but clearly nonetheles is what i hear equivalent to scripture no i have never hear contemporary prophet claim that what they receive from the lord be on the same level a scripture on the contrary those who be mature obey the scripture by submit their prophecy to fellow believer for judgement and the most reliable yardstick for judge prophecy be certainly the scripture themself the canon be close but god be not silent also interest to note be that some so call prophecy be nothing new but rather an inspire translation of scripture is it right to call that prophecy misleading would that be more have to do with knowledge i know the gift of knowledge may not be a excite to talk about but should we call a horse a horse do it matter what it be call the question be not how to label it but how to receive it word of knowledge incidentally be similar to prophecy and sometime the two overlap but generally it be supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be know otherwise jon reid he be no fool who gife what he can not keep reid to gain what he can not lose jim elliot
