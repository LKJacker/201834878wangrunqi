from poram mlsma subject re deuterocanonical esp sirach andrew continue the discussion on the deuterocanonical in article revdak d andrew kille write poram write let talk about principle if we accept that god set the standard for what ought to be include in scripture then we can ask is it authoritative authoritative be not a quality of the write itself it be a statement by the community of faith whether it will accept the write a normative arguably it be both since authority be a matter of both communicator and recepiant we can say that for example jesu be lord whether the world at large accept the authority or not thu the bible can be consider for it authoritative content whether or not it be accept thi issue be at the heart of pilate pragmatic question what be truth to jesu when my lord wa bring before him jesu reply wa to appeal to the authority of hi father you also might like to consider the claim authority represent by the statement thu say the lord in the bible which claim to put acros the exact word of god you fall into the danger of relativism with ymy rejection of inherant authority and claim that it ly only in the community of faith do something become truth because it be accept the main thrust of my argument be that there be a godward direction a well a a manward which be where the reference to rev come in is it prophetic how be prophecy to be define if it be speak forth of god message much of the apocrypha must surely qualify if we narrow it down to the predictive element which will cut out some of the accept ot book a well we nonetheles have criterium for determine the validity of the book jesu standard be that scripture can not be break can you name a single prophecy that fit the bill in the apocrapha ie definitely fulfil after it ha be write is it authentic again by what standard is authenticity a function of the author the historical accuracy do it have a subjective of truth about it and do other evidence that ha come to light contradict or confirm the authenticity archaeological other textual evidence for example is it dynamic what be thi suppose to mean many of the apocryphal book be highly dynamic think provoke faithful even excite what thi be get at be the relationship between text and reader it be to do with the quality of write which should have the ability to fire the mind affect my think life and cause u to act in a certain way there be something of thi in jesu quote man do not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of the lord matt is it receive collect read and use by whom of course the apocryphal book be receive by some collect or else we would not have them read and use and they still be in the catholic and orthodox church do the catholic church give the same authority to the apocrapha a to the accept book certainly it be not a widely use a the ot and nt on these count the apocrapha fall short of the glory of god thi be demonstrably false think about what i have say above you may want to revise ymy conclusion in addition think about other write eg the koran the book of mormon and how and why you would categorise them use the above principle one word of caution you may find some glory in some of these book in that the quality may be derive from the bible remember that lucifer be quite capable of appear a an angel of light and quote scripture to quote unger bible dictionary on the apocrapha they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracy and anachronism so do other book of the bible what be you think of deletion how do you then view the word i warn everyone who hear the word of the prophecy of thi book if anyone add anything to them god will add to him the plague describe in thi book and if anyone take away from thi book the prophecy god will take away from him hi share in the tree of life and in the holy city rev surely thi set the standard and not just man-made tradition these word clearly be mean to refer to the book of revelation alone not to the whole body of scripture revelation itself wa accept very late into the canon the church simply do not see it a have a primary role of any kind in identify and limit scripture we lose the point and the context here i be not argue that the statement in rev can be apply indescriminately just that the whole idea do not just follow on from man-made tradition but there be i believe an act of god involve in the selection and criterium of what be classify a scripture and come under the definition of revdak barney resson many shall run to and fro knowledge shall increase daniel
