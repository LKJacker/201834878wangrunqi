from jemurray john e murray subject quality of catholic liturgy i would like the opinion of netter on a subject that ha be bother my wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last few year it seem that there be more and more ad hoc event during mas it drive me crazy the most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition be that what happen be something we all do together because we all know how to do it led by the priest of course which make it a kind of dialogue we present to god but the best mass i be to be participatory prayer lately i think the proportion of participation ha fall and the proportion of sit there and watch or listen or generally be tell what to do which be necessary because no one know what happen next be grow example last sunday palm sunday we go to the local church usually on palm sunday the congregation participate in read the passion take the role of the mob the theology behind thi seem profound when we say crucify him we mean it we do it and if he come back today we do it again it alway gife me chill but last week we be invite to sit during the gospel passion and listen beside the orwellian invitation i wa really sadden to have my and my little role take away thi seem typical of a shift of participation away from the person and toward the musician reader and so on new thing be introduce in the course of the liturgy and since no one know what happen the new thing have to be explain and pretty soon instead of do a lot of the mas we just sit there listen or space out in my case to how the mas be about to be do in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committee make up of lay expert but that may not be just i do think that a liturgy committee ha a bia toward do something rather than nothing that just a fact of bureaucratic life even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for person to be aware of the lord presence so we be wonder be we the oddball or be the quality of the mas go down i do mean that facetiously we go to mas every thursday or friday and be remind of the power of a very simple liturgy to make u aware of god presence but a far a the obligatory sunday mass maybe i should just offer it up ha anyone else notice decline congregational participation in catholic mass lately john murray
