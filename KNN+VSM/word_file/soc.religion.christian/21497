from aaronc aaron bryce cardena subject baptism require faith it trouble me that there have be so many post recently try to support the doctrine of original sin thi be primarily a catholic doctrine with no other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism even among it supporter however person will stop short of say that unbaptised infant will go to hell it very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine however if we have the heart to persevere in my belief to make sure that they be biblically base then we can come to an understand of the truth let now take a more complete look at scripture colossian in him you be also circumcise in the put off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision do by christ have be bury with him in baptism and raise with him through ymy faith in the power of god who raise him from the dead in baptism we be raise to a new life in christ roman through a personal faith in the power of god my parent faith can not do thi do infant have faith let look at what the bible ha to say about it roman but not all the israelite accept the good news for isaiah say who ha believe my message consequently faith come from hear the message and the message be hear through the word of christ so then we receive god gift of faith to u a we hear the message of the gospel faith be a possible response to hear god word preach kid be not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to god word hence they can not have faith and therefore can not be raise in baptism to a new life ezekiel the soul who sin will die the son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son the righteousnes of the righteou man will be credit to him and the wickednes of the wicked will be charge against him if you read all of ezekiel you will see that god do hold u guilty for anyone else sin so we can have no original guilt from adam ezekiel rid yourself of all the offense you have committted and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o house of israel for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declare the sovereign lord repent and live the way to please god be to repent and get a new heart and spirit kid can not do thi act say that when we repent and be baptize we will then receive a new spirit the holy spirit then we shall live now then that we have a little more background a to why original sin be not biblical let look at some of the scripture use to support it roman therefore just a sin enter the world through one man and death through sin and in thi way death come to all man because all sin sin and death enter the world when the first man sin death come to each man because each man sin note that it good to read through all of roman some of the verse be easier to misunderstand than other but if we read them in context we will see that they be all say basically the same thing let look at one such roman for just a through the disobedience of the one man the many be make sinner so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be make righteou through the disobedience of each individual each wa make a sinner in the same way through the obedience of jesu each will be make righteou we must remember when read through thi passage that death come to each man only because each man sin not because of guilt from adam otherwise the bible would contradict itself i encourage you to read through thi whole passage on ymy own look at it from thi point of view to see if it do all fit together psalm surely i wa sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceive me thi whole psalm be a wonderful example of how we should humble ourself before god in repentance for sin david himself wa a man after god own heart and write the psalm after commit adultry with bathsheba and murder her husband all that david be say here be that he ca remember a time when he wa sinful he be humble himself before god by confess hi sinfulnes hi say that he wa sinful at birth be a hyperbole the bible be inspire by god be limit to a literal interpetation but also use figure of speech a do jesu john for another example of hyperbole see luke now then even though person see that baptism require faith and that original sin be not biblical they will still argue that infant baptism be necessary because child sin by be selfish not share toy with other child by be mean hit other and fight etc certainly we have observe child do wrong thing but my gut feel be alway that they do know any better let look to see if the bible agree with my gut feel isaiah therefore the lord himself will give you a sign the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him immanuel he will eat curd and honey when he know enough to reject the wrong and choose the right now just about any church leader will tell you that thi be a prophecy about jesu if they do then point them to matthew and find a new leader jesu certainly could have have le knowledge than normal human baby yet thi passage say that he have to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and wrong we see that he do grow and become wiser in luke and the implication be that jesu do wrong thing a a child before he know to choose right over wrong since we know that jesu wa perfect without sin we have rather conclusive proof that baby can not sin because they do know to choose the right instead of the wrong jesu himself wa baptize albeit with john baptism not a an infant but a a thirty-year-old man luke and start hi ministry a soon a he wa baptize luke immediately afterward he wa tempt by the devil luke matthew mark thank you for ymy attention moderator thi should finish up the subject for a while perhap you would like to make a faq out of thi response so that you can repost it from time to time when the topic come up feel free to rearrange the content if you would like to but please send me a copy of the final faq sincerely aaron cardena aaronc i think you overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of ymy response first original sin be not a catholic-only doctrine it wa hold by luther and calvin a well and be still present in one form or another in the lutheran and reformed tradition second say that it ha no other purpose than defend infant baptism be an ad hominem argument which ha considerable evidence against it the original baptist theology include original sin and some baptist still hold it and there be certainly group that baptize infant without believe in original sin among protestant the sacrament tend to be a bite more symbolic than among catholic protestant who baptize infant see baptism a a sign of god acceptance of u rather than my acceptance of god in traditional protestant theology god grace precede my response and be applicable to child there be a number of passage one can cite to indicate that god accept even child clh
