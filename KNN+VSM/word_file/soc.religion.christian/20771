from vbv virgilio dean b velasco jr subject re the arrogance of christian in article caralv carol alvin write vbv virgilio dean b velasco jr write hold it i say that all of scripture be true however discern exactly what jesu paul and company be try to say be not alway so easy i do believe that paul wa try to say that all woman should behave that way rather he wa try to say that under the circumstance at the time the woman he wa speak to would best avoid volubility and cover their head thi ha to do with maintain a proper witnes toward other remember that any number of relativistic statement can be derive from absolute for instance it be absolutely right for christian to strive for peace however thi do not rule out try to maintain world peace by resort to violence on occasion ye my opinion i agree that there be truth in scripture there be principle to be learn from it claiming that that truth be absolute though seem to imply a literal read of the bible if it be absolute truth constant acros time culture etc then no interpretation would be necessary i strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation that because truth may be absolute but it may not be obviou like so many thing the truth be alway subject to misinterpretation i strongly suspect that we be reach an impasse here which be why i deign from comment much further sure the bible preach absolute truth however exactly what those truth be be sometime a matter of confusion a i say the bible do preach absolute truth sometime those fundamental principle be crystal clear at least to evangelical thi be where the arrogance come in to play since these principle be crystal clear to evangelical maybe the rest of u should just take their word for it maybe it be at all crystal clear to me that their fundamental principle be either fundamental or principle now hold it i never say that christian can not be arrogant indeed a many other christian on src have stress before thi be a trap that christian must alway be wary about however thi do not mean that if you believe in the absolute establish by the bible you be necessarily be arrogant a christian can believe that the word of god be absolute but he or she should not expect thi to be immediately evident to everyone so i think that ymy position be the bible be absolute truth but a we be prone to error in my interpretation we can not reliably determine if we have figure out what that truth be did i get that right not quite you say that accord to my stance we can not reliably determine what be true that be not what i say i say that a fallible human be we can not discern the truth with certainty the distinction be subtle yet important when a scientist perform an experiment he can claim that hi result be reliable without claim that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have be make in other word he can admit that he could be mistake without sacrifice hi conviction nobody can establish what absolute truth be with certainty throughout the century philosopher have argue about what we can know with complete certainty and what we can not descarte make a step in the right direction when he utter cogito ergo sum yet we have not advance much beyond that do you believe that other person aside from you exist do you believe that the computer terminal you be use exist if so can you be absolutely certain about that are you sure it be not some grand illusion of course you have no such assurance thi do not mean however that for all practical purpose you can be certain that they exist so it be with christianity the most mature christian i know have deep conviction about absolute morality yet they acknowledge that there be a non-zero probability that they be wrong thi do not however mean that they should or do abandon these absolute what the point of spend all thi time claim and defend absolute truth when we can never know what those truth be and we can never or at least should act upon them what practical difference can thi make a i say we can never be absolutely certain that we be correct thi do not mean that we can not be certain enough in light of the evidence to render all doubt unreasonable virgilio dean velasco jr department of electrical and applied physic cwru graduate student roboticist-in-training and q wannabee bullwinkle that man intimidate a referee my bos be a not very well he do look like one at all jewish carpenter
