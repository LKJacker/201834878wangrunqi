from aaronc aaron bryce cardena subject re christian and aid paul conditt write ye it important to realize that all action have consequence and that rule be make for my own good but to suggest that a disease be a punishment for certain type of sin i think be take thing much too far text delete ye sin can have terrible consequence but we need to be real careful when say that the consequence be a punishment for sin i wish that you have follow thi thread before jump to conclusion i have see anybody write that aid wa a punishment for certain type of sin thi include mark ashley who you be respond to here i myself write that when you do do thing god way that curse will come on you and other although one definition of be i only mean or misfortune when i use the word because god love u he ha tell u the best way to live in hi bible god do cause curse he warn u of them kevin davi write a while ago last week i wa guilty of anger jealousy and whole me of other stuff yet i be forgive and not condemn to suffer with aid to even suggest that aid be deserve be ludicrou the bible make it clear that we all equally deserve death which be much worse than aid we have all hurt god with my sin paul conditt reveal hi feel in case you could tell i get extremely angry and upset when i see thing like thi instead of rationalize my own fear and phobia we need to be reach out to person with aid and other socially unacceptable disease whether they get the disease through their own action or not be irrelevant they still need jesu the first issue you bring up be ymy anger it be obviou ly wrong to be angry gal for any reason especially extremely angry which be on par with hatred jesu ha every reason to be angry at u for put him on the cro with my sin yet hi prayer wa forgive them father they know not what they do knowing how forgive jesu ha be with me call me to be more forgive with everyone out of love for him please do give in to anger it will only cause foolish quarrel and more bad feel it okay if you read something that bother you but you need to addres it in a love way if right now i felt like someone out there wa say that god punish gay or sexually immoral person with aid because they deserve punishment that other do then i would frame a response something like thi it make me feel very sad for someone to believe that aid which be simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other be god punishment for person who have commit certain sin god love all of hi child equally and rejoice when a single one come back to him we will all be judge after we die but until then we all have the opportunity to accept god grace by earnestly seek after him with all of my heart believe the gospel testimony repent of my sin confess that jesu be lord at baptism and live a new life for him let u not judge someone to be eternally condemn god arm be not to short to save he will do anything he can to move a harden heart or a mislead person he work for the good of all man even through the worst of situation he ha set the time and place for all man that they may perhap reach out and find him the second issue you bring up be see person rationalize their fear of person with aid fortunately what you describe a see be actually misperceive you have be miss the point make in the earlier post and react in anger to attitude that have be express i know that it sometime hard to discount ymy perception but please try to be open-minded you be quite correct in say that we should reach out to all person because they all need jesu thi be what my brother and sister and i do on a daily basi if you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in i will find and get you in touch with some brother who have aid or know person with aid and live nearby you so that you can see the love attitude for yourself the third issue you bring up be the importance of how some individual contract aid how someone get aid be only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involve the important point to be make however be that not listen to god command or advice or warn sin cause harm or misfortune to yourself and other for thi reason a good way to prevent the misfortune of aid which can be transmit in sinful way be to listen to god advice and have sex only with ymy wife or husband i hope that you be feel better now paul love aaron cardena
