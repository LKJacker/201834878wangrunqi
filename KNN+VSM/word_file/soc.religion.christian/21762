from mserv mail server subject secret ceremoney wa re mormon temple shellgate llo larry l overacker write in article mserv mail server write i do necessarily object to the secrecy but i do question it since i see no biblical reason why any aspect of christian worship should involve secrecy early in church history the catechumen be dismiss prior to the celebration of the eucharist it wa secret give rise to the rumor that christian be cannibal and all sort of perverse claim the action be consider too holy to be observe by non-christian a well a potentially dangerou for the individual christian who might be identify larry overacker llo sig delete for brevity larry thank for the reply but thi be quite the same thing like i say before i can understand why non-christian would be deny acces to holy ceremoney but the ceremony itself communion wa not secret in fact all fmy gospel record the first break of the bread in some detail communion wa a fellowship meal and it wa and still should be in my opinion inappropriate to invite those who do not share in the fellowship of the body of christ the fact that unbeliever deny acces to these communal meal begin to imagine all sort of secret and debase ritual during communion do not by any mean imply that the early christian be in fact hide shameful thing from the general public in fact i think if you read some of the early church father you will find that they be not at all bashful about describe what go on during communion that why it seem funny to me when mormon who claim to be the only true restoration of century christianity insist on hide certain ritual on the grind that they be too sacred mark actually that not quite the case john omit the central element of the last supper hi gospel be full of symbolism of bread and wine but the actual story be there some person think he ha omit some of the detail because they be not talk about in public in hi community there be also evidence that some aspect of baptismal practice be keep secret see morton smith secret gospel i do agree with hi lurid speculation on what the secret practice actually be but there do seem to be some evidence that mark omit certain detail because they be inappropriate for publication clh
