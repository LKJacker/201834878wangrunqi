from jayne jayne kulikauska subject what in a name the sequel i be think about the idea that wa raise by michael covington i think that word mean what we think they mean regardles of etymology i be reflect on what certain word mean in my childhood and trace how thi shape some of my attitude i grow up in a home where christ wa a bad word person who be very angry say it the word christian mean someone who wa not a jew it carry connotation of othernes of threat of enemy it take some time to figure out that there wa a connection between christ and christian when i accept jesu i expect to be disown to become a christian mean to join the enemy i know other would consider me a traitor at some level i agree but wa still prepare to pay thi price like esau i sell my birthright however i make a better bargain he only get some stew but i get the incomparable rich of know christ a it turn out my parent do not disown me i find out later that they be hop it wa a phase that i would grow out of by the time they have decide it wa a phase they be sort of use to it they do disown me but they do completely accept the situation either for example they do come to my wed because it wa in a church when i visit my grandmother in the hospital a few day before her death she say to me a far a i concern you still be a jew what she mean wa that she love me and forgive me but i be not a jew i be a christian i concede one that like chicken soup with matzoh ball i do not keep kosher i do not celebrate the sabbath on saturday my son be not circumcise but these thing be true of some person who do consider themself jew it be not these rule that make person jew it be the heritage from the past i give up the past thi be why i find it hard to relate to messianic jew their experience be unlike mine they still consider themself jew while follow jesu some would even say that i must do so too i be at a stage of my life now where i would like to have a heritage it wa not something i value very much when i give it but i do have a sense that i wa give it for god it may have be a small sacrifice it may have be an unnecessary sacrifice but i give it and do not want to ask for it back and while i do have the heritage i wa bear with i do have another i be an outcast from the house of israel but i be a member of the church one of the thing i like about be a catholic christian be that it be rich in tradition it gife me a feel of once again be root in the past thi be probably one of the reason why i do like it when person me around with christian tradition for example change the name of easter these tradition fill an important emotional need of mine i suppose the point of all thi be that person should assume that all believer of jewish background be the same for some jewish christian be a good name for other it be an oxymoron jayne
