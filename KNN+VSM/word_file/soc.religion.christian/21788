from ldiel leisa diel subject info need ok let me see if i can get all thi out concisely i be on an information gather venture regard the variou expression of there be my husband and i come from very different but completely christian background i wa a lutheran when i meet him and he wa a bear and raise church of christ member at first i agree with a lot of what the c of c wa about i want to move from the liturgical base lutheran church to something a little more biblical base however over the last year i be regret change to the church of christ for a number of reason for one thing i be not a fundamentalist and believe that a few thing in the bible be socio-cultural in nature and do relate to the christian doctrine one of my sorest spot be the role of woman i believe that through mary and other woman chri validate woman a worthy disciple but in the c of c the write of paul be take without exception and i be tell that i be not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member i be to submit to my husband in all thing if i hear that verse one more time and i be not to take an active role in anything which might be construe a put me in authority over man ie lead prayer conduct bible study etc the last straw wa when the elder at my church come down on one of my college group because it wa all-woman and they want a man to lead the study also my husband and i really resent the way everyone at my church feel that if you be a conservative republican you be a real christian i get tell that nobody who vote for clinton should call themself a christian hence we be subject during the service to long prayer call for thing we flatly dont agree with we be also do agree with the c of c dread of any new movement be lead by the young person so we have be church hunt with no succes i want a reasonably biblical base church where woman be view a whole person no matter what their call c of c really look down on career woman christopher be look for a church with deeply root religiou conviction with adult baptism and a church where the member still bring their bible to service we be so confuse here and we drift around try to find a place where we both feel love and can expres my faith honestly and without reservation if anyone can point u in a direction we be thrill i afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to c of c and even harder for me to stay churchles for long any response would be welcome the diel family i would think somewhere in the baptist spectrum you might find what you look for however the issue be probably more one of the flavor of the specific local church in ymy area than the denomination baptist cover quite a spectrum adult baptism sort of narrow ymy choice on the more liberal end of the spectrum historically that be associate with movement that have the character you try to avoid clh
