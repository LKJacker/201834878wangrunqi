from kempmp petrus pihko subject re atheist view on christianity wa re accepting jeesu in ymy heart jason smith jason write the discussion begin why do the universe exist at all one of the law of nature specify cause and effect seem to dictate at least to thi layman mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exist i would argue that causality be actually a property of spacetime cause precede their effect but if you claim that there must be an answer to how do the universe my spacetime emerge from nothing science ha some good candidate for an answer i have alway wonder why christian use the there be question science or atheism can not answer argument i hope thi be the appropriate group to ask thi question the most popular question be the question of origin why do the universe exist or anything for that matter i think thi question should actually be split into two part namely why be there existence why anything exist and how do the universe emerge from nothing it be clear science ha nothing to say about the first question however be it a meaningful question after all i would say it be consider the follow a die-hard skeptic be be it human or whatever attempt to doubt one very existence since it be so easy to doubt everything else i can not be sure the world exist it may be my mind fool me can i ever be sure i exist however it be only possible to exist or not to exist someone insert an appropriate shakespeare quote here a be that do not exist can not doubt one existence a be that do exist can doubt one existence but thi would be pointles the be would exist anyway let u return to the original question why a be that do not exist do not need any reason for it non-existence thi be be not sure whether anything else exist but hi mind but let u assume that the world exist independent of the mind the objectivity postulate the question why anything exist can be counter by demand answer to a question why there be nothing in nothingnes or in non-existence actually both question turn out to be devoid of mean thing that exist do and thing that do exist do exist tautology at it best i seriously doubt god could have an answer to thi question some christian i have talk to have say that actually god be himself the existence however i see several problem with thi answer first it inevitably lead to the conclusion that god be actually all existence good and evil devil and angel u and them thi be pantheism not christianity another answer be that god be the source of all existence thi sound much better but i be tempt to ask do god himself exist then if god be the source of hi own existence it can only mean that he ha in term of human time alway exist but thi be not the same a the source of all existence thi argument sound like god do not exist but meta-exist and from hi meta-existent perspective he create existence i think thi be actually a nonsolution a mere twist of word the best answer i have hear be that human reason be incapable of understand such question being an atheist myself i do not accept such answer since i do not have any other method the second question how do the universe emerge from nothing belong to the domain of science and i for one do not doubt the question can be answer by it method many cosmologist have suggest that it be entirely possible for universe to emerge from vacuum thi possibility ha be suggest in a recent hawking biography see also lizhi shuxian creation of the universe world scientific however i think the scus group be more appropriate for discussion like thi a far a i can tell the very law of nature demand a why that be true of something outside of nature thi be not true science be a collection of model tell u how not why something happen i can not see any good reason why the why question would be bind only to natural thing assume that the supernatural domain exist if supernatural be exist it be a appropriate to ask why they do so a it be to ask why we exist i believe the genetic code will be entirely decipher in my lifetime but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustain reproduce life ever i never be much of a prophet though i ca even picture new york in my mind i do believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite have all of the part available just my opinion thi opinion be also call vitalism namely that live system be somehow fundamentally different from inanimate system do christian in general adopt thi position what would happen when scientist announce they have create primitive life say small bacterium in a lab there be a problem with ymy prophecy artificial life ha be create although not yet in a chemical form computer simulation of evolution contain system that be a much alive a any bacterium although their code be electronic a well a their metabolism see a recent book steven levy artificial life the quest for a new creation jonathan cape london artificial chemical life be just around the corner after all no spark of life ha be find to be necessary live system do not violate any physical law a we know them you do mind if a few of u send up a prayer on ymy behalf during ymy research do you after all if we of christ be delude ourself you really have nothing to worry about eh exactly thi be why i think atheist should not post any evangelical atheist argument to group since person who seek to find peace in religion must be allow to gather together i would normally have ask these question in or but it seem many christian do not read these group petrus petrus pihko
