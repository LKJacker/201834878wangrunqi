from mussack christopher mussack subject re atheist and hell to summarize while question the sagacity of someone who say they would rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven know even one man would spend hi eternal life be scorch for hi wrongdoing i describe how horrible hell be and compare the above statement with jesu suffer on the cro in order to prevent person go to hell which kenneth engel challenge did thi happen to jesu i do think so not from what i hear he live one day of suffer and die if the wage of sin be the above paragraph then jesu did pay for my sin did he i will wimp out and admit that i never like the metaphor of jesu pay for my sin in the sense that many christian accept a literal the point be that god understand the suffer we go through not just intellectually like when we watch the somalian on tv but really understand he can feel my pain thi fact be manifest by jesu life we can argue that someone in history might have suffer more than jesu we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion we can think of case of betrayal and fruitles effort lead to worse despair but the main point be that jesu be in the trench with u he be in everyone whatever i do to the least of humanity i do to him and whatever i do for the least of humanity i do for him now to reconcile thi with the existence of hell be beyond my capability but that wa my goal i be surprise to see the moderator let thi one through thankfully my moderator be surprise but i seriously want a reasonable explanation for thi a i re-read thi i must admit that thi be more of a description of my faith than an explanation but perhap that all i can do hopefully that all i have to do chri mussack
