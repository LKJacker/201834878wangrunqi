from crep stephen a crep subject re the doctrine of original sin in article write if baby be not suppose to be baptise then why do the bible ever say so it never come right and say only person that know right from wrong or who be teach can be baptise thi be not a very sound argument for baptise baby it assume that if the bible do say specifically that you do need to do something then that must mean that you do need to do it i know there a specific term for thi form of logic but it escape me right now however if it be sound then you should be able to apply it thi way if the bible do specifically say that something be wrong then it must be ok which coincidentally lead perfectly into a question i often ponder thi be no le logical than the assumption that if something be not in the bible then it must not be do but i do really think that what he say anyway see below if slavery be immoral which i believe it be can i assume that everyone else in thi group do too why do jesu or any of the apostle speak out against it owning slave wa common practice back then paul speak about everything else that be immoral he apparently think it wa important enough to talk about thing like not be a drunkard why do anyone mention slavery if god moral be eternal and do change like the moral of society then it must have be just a immoral then a it be today what about the letter to philemon in it paul at least hint that a certain slave be release also slavery in those time wa not the same a the type of slavery we have in the i think a better comparison would be to indenture servitude i do really want to get into a discussion on slavery anyway although it do demonstrate ymy point i do think it be relevent because the original poster do not say that absence of specific condemenation prove something be not immoral back to the original poster assertion he be not in fact make the logical error of which you accuse him he state the fact that the bible do not say that baby can not be baptize also we know that the bible say that everyone must be baptize to enter heaven everyone include infant unles there be other scripture to the contrary an exception since there be no exception list in the bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the bible mean what it say that everyone must be baptize to enter heaven and so we baptize infant to summarize you accuse the original poster of say if something be not forbid by the bible then that prove it be ok if something can not be disproven it be true he rather seem to be assert that since the bible do not forbid you can not prove use the bible that it be not ok there be a difference between prove whether or not something can be prove or disproven there be theory on provability in the field of logic by the way and actually prove or disprove it the other logical error we must avoid fall into be the converse that if something can not be prove then it be false thi seem to be the error of many sola scriptura believer i think the only thing that can be prove here be that one can not use scripture alone to prove something either way about infant baptism although the evidence seem to me to favor it steve crep indiana university crep
