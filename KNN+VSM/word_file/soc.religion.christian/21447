from swf stan friesen subject re major view of the trinity in article you write ye my comment be long enough that i do want to repeat them here but i send them vium email back to the author certainly it wa not intend to be a description of three similar deity though i certainly see why it would look that way thank for the letter ymy comment help some a to the last comment i certainly realize that it wa not intend to sound that way i be still try to understand how a spiritual be colud truly be one and three at the same time all of the description of thi be either platonic or sound like special plead sort of they appear to be three seperate be in all way but really they be one trust me neither of these be acceptible to me the fact be so far the only description of the trinity that make any sense to me be the modalistic one such a modalistic monarchianism or economic trinitarianism i can accept that the three aspect be intrinsic to the nature of god so i perhap lean more toward the latter i be try here to see if anybody can come up with another description that be both orthodox and believable sarima formerly tdatirv sarima or i fear orthodox theologian have be overly in love with paradox to the extent that well-meaning person think they just flat-out confuse there no problem with thing be both and if the be different part of the father son and holy spirit be exactly part of god because part be thing distinguish by physical separation all three person be omnipresent so they be obviously be physically separate but they in some way different aspect mode or whatever of one god if you accept economic trinitarianism it possible that you do have any substantive difference with the standard view is it possible that you just do find the neo-platonic explanation illuminate clh
