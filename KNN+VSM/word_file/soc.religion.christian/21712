from ml michael siemon subject re homosexuality issue in christianity in djohnson darin johnson write ok what more important to gay christian sex or christianity i afraid i see that question a very tendentiou try rephrase it what more important to christian love of god or love of other human be to which of course the only conceivable answer be that the one be like the other i be deeply suspiciou of any flavor of christianity which would elevate one clause of the great commandment to a priority over the other such a to claim a conflict true we be tell to let the dead bury the dead to hate family rather than let it keep u from follow christ but the dichotomy here be not one between love of my fellow and love of god but of allow social construct to blind u to the presense of god it be particularly satanic to twist love of god in such a manner a to become an excuse to treat other a on a different level than the one who be so catch up in love of god the trouble come in the relation of human love and human sex ye it ha sometime be the case that the church ha teach that all sex wa nasty evil sinful stuff but when man and wife leave their parental home to become helpmate live in one flesh it be the sex that be the vehicle of become one flesh if you doubt me read st paul on what be wrong with frequent prostitute les provocatively what i mean be just thi sexual bond be a deeply found aspect of my social interaction and in particular be the foundation of the institution of marriage so that unlike with many mammal human male remain with and foster the child they beget and support their child mother thi be the schema behind genesi and behind jesu citation of that passage i observe by the way that not all human male in fact do a i have just describe but another thing that characterize human society be my raise of child not only orphan and adoptee and the like but product of the quite common infidelity of human to their spouse we be in thi not unique in the animal world but the full extent of social consequence and implication be most intricate for u ye of course it sometime go wrong like all else we do it be infect with sin and you find marry couple where there be no bond and person so deliriously addict to the initial stage of sexual bond formation the infatuation fall in love phase that they break any form bond in order to keep step over the threshold of the deep unity god ha prepare for u and step back out again right away satan may indeed use sex a a very handy tool to corrupt human love but in the edenic creation that be not it nature and with god grace under the power of christ to make all thing new it need not be a problem for christian though we must be vigilant even in christ a the devil be watchful prowl around like a roar lion seek someone to devmy so return to the original question what be more important to straight christian sex or christianity paul clearly tend to think that sex wa at best a distraction from christianity though to be charitable to him hi context wa in expectation of immediate parousium so that the hard task of a marry union the lifelong build and adaptation to each other seem somehow to undercut the proper preparation for an immediate eschaton since we do not know the hmy of return we should act both with instant readines for that and with a commitiment to my mate that propose a long lifetime together and tell person not to bond in such a perspective strike me a cripple u in the second clause of the the commandment to love i would claim that only a very few saint have the capacity to deeply love without sexual tinge or complication mind you their fellow human be unles they have have a deeply spiritual life in marry union grow together a one flesh and that mean in the type case with a persistent and continue sexual relationship we be human and little good come of try to mortify the flesh to the point of pretend to be otherwise pretend not to be sexual be christianity i would hope would they be will to forgo sex completely in order to avoid be a stumble block to other it depend entirely on context if that context be major hypocrisy on the part of those who find u stumble block i be much le of a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about my sin there be some person for whom a life of celibacy be a spritual gift and maybe even a victory against a to-them trouble sexual urge that seem to them to lead only to sin nothing i say should ever be read a demean such a gift nor the even rarer gift of love for all my conspecific and indeed for all god creation that can develop to the full without the tutor of a marriage found in sex but there be a difference between spiritual gift and penance tell person that they have to have a particular gift or else what be fraught with manipulation and disregard of the difference of my spiritual endowment from god to one person be give the gift of speak in toungue to another intepretation of toungue to yet another prophecy and to still another teach the notion that some particular gift be require of all be one of the earliest heresy michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you nevertheles or you shall die like man and fall ml like any prince psalm
