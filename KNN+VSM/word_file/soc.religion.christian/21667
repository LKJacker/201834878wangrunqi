from cox sherman cox subject re hate the sin scott scott holt write hate the sin but love the sinner i hear that quite a bite recently often in the context of discussion about christianity and homosexuality but the context really be that important my question be whether that statement be consistent with christianity i would think not hate beget more hate never love consider some sin i leave it unnamed since i do want thi to digres into an argument a to whether or not something be a sin now let apply my hate the sin philosophy and see what happen if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the stronger my hatred of it will become eventually thi hate become so strong that we become disgust with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner in addition my hatred of the sin often cause u to say and that be an assumption on ymy part where be ymy proof that one alway will degenerate into hat the sinner because he hate the sin i be remind of the civil right movement in america it be true that many individual hat the proponent of racism it be also true that many individual hat segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and never degenerate into hat the individual who practice it dr king message wa thi love the individual the love of the individual would transform him into a friend however thi do not take away hi hatred for segregation hi hatred for injustice in the summary of the law christ command u to love god and to love my neighbor he do say anything about hate in fact if anything he command u to save my criticism for ourself so how be christian suppose to deal with the sin of other i suppose that there be only one way to deal with sin either in other or ourself through prayer we need to ask god to help u with my own sin and to help those we love with their only love can conquer sin hatred ha no place the best way to love someone be to pray for them i would ask did john the baptist practice love when he criticize the jewish leader of hi day did jesu practice love when he throw the moneychanger out of the temple we must have at least a distase for sin we must in order to fight it in ourself also we must be ready for the call from god to call sin by it right name jesu love everyone but he call sin by it right name it be true that love for other be to guide every step of my walk but it be also true that sometime the love for god call u to stand up for truth competition be the law of the jungle cooperation be the law of civilization eldridge cleaver sherman cox ius scox
