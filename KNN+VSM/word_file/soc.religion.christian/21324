from sml steve lang subject re the arrogance of christian in article you write the geniu of science be that it discover that enormou progress in knowledge could be make by isolate the study of physical interaction for the more general area of study and proceed not by logical argument but by experiment the scientific method be hypothesize attempt to disprove the hypothesi if you fail publish if other fail to disprove ymy hypothesi accept it a a work theory and move on thi method be suitable only for the study of object without will object which do not take an interest in the experiment science do not progress vium experimentation but by philosophise one aim of experiment be to investigate the validity of the hypthesis result from the model produce by thi think proces the arrogance of science be the assumption many advocate of science make that the scientific method be the only method of seriou study the only one lead to knowledge rather than belief science ha one advantage of all other approach to explain the world it be objective it further arrogance be the assumption which arise that since science be the only valid method of think everything which exist must be the sort of thing which the scientific method can study and that if the scientific method can not study it it either do not exist or can not in any way be know anything which affect the physical world can be study for example since we be part of the physical world anything include spirit which affect my behavimy can be observe science do not make any claim about the existence or non-existence of object which do not affect the physical world since these asumption about the nature of the world can not themself be make the subject of experiment it be bad science to believe them a well a arrogance illogic and just plain sloppy think the purpose of science be to produce a model of the physical world the model must be able to explain all past observation and predict the outcome of future observation one of the aim of experiment be to carry out well define observation which be objective ideally scientist will except the model which best describe the world and the model which realise on the minimal number of assumption at the moment model which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual world exist be equally powerful to one which assume the assumption of a spiritual world a the non-spiritual model ha fewer assumption it should be the currently accept model the scientific proces never assume that it present model be the correct one wherea many religion claim to represent the truth the arrogance of many theist be that they claim to represent the truth thi can not be say of scientist steve lang slang sling slink slick slack shack shank thank think thick
