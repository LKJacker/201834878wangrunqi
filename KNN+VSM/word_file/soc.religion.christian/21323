from gerry palo subject re athiest and hell in article rexlex write in article gerry palo write note that in thi perhap the oldest of the creed there be no mention of the danger of hell for non-believer likewise there be no mention of the salvation of the believer soul and it destiny in heaven after death there be only the resurrection of the body and it do not say when or how you do go far enough back if we believe in god and that he do create the heaven and the earth and he do create adam and eve and that they walk in the garden and history flow from there if we can agree with that then would you agree that the further back you go the closer you get to person who have a stronger memory of who god wa and what he say and command between adam and eve and golgotha the whole proces of the fall of man occur thi involve a gradual dim of consciousnes of the spiritual world thi be discernable in the world outlook of different people through history the greek for example could say better a beggar in the land of the live than a king in the land of the dead iliad i think the question of what happen to human be who die before christ be an ever present one with christian i be not ready to conscign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation yet they all die in their sin in the christian sense the same can be say of the whole of gentile humanity and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cro next to him i do not limit the power of christ to save even him through whom satan would mock hi deed of salvation at the very moment of it fulfillment in my study of the ancient mystery reliegion i have run acros many poem or ritual or what not with the interpretation that those who be of god will be with him vium the promise seed but those who rebel will suffer eternal life in die it wa a standard belief back then it be possible to experience eternity in a pass moment the relationship of eternity to duration be not simply one of indefinitely extend condition of greenwich mean time it be possible to imagine an eternity of agony or blis or even many of them in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth it wa also a standard belief among many people that even the righteou be lose thi again be the result of the los of the paradisal consciousnes that flee from u after the fall with my ever increase involvement with the sense world it would be interest to share in the result of ymy study of ancient person idea of life after death today we think we know so much and that if we could go back in time we could sure teach those person a thing or two but i think that a thi age ha grow older that it be we who opperate from a mist not those of the older age mankind fell into mist and darknes and at the turn point of time a new light enter into the world the light still grow and we be develop the eye with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under stand ly before u my new vision and understand be still very feeble but it contain something new that will grow in time to embrace that which be old and much more a well at thi point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insight that have lead me to my view on thi subject i have say it before i love to post on thi but the vulcan hammer would fall the history to purgatory can be show from the druid in england to the greek who pilaged it from the egyptian who ultimately get it from the babylonian mystery and ye the eastern religion also show many similarity i mean it black and white the write and the archeological find plainly show it origin and the why and wherefore of thi doctine the way you refer to it a doctrine put a modern intellectual color on it i think it wa much le abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete a teach that strike much closer to home than my doctrine or teach today can be receive i be not so ready to attribute widespread notion in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they be pass on the question be to what extent do they reflect real perception and experience the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different person idea of the time immediately after death testify to the presence of an underlie reality in any case we study geometry not by read old manuscript of euclid but by contemplate the principle themself on the other hand there be one notion firmly embed in christianity that originate most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human be consist essentially of soul only and that the soul be create at birth wa consciously adopt from aristotle whose idea dominate christian think for fifteen hundred year and still do today he wa at once the father of modern think and at the same time live during that darken time when the perception of my eternal spiritual be have grow dim maybe at sometime in the future indeed i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation be a real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment after the end of a single earthly life be not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and i think that be why the early creed be couch in term that do not try to spell it out rex gerry
