from rick granberry subject boston c of c note the follow article be submit on behalf of someone frank daniel who ha difficulty post to email reply to daniel i be unable to post to the bitnet group here be a capsule history of the movement in the church of christ i could trace the movement back a far a and indeed some of it root go back that far but these be really influence on the movement and not the actual movement per se i will start in in that day there be church and church in nearly every area due to segregation modern pentecostalism wa develop a a predominantly phenomenon here there wa great fanaticism emphasi on emotional experience and belief in a personal guidance and indwell of the holy spirit many protestant church be grow into what become know a conservative fundamentalism by the the evangelical movement wa in full swing and many group be become part of it when the civil right movement grow stronger in the and many church group begin to be influence by the church and by what wa go on there thi spread start in the most liberal of group and spread to the more conservative one by the late in even the catholic church wa display evidence of influence by the other group still evident today the church of christ be and be a very conservative protestant group when the influence from outside begin to reach the cofc in it wa generally not appreciate conservative group be very strongly resistant to change and the new movement wa very different from the cofc statu quo the magazine put out at that time by cofc folk tell the story a it unfold new idea come into the cofc there wa a big push to reach out to college student young adult and teen some call thi the campu evangel ism movement emotion generally not highly regard in the cofc at large play a more important role in the new movement in some place person begin to speak in tongue a their pentecostal predecessor do thi wa meet with extreme criticism from within the church of christ in some place person be fire from their job for speak in tongue or for advocate the holy spirit movement another name for the new branch the term underground church of christ also come into use because these person have to hide their difference or they might be ostricised there be several congregation however whose leadership be receptive to the new idea at least in part the tongues-speaking never really catch on one of these wa the street church of christ in gainesville fl campu ministry have already be regard a important at street and the new idea seem to be very helpful tool for evangelism they also seem to put vitality into the church which many felt have be lack in october of the street congregation hire chuck luca to be it campu minister by he would move to be the congregation lead minister in the late the congregation work with many other group they hold bible discussion at daytona beach during spring break they organize talk in the fraternity on the university of florida campu they also work with uf sport person in the congregation order a larger build to be construct when it wa finish the group move and change it name now no longer appropriate it become the crossroad church of christ from then on a name that would become legendary by thi time crossroad wa basically the only cofc whose program be fully align to the new movement while they do start it they continue it and be responsible for where it wind up go by none of the other church of christ in the area felt that they could cooperate with crossroad due to what they recognize a doctrinal problem at crossroad crossroad have begin to heavily emphasize and later require attendance at all church function it wa see a a good thing for each member to have at least one close relationship a person with whom you would share all of ymy problem pray and get help from the concept wa call prayer partner which later become discipleship partner and also later become mandatory the leadership wa assign prayer partner to person for a while the book call the master plan of evangelism wa a strong influence on chuck luca he and the group believe that it wa every person duty and life purpose to carry out the great commission crossroad wa grow in number and number become very important some would say all-important a person who wa evangelistic wa spiritual evangelism mean invite person to crossroad event if you do thi a lot and some of them convert then you be spiritual there be sermon about how if you buy grocery the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitation to service everyone at ymy job ought to receive invitation since these person need jesu you should be aggressive do take for an answer if you do not evangelize enough you come to be call lazy or unspiritual by the end of the decade the prayer partner system wa integrate into a structure the elder and minister be on top like a big pyramid then the group leader bible study leader and member everyone who come in have someone place over them it be at thi time that the bad pres about crossroad begin to circulate the problem with rape on the university of florida campu wa tremendou but crossroad wa consider a bigger and more immediate problem there be many complaint about the congregation and it pushy evangelistic tactic crossroad wa consider the other church of christ to be dead church which aggravate them it wa aggressively recruit out of the other church group denomination which aggravate them by thi time crossroad have grow numerically to the point where not only do they believe that they would soon need a new build but also they be send out plant create a new church and reconstruct reorganize an exist church team to other city by thi time the crossroad movement wa underway a group wa send to the lexington church of christ in boston ma the team wa head up by kip mckean who have be convert out of a fraternity by crossroad in gainesville kip hold a still stronger view of church authority which he believe wa heavily vest in the evangelist s and not so much in the elder he have be fire in from the congregation that he have be work at when the elder there find numerou thing wrong with hi theology include the practice of what come to be call one-over one christianity called thi by critic in the first year half of the person felt that they do not want to be a part of the new congregation they leave but other begin come into the new boston church of christ ah but i ahead of myself at crossroad the heavy-handed system have begin to take it toll on the member many have say that they felt that they be work hard but they be not achieve the result that be so important the number be drop from crossroad membership decline steadily the leadership begin to tighten the reign on the congregation who wa see a be largely unproductive and unfruitful the fruit passage in the nt be interpret a refer to new convert if you be not bear fruit say john you would be cast into the fire boston still teach thi if you love ymy neighbor you save hi soul invite him to church and convert him if you not do that you do love ymy neighbor and if you do love you in danger of backslide the logical argument continue in thi vein in chuck luca wa fire from hi job a minister due to recur sin in hi life these struggle be never reveal to the congregation at large although many person outside the congregation have hear about them for by now there wa very little contact on a friendship level between most crossroad member and those outside if you have contact ymy focu should be on convert them bring them to a bible study chuck replacement wa joe wood who wa fully supportive of the boston system a boston grow in number they begin to offer session for other minister joe go to boston to be train and return to cros road ready to emphasize the total commitment to the church that boston and kip mckean be now emphasize eventually in fall of the elder at crossroad now in number dick whitehead and bill hogle make a decision boston wa demand that all of the other church in the movement come under the direction of the church in boston the elder refuse cite their belief that each church should be autonomou something true in all non-boston church of christ perhap there wa also some degree of offense do here since crossroad wa no longer the to the rest of the movement the group now number about while boston wa now larger in membership the church of christ generally teach that baptism be a necessary element of salvation at crossroad they teach what wa call baptism you have to understand the commitment involve before you could be baptize you have to the cost at boston they take thi a step further if at some time you become unproductive then ymy spirituality wa suspect person would begin to ask you if you really understand what you be get into anyone who say have their baptism deem invalid they have count the cost properly they still have to be baptize other call thi rebaptism and crossroad do approve of thi practice when crossroad announce that it would not follow boston many of it member leave crossroad and go to movement-related ministry which be now call discipling ministry you be either discipling evangelize or you be dead they also use the nickname movement of god for a while by summer of crossroad wa withdraw from the movement and now stand alone they have few to no ally in the mainstream church of christ and now none in the movement boston however continue to chart it course in the direction that they have be follow they send reconstruction team to many city which usually mean that they split the church there they stop acknowledge other church of christ a christian and begin to call themself the remnant the remnant of the jew in the ot be those who be save by god it wa felt that the remnant today represent all the christian sometime they would simply call their movement the church they usually take the name of the city for their name imply to the other church of christ that boston do not recognize their existence many campuse have now formally forbid boston ministry from recruit there due to the number of complaint in some case it ha be document that boston ministry have lie to university official in order to continue to have acces to the campu any resistance that they experience be term perse cution which all true christian be expect to experience are you really a christian if you not be persecute the number at boston peak at in since then they have fight to remain steady i have hear a tape of kip mckean shout at the leader for fail to fulfill the great commission their life purpose a god command them their christianity be highly center on command and obedience crossroad once wa call a cult boston be now recognize by the cult awarenes network and other national and international group a a cult under a formal definition because of the technique which they employ the term cult be usually differentiate from sect by the practice of those technique the technique which they employ be recognize by many a be technique of destructive pursuasion also use by other shepherding discipleship group robert jay lifton margaret thaler singer and many other have write about the topic these technique include guilt motivation emotional manipulation load language the aura of sacred science a sort of mystic element see in everyday event and other i have no particular axe to grind against the movement i have numer ou friend who be still part of the movement i have never have a out with anyone in the movement i disagree with many thing which they teach i recognize the psychological damage do by be involve in such a system i hold no loyalty to the mainstream church of christ and do not defend their mistake either i want to point out though that unlike in many other system which be in other way similar the leadership of the boston movement be a much victim of the system a the member we do not have a leader who enjoy manipulate hi person the leader believe what they teach and they feel accountable for the activite and spiritual welfare of the member when member do not evangelize to their expectation for example the leader feel personally responsible a well the leader be not out for money or power they want to evangelize the world in their lifetime i have say too much but there be much more to say there be many example i could give and quote from other source include boston bulletin that i could include but thi be too long already you may post thi if you so desire frank d answer not a fool accord to hi folly lest thou also be like unto him answer a fool accord to hi folly lest he be wise in hi own conceit proverb believe it or not question about the boston church of christ be among the most commonly ask in order to avoid have
