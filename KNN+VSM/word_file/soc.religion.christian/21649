from pduggan paul c duggan subject re hate the sin in article scott scott holt write hate beget more hate never love consider some sin i leave it unnamed since i do want thi to digres into an argument a to whether or not something be a sin now let apply my hate the sin philosophy and see what happen if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the stronger my hatred of it will become eventually thi hate become so strong that we become disgust with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner though you can certaily assert all thi i do see why it necessarily ha to be the case why ca hate just stay a it be and not beget more who say we have to get disgust and start hat the sinner i admit thi happen but i donlt think you can say it be alway necessaily so why can we not hate with a perfect hatred in the summary of the law christ command u to love god and to love my neighbor he do say anything about hate in fact if anything he command u to save my criticism for ourself so how be christian suppose to deal with the sin of other i suppose that there be only one way to deal with sin either in other or ourself through prayer we certainly we should love even my enemy amo say to hate the evil and love the good thi ca contradict christ teach i think we tie up both hate and love with an emotional attitude when it really should be consider more objectively surely i do fly into a rage at every sin i see but why can i not hate it paul duggan
