from wquinnan malcusco subject re when be two person marry in god eye in article rob write i think it wa lewi who say that in a wed it the principal that marry each other the church and the state be present merely a witness thi be not just lewi it a summary of standard catholic theology however thi do mean that the presence of those witness be optional except in odd situation like the standard desert island clh i originally write to the person who ask thi question personally but decide to post the information i have on the topic i speak to the pastor of my parish catholic recently by coincidence on thi subject hi explaination wa that while it be possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest it be important to have it recognize by the church a soon a it be possible because the church recoginize itself a a community of believer member of the church to some degree be to be hold accountable to each other to be le hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island there be many place in the world that do not have priest availible for marriage on a regular basi therefore couple get marry without the priest be present but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one come through the area i remember a religion teacher in high school say that the marriage ceremony be not for the benefit of the couple a much a it be for the benefit of the community thu marry couple have some responsibility to the community to stay marry a divorce set a bad example for the community also the couple ha vow to become one with one another the community should be able to rely on that couple to be a one while couple may marry without witness they may not get anulment without a priest present an anulment be simply an admission of the church that what they have declare a marriage wa not in fact a marriage at all for whatever reason so do start get marry in the back seat of a station wagon and give yourself anulment a half-hmy later i tend to agree with the response back there that say couple become marry a soon a they consumate their marriage but i would add that couple should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex whether or not they intend to be marry assume they be both will partner to the sexual act the couple must be prepare to raise any child they may have a a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parent sex is a commitment i believe in god eye but i digress god be with you malcusco
