from mserv mail server subject re cause trajan stephen mcintyre write norri write some stuff delete fortunately for the convenience of u believer there be a clas of question that can never be reduce away by natural science for example why do the universe exist at all must there be a why to thi i ask because of what you also assume about god namely that he just exist with no why to hi existence so the question be reverse why ca we assume the universe just exist a you assume god to just exist why must there be a why to the universe remainder of message delete pardon me for reply to only a portion of ymy message the reason we can say god just exist and ca say the universe just exist be because the universe be a natural realm and be subject to natural law in general and the law of cause and effect in particular that be we observe in nature that every cause ha an effect and every effect wa produce by a cause the existence of the natural realm a an effect itself can not be it own cause it must therefore have a supernatural cause god on the other hand be a supernatural be and be therefore not subject to such natural law a the law of cause and effect a a supernatural be god eternal existence do not imply a previou cause the way the existence of a physical natural cosmo do thu those who believe in the supernatural have a valid basi for accept the existence of uncaused phenomenon such a the eternal god wherea those who deny the existence of the supernatural be face with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very nature show that it be not sufficient to explain it own existence thi be of course an oversimplification of a complex topic but i just want to clarify some important difference between the supernatural god and the natural the universe since you seem to mistake them a be interchangeable mark
