from bill bill irwin subject re what wa the immaculate conception ragraca randy a graca write consequently thi verse indicate that she wa without sin also a wa observe at the very top of thi post mary have to be free from sin in order to be the mother of jesu who wa definitely without sin if the mother of jesu have to be without sin in order to give birth to god then why do mary mother have to be without sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for jesu for that matter why do mary grandmother have to be without sin either seem to me that with all the original sin flow through each person the need for the last one mary to have none put god in a box where we say that he could have incarnate himself through a normal human be my god be an all powerful god who can do whatever suit hi purpose thi include create a solar system and planet earth with the appearance of great age provide a path through the red sea for the child of israel that do not depend on the existence of a ridge of high grind and a wind blow at the right speed and direction and the birth of himself from a normal sinful person without be taint by her original sin i see far too much focu on the object of religion and not nearly enough on the personal relationship that be available to all believer with the author of my existence without the necessity of have thi relationship channel through conduit to god in the form of mary apostle and a pope note that the idea of mary be conceive without original sin the immaculate conception be distinct from the idea of mary not have sin during her lifetime which be a separate doctrine and i believe also hold by the catholic church if mary wa bear without original sin and do sin during her lifetime how be she any different from jesu thi mean the world ha have two perfect human one die to take away the sin of the world the other give birth to him i would certainly want to see some scriptural support for thi before i would start pray to anyone other than god everything i have ever read from the bible teach me that jesu wa and be the only sinles lamb of god not hi mother grandmother hope thi be useful to you very useful in help me understand some of the rc belief thank you bill irwin the westrheim group vancouver bc canada uunet twg bill voice ymy computer bill fax system partner
