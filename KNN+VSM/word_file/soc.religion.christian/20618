from dan johnson subject re accepting jeesu in ymy heart in article jayne jayne kulikauska write eric mola write firstly i be an atheist i be not post here a an immature flame start but rather to expres an opinion to my intend audience delete we be just animal we need sleep food and we reproduce and we die i do mean to defend eric mola i find it somewhat annoy when someone pop up on to tell u all about hi usually atheistic belief so i can certainly see how christian might be annoy but i like to point out a few thing i be glad that i be not an atheist it seem tragic that some person choose a meaningles existence no mean from god be not the same a no mean from my atheistic point of view if you want mean in ymy life you get to go and get some or make some no free gift of mean i never quite understand how any god can just give ymy life mean actually if he say you exist to do or be x that gife you a purpose if you care to accept it but be that the same thing but i digres how terrible to go on live only because one fear death more than life thi would truely be a miserably existance which i doubt eric endure life can be enjoyable so you can live it because you like it or purposefull so you can live it to get something do one should endeavmy to make it so if it be not otherwise it would be a you say terrible i feel so sorry for eric and yet any attempt to share my joy in life with him would be consider a further evidence of the infectiou nature of christianity probably true remeber he almost certainly see that particular joy a an illusion and do not want it so maybe it be so bad a a christian i be free to be a human person i think love choose and create a an atheist i be free to be a human person i think love choose and create i will live forever with god ah now here we begin to diverge i will not live forever with anyone i do think you will either but you be welcome to ymy opinion on the matter christ be not a kind of drug i tend to agree with you it my opinion that unlike drug religion be normal part of human society i think they have outlive their usefullnes but they be evidently quite ordinary normal thing that have prove lethal to humanity yet drug be a replacement for christ those who have an empty spot in the god-shaped hole in their heart must do something to ease the pain i have hear thi claim quite a few time do anybody here know who first come up with the god-shaped hole busines thi be why the most effective substance-abuse recovery program involve meet people spiritual need you might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim like thi thank you eric for ymy post it ha help me to appreciate how much god ha bless me i hope that you will someday have a more joy-filled and abundant life i do know eric but i do not think it be wise to assume he ha a le joy-filled and abundant life because he hold certain belief dan johnson and god say jeeze thi be dull and it wa dull genesi these opinion probably show what i know
