from quinn t mccord subject question from a newbie is life a course and do god grade on a curve i new here and only vaguely religiou but i want to know what some of you person think specifically be there an infinite number of heaven and a person go to the one that deserve or be it simply heaven or nothing hell also be we grade by those around u or ha there alway be some unchanging method is the person childhood take into account i sure these must sound like over-simplification to most of you but i figure that you the expert quinn eschatology be an area on which christian do not agree i suspect that because my primary source of information be prophet and visionary and their write tend to be highly symbolic however both jesu teach in the gospel and book such a the revelation to john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death on a number of occasion jesu do say thing that imply some sort of differentiation lk and a number of similar passage where jesu say thing like even xxx will be better off than you in the judgement also i cor talk about someone who get into heaven but by the skin of hi tooth a it be but these passage be not normally interpret a suggest separate heaven so much a differ level of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell and not all christian would even go a far a that the only christian group i know of that believe in multiple heaven be the mormon and they be very far from mainstream christianity far enough that many of my reader would not call them christian their idea in thi area involve specific mormon revelation in addition to the bible and holy tradition of a more generic christian sort note that many christian will cringe at the very think of associate grade with god the whole point of christ wa to free u from the result of a test that we could possibly pa if you like test analogy god grade on a very strict and unbend scale but he also cheat he replace my test paper with an exam that wa prepare by the teacher before actually do the grade because some person end up in heaven and other in hell it easy to see why you be incline to think of it a grade while there be difference among branch of christianity on detail i think we all agree that in one way or another god cheat i be personally very sceptical about anyone who claim to know exactly how far god cheat extend will he accept person who do explicitly acknowledge christ but somehow still follow him in their heart many christian believe that thi be possible at least in principle but certainly not all do jesu provide u with a clear description of how to be save but it not clear to me that he provide an exact description of how he go to place the divide line certainly he make it clear that we ca expect to know whether other individual be save or not clh
