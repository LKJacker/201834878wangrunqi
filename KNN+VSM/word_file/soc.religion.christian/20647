from atterlep cardinal ximenez subject re the arrogance of christian mhsu melinda hsu write i like to share my think on thi topic of arrogance of christian and look forward to any response in my encounter with christian i find myself dismay by their belief that their faith be total truth according to them their belief come from the bible and the bible be the word of god and god be truth thu they know the truth thi stance make it difficult to discus other faith with them and my own hesitation about christianity because they see no other way their way be the but i see their faith arise from a willful choice to believe a particular way that choice be part faith and part reason but it seem to me a choice i sort of mystify about how a christian might respond to thi i start with a parable a christian woman hire a carpenter to build her a birdhouse when he come over they begin talk about religion so you believe that you understand god he ask ye i do she reply then have him build you the birdhouse i do think that melinda be complain about the basi of christian belief however there be a tendency among christian to say i have all the answer because god give them to me thi be simply not the case i believe that the bible be inerrant however my human interpretation of the bible be necessarily in error because we be human and imperfect we have to remember that we all make mistake in faith and that because we be human we have an imperfect understand of the mind and will of god to claim a so many person do that the existence of the bible allow u to determine the answer to all question be to claim that we human can fully understand god will thi be hubri
