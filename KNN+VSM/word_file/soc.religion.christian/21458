from muirm maxwell c muir subject re why do person become atheist in article randal lee nichola mandock write in article muirm maxwell c muir write in all candor i would be happy to be prove wrong about believe in atheism problem be i will have to be prove wrong in mention some nonsense about psychology and atheism bob muir ask the follow question no smiley on the part about atheism i see do you realize that ymy statement say that i wa mention nonsense about atheism thi be hard for me to defend against if thi be the claim you be make a you have only include the last two sentence of my post and mention the first please addres the substance of my post rather than reject it out of hand but because of the sometime ambiguou nature of english i may be misinterpret ymy word here please clarify do you or do you not mean to call my statement about atheism nonsense if so care to back up that claim do i sound break to you i answer in the affirmative ok then start up the amatuer psycology again how be i break is it politically correct for christian to be the only besiege group permit the luxury of arrogance yawn excuse me i do recall any portion of my post in which i call christian arrogant quote me if i do i do remember call christianity silly and then follow that up with information that i wa nine year old when i think that i also say that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest and i would like to see some sort of proof of ymy god existence i define faith a belief in the absense of any proof btw also i subscribe to a i mention and we see fundy of all type there so in answer to ymy question no finally i hardly call christianity beseiged in thi country i seldom see christian ridicule for merely practise their religion or wear cross or have christian bumper sticker i do know for sure of course i only say i have see it happen what i have see happen be my homosexual friend be beat up or preach at by person who claim to be christ follower i know that thi sort of thing be practice by the majority of christian but it be a very vocal minority who be do it and i do see comperable victimization of christian now i have a question for bob why in the world would any self-respecting atheist want to subscribe to a christian news group the implication be that i be not self-respecting of course i not a student of psychology btw but i be a student of creative writing and linguistic so literary analysi be my forte also if the implication i see be improper please let me know i here because i not sequester in my own little atheist cubbyhole a you seem to think atheist should be did it occur to you that i think i know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life have you read my other post here or do you see atheist and decide it wa time to poke at someone who do deserve ymy respect aw geez i sorry i probably be get my back up a little too high here it just that the nonsense thing really annoy me i figure you should see my first reaction though since they be my true reaction to ymy question now the smooth feather version i seek all sort of knowledge that why i come to my university ye i be look at ymy religion well sortum i have no idea what kind of christian you be from the outside and hopefully with an objective view i be try to ask reason question here because i genuinely do know the answer to them but when i saw the question direct at atheist i figure i would answer after all you can speculate about atheist motive here all you want hence the amatuer psychology crack but without an atheist you ca be sure of even one atheist motive i hop person really want to know and i wa try to show that i actually check out several religion and i actually read all the pamphlet person have to offer and i actually think about these thing instead i still face with the implication that atheism be some kind of aberration and that only break person be atheist try it from the flip side i posit that atheism be the natural state and only break person be theist i offer a proof that so many person witnes from horrible life which pick up a soon a they discover their religion that religion be regional if person do follow the religion of their area there would be a more homogenou mix so many terrorist claim theistic motive and that theist tend to be so pushy and angry when challenge on why be religion so successful because there be so much suffer in the world which break person it an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it which be another reason i here to try to see the flip side of my think and also a a watchdog for logical fallacy i have a difficult enough time keep up with it and i think i know something about the subject the implication here be that atheist ca possibly know anything about christianity probably jump at shadow again but i think my reaction be somewhat justify after all the first post suggest that atheist be break hostile person thi post confirm that someone else believe it bob remind me of my roommate in order to disbelieve atheism he say he will need to be prove wrong about it well he get me there i be a strong atheist because i feel that lack of evidence especially about something like an omnipotent be imply lack of existence however i have meet the strong atheist yet who say that nothing could ever persuade him call me a seeker if you like i do weak atheism be be ignore here though some atheist simply say i do believe in any god rather than my position i believe that no god s exist for the weak atheist the be no atheism to disbelieve because they do actively believe in atheism if you think thi be confuse try figure out the difference between protestant and methodist from an atheist point of view thi be another fallacy many theist seem to have that everyone believe in something follow up by everyone ha faith in something gues what my atheism end the moment i show a proof of some god existence is that really too much to ask well i do even waste my time try well i gues you wo succeed in convert him or me why the supposition that you will fail to convince him amatuer psycology on is it because you yourself be unconvinced i tell him that he just have to take my word for it and i tell you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest note that i can only speak for myself if you find faith to be honest show me how i have be unable to reconcile it so far maybe that how i break i tell you that i have invisible fairy live in my garden and that you should just take my word for it if you accept that you be of a fundamentally different mind than i and i really would like to know how you think all i ask for be proof of the assertion god exist logical or physical proof only please then we discus the nature of god in response he tell me he will say an atheist prayer for me prayer uh oh we have to revoke hi atheist club card and beanie good luck bob and best regard good luck to you a
