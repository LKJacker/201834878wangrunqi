from seanna seanna watson subject re accepting jeesu in ymy heart in article write in article seanna seanna watson write deletium recovery program etc i do need you to show me that there be such a thing a a spiritual need to do that it may be necessary to show me that spirit soul whatnot exist god be not important to that a far a i can tell i get the feel that we be debate at cross-purpose that we do not see the same fundamental assumption and thi perhap make my answer orthogonal to ymy question i will try again perhap you believe that nothing exist aside from objectively observable and provable thing in that case i can not show you that there be such thing a a spirit or a spiritual need these thing do not exist in the realm of the objective but in the realm of the subjective otoh if you wish you can simply but explicitly please assume spirit exist and then show me that they would have need and that handle these need in some way you can assume god exist too if that will help i play along by i assume you mean alcoholic anonymou and not i would not say that aa handle spiritual need rather i would say that aa and other program help person come to term with their need ie that aa be facilitate the recovery and that a part of the recovery they recognize their spiritual need and begin to rely on a higher power term to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse they have be accustom to sorry there be no objective proof here either no way to take identical alcoholic and try to have one recover by fulfil spiritual need and one without and externally compare the difference we be talk about the virtually infinite complexity of person here but i should say if god be a necessary component of ymy spiritual need then i truely do not understand at all it sound to me like spirit have need that should be fulfil by god but can be mask in other way drug etc if thi be the case then you can leave out god just describe the problem not the solution spiritual need could be define a thing that person need in addition to physical requirement like air food sleep etc these be thing like the need for love and acceptance and the need for mean in life if one deny the existence of spiritual thing one would presumably call these emotional need the reason christian call them spiritual need be that they have aspect that be not fulfillable except by spiritual mean ie a person could be love and accept by many person and do many meaningful thing but still have a need for love which can only be satisfy by the love of god now the problem be that there be person who accept the existence of these need and person who reject them since i believe in absolute truth some of these person be right and the other be wrong so here be the possibility if christian be right then we all have spiritual need ie we all need god those who do not realize that they need god be delude they just have recognize it yet if christian be wrong spiritual need be an artefact of my brain chemical well-adjusted and properly-integrated personality do not have such thing christian be simply use the concept of god and spiritual need to mask their own inadequacy i hate to belabmy the point but the existence of spirit and spiritual need can not be objectively demonstrate or prove just like the existence of god can not and ye thi mean that there be a risk that all my subjective evidence be manufacture by my brain chemical but on the other hand i could venture into solipsism and say that there be a risk that everything that i appear to objectively know be really manufacture by my brain chemical i suspect thi be an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and demonstration of the existence of spirit and spiritual need but my assertion be that such thing be not objectively demonstrable a i have say before i myself be on the christian side of agnosticism have be push off the fence by subjective evidence and no i wa not raise a christian so it be not a case of simply accept what i wa indoctrinate with seanna watson bell-northern research pray that at the end of live seanna ottawa ontario canada of philosophy and creed god will find hi person busy opinion what opinion oh these opinion planting tree and sow seed no they not bnr they mine i know i leave them somewhere fred kaan
