from philip g sell subject hebrew grammar text choose english or german greeting probably a tire old horse but maybe with a slightly different twist i want to know if there be any good english-language text for learn ancient hebrew and how these compare with german educational text qualitywise if anybody ha an idea i ca figure out if i should buy one here for later study or wait until i get back to the something i find interest about study theology in germany be the fact that the student get their ancient language-learning out of the way early i not a theology student but i spend a lot of time with such folk in their career they take the first two year or so to just do greek and latin and hebrew possibly aramaic too who know what it like at divinity school or seminary in the state is there a lot of language instruction do i really do have a basi for comparison regard phil philip sell is anything too hard for the lord gen for better of worse we do have the tradition of classical education in the so generally if a seminary believe student should know greek they have to teach it it common for seminary to require at least a semester each of hebrew and greek though of course more be require for seriou scholarship clh
