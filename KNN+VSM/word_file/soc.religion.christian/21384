from bfinnert brian finnerty subject mary assumption a few point about mary be take into heaven at the end of her life on earth one piece of evidence for mary assumption into heaven be the fact that no christian church ever claim to be the sight where she wa bury some christian church claim to be locate at the final rest place of peter mark and other saint but no one ever claim to posse the body of mary the greatest of the saint why because everyone know that she have be take up into heaven although there be no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of mary some passage seem suggestive like the passage in revelation that describe a woman give birth to a son and later be crown in the heaven of course the woman in thi passage ha other interpretation she can also be take a symbol for the church the assumption of mary make sense because of her relationship to christ jesu perfect god and perfect man fulfil the requirement of the law perfectly under the law god give to u we be to honor my mother and father and christ act of take hi mother into heaven be part of hi fulfillment of that law also he take hi flesh from her so it seem appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave one last point an ex-catholic attempt to explain catholic doctrine on the assumption by assert it be connect to a belief that mary do not die thi be not a correct summary of what catholic believe the dogma of the assumption wa carefully phrase to avoid say whether mary do or do not die in fact the consensu among catholic theologian seem to be that mary in fact do die thi would make sense christ die and hi mother who wait at the foot of the cro would want to share in hi death brian finnerty
