from psb jr phillip s buckland subject re accepting jeesu in ymy heart disclaimer throughout thi post there be statement and question which could easily be interpret a be sarcastic they be not i have write thi reply in the most even-handed manner that i can with no emotion boil to the surface a it wa write please accept thi a a seriou attempt to foster dialog and rest assurred that i make every attempt to make fun of no one except myself eric mola write firstly i be an atheist i be not post here a an immature flame start but rather to expres an opinion to my intend audience the human be be an animal who ha due to advance mental facility develop religiou a a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable hmmm there be other animal on thi planet with advance mental facility which have not develop religion a a satisfactory explaination for the unexplained why be thi so further it appear that only human have a need to explain the unexplained why be thi so the other animal on thi planet include those with advance mental facility seem perfectly content in their ignorance i like to point out that ymy presupposition scream out at me from ymy unsupported statement they be human be animal only religion exist a a crutch so that the unexplained need not be research religion wa make up by human to addres a perceive need the biological aspect of human be deify that be all aspect of human life can be categorize in a hierarchical structure with biology at the apex needles to say i disagree with ymy strong opinion and the underlie presupposition christianity be an infectiou cult the reason it flourish be because it gife person without hope or drive purpose in life a safety blank to hide behind oh i have to do be follow thi christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness for all of you find jeezu how many of you be on the brink i disagree that christianity be an infectiou cult it ha certainly show itself to be persistent a a belief system in spite of variou persecution throughout the past two millenium that it continue to persevere do not demonstrate that it be infectiou in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provide a workable system for it adherent and i would argue that thi be the case i disagree that christianity be a safety blanket which supplant hope and purpose rather it point an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there be nothing hide about a christian source for hope and purpose of what usefulnes to you be the distinction between internally motivate hope and purpose and externally give hope and purpose is the apparent los of control over one own life the problem or be it something else finally one do not appropriate eternal happiness by follow christian moral standard indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity be because standard be inadequate to save person from their imperfection moral standard be merely guide to the christian the real power to moral live be give to the christian in the person of god spirit heaven be one of two final state that christian doctrine postulate however christian be generally not motivate to live accord to christian moral standard by thi promise future reward rather they be motivate by the perceive benefit to them in the here-and-now but i digres the other reason christianity flourish be it infectiou nature a best friend of mine breifly enter a christian group and within month they set ministry guideline for him which basicaly say thi priority spread the word many christian organization be concern with evangelism a a priority and rightly so for it wa jesu himself who give thi a a priority for hi follower however it be not the penultimate priority a evangelism be normally understand preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism be generally best do through respect the opinion of other while demonstrate the very real benefit of a christian lifestyle thi demonstration should be so powerful that it compel the non-christian to seek out the christian to ask why needles to say such a demonstration be not easily accom plished it take a radical committment to the person of jesu it do not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian be require and it can not occur where no personal bond of friendship exist it be ineffective with stranger who can not evaluate the demonstration over time and it be easy to alienate or harm other if the sole purpose of be a friend be to gain a conversion a a long-time christian nearly year i view with some skep ticism all evangelism program which incorporate a hurry-up attitude pressured conversion may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all because the pressure convert realize wa coerce and disavow christianity when they would have be open to it in the future have they not be take advantage of now the bible state that it be the very spirit of god which bring conviction of wrong-doing to person i be content to do my part witnes and let the spirit do the rest we be just animal we need sleep food and we reproduce and we die we be far more than animal we sleep eat reproduce and die just a other animal do true but we be also capable of more than thi if ymy personal vision of humanity or of yourself be so limit i can only hope and pray that you will someday find a more expansive view for reflection what animal have the wide variety of perform art that human do how be it that human can learn the language of other human or animal but that other animal can not do so how be it that human can organize themself in variou social structure wherea other animal have only one structure religion especially christianity be nothing more than a drug blatant assertion christianity be not physically addictive christianity be not psychologically addictive christianity be not a thing which one it be a relationship with a live be you might a validly characterize any close knit relationship with thi appelation some person use drug a an escape from reality christian inject themself with jeezu and live with that high there be jesu freak who let the emotional aspect of worship and christian live gain and retain the upper hand even so thi do not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these thing flow it pity me how many million of life have be lose in religiou war of which christianity ha have no small part guilty by association that christianity which force itself upon another be not christianity at all when christian see a non-believer they say that person be blind to the truth but they can not realize that it be they who live with thi mask of fakenes each day jesu wa just prophet who happen to have a large influence because at that time the roman be circa disperse the jewish population and community need some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need you appear to have an amaze certainty about what really happen year ago how do you come by it i can not accept ymy conclusion that jesu influence wa a sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in he wa year go by thi time it strain the bind of credulity to assert that nothing about jesu life wa noteworthy until the sack i must go these be but a few of my think on christianity christianity be have a relationship with jesu christ himself what do you know of him we read the world wrong phil buckland and say that it deceife u psb tagore from stray bird psb
