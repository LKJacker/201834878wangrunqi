from mussack christopher mussack subject re christian need for christianity in article lmh henling lawrence m write in article mussack write for example why do the universe exist at all whether there be a why or not we have to find it thi be pascal wager if there be no why and we spend my life search then we have merely waste my life which be meaningles anyway if there be a why and we i find thi view of christianity to be quite dishearten and sad the idea that life only ha mean or importance if there be a creator do not seem like much of a basi for belief please forgive all the inclusion i suppose they be neccessary to follow the argument my point be that if life ha mean or importance then we should try to find that mean or importance which be almost a tautology i hope i not be too patronize one term for that mean be creator though that be not obviou from my above argument and the logic be also appal god must exist because i want him to it more like i think therefore i be therefore god be i have hear thi line of reason before and wonder how prevalent it be certainly in modern society many person be convince life be hopeles or so the pollster and newscast state but i do see where thi be a good reason to become religiou if you want why not just join a cult such a in waco the leader will give you the security blanket you desire unfortunately the term religiou be ambiguou to me in thi context i could say that search for mean in life be by definition be religiou i could say cult follower by definition have give up on the search if you want mean why not search for the truth so far my understand of christianity be congruent with my understand of truth there have be many before me who have come to conclusion that be word in way that make sense to me by no mean do that imply that i understand everything chri mussack
