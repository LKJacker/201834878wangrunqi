from parkin michael parkin subject re being right about messiah in article desiree bradley write i must have miss the post about waco david koresh and the second coming how do one tell if a second coming be the real thing unles the person claim to be it be obviously insane first by hi fruit the messiah come to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth he also come to first reveal the root cause of original sin fall nature and then provide a mean to cut the connection to that original sin he also want to create world peace base on godism the messiah teach will build on the foundation of the bible but provide profound new insight into the nature of god the fall of man the purpose of creation and god providence of restoration it will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the world religion many christian expect jesu to come on literal cloud so they may mi him when he return just a the jewish person miss jesu year ago they be still wait for hi first come the jewish person of that age expect elijah to come first jesu say that john the baptist wa elijah but john the baptist deny that he wa elijah how do thi reflect on jesu later in prison john even question who jesu wa be he the one who be to come or do we look for another see book of matthew i not say that david koresh be the second coming of christ how could somebody who break hi word be the second coming koresh do promise that he would come out of hi compound if only he wa allow to give a radio broadcast he do still it seem to me that he do fool some person david koresh do even come close the problem be that person like thi make it difficult for person to believe and trust in the real messiah when he do show up and from my meagre knowledge of the bible it seem that christian have be hard on the jew of christ day for be cautiou about accept somebody that their religiou authority do accept a the messiah so i wa surprise that nobody have discuss the difficulty of want to be early to recognize the second coming while at the same time not want to be credulously believe just anybody who claim to be god very good point and perhap the most important point of all for christian how to recognize the second coming the messiah should not claim to be god what set a messiah apart be that he be bear without original sin he be not bear perfect but achieve perfection after a period of growth adam and eve be bear sinles but they fell and thi tragedy mean that it would take god thousand of year to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth a god originally intend god restoration providence be still not complete the messiah be the true son of god one with god god representative on the earth but not god himself there be only one god mark and then if any one say to you here be the christ or there he be do not believe it mark and then they will see the son of man come in cloud with great power and glory my understand of jesu answer be that unlike hi first come which wa veil the second come will be quite unmistakeable by the way from koresh public statement it not so clear to me that he be claim to be christ who else in thi world be claim to be the messiah maybe he already here mike
