from ml michael siemon subject re homosexual issue in christianity in article mserv someone name mark write ml michael siemon write homosexual christian have indeed check out these verse some of them be use against u only through incredibly perverse interpretation other simply do not addres the issue i can see that some of the above verse do not clearly addres the issue there be exactly zero verse that clearly addres the issue however a couple of them seem a though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretation in order to be see a condemn homosexuality the kind of interpretation i see a incredibly perverse be that apply to the story of sodom a if it be a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christian cite the bible in such a context should be presume to have at least read the story it amount to slander a charge that homosexuality rape to use that against u do not be deceive neither fornicator nor idolator nor adulterer nor effeminate nor homosexual nor thieve nor the covetou nor drunkard nor reviler nor swindler shall inherit the kingdom of god and such be some of you i cor the moderator adequately discus the circularity of ymy use of porneium in thi i think we can all agree with paul that there be some kind of activity that could be name by fornication or theft or covet or revile or drunkennes which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bind of those category however and the very fact that they be argue over suggest that not only be the matter not at all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician have no interest in making them clear leave matter rather to my spirit-led decision with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that ha dominate christian discussion of all these area homosexual behavior be no different i and the other gay christian i know be adamant in condemn rape heterosexual or homosexual and child molestation heterosexual or homosexual and even the possibly harmles but obsessive kind of sex heterosexual or homosexual that would stand condemn by paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite may i mildly suggest that what paul do in hi letter that you want to use be perhap a good guide to hi mean be free to do anything you say ye but not everything be for my good no doubt i be free to do anything but i for one will not let anything make free with me cor which be a restatement that we must have no other god before god a commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wish to break some person be indeed involve in obsessively drive mode of sexual behavior it be just a wrong though slightly le incendiary so it a secondary argument from the contingent to equate homosexuality with such behavior a to equate it with the rape of god messenger i wo deal with the exegesi of leviticu except very tangentially fundamentally you be exhibit the same circularity here a in ymy assumption that you know what porneium mean there be plenty of law prohibit sexual behavior to be find in leviticu most of which christian ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just assume that they know which one be moral and which one be ritual well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean v unlcean a category in an awful lot of society we have them too but bury pretty deep and i can not see any grind for distinguish these bite of leviticu from the ritual law which no christian i know feel apply to u i dead seriou here when person start go on a they do in thi matter about how repulsive and unnatural my act be and what do they know about it huh it be a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcation a the american prejudice against eat insect on what basi other than assume ymy conclusion can you say that the law against male-male intercourse in leviticu be not a part of the ritual law for those christian who do think that some part of leviticu can be law for christian while other be not even to be think about it be incumbent on you in every case handle on it own merit to determine why you pick one and ignore another i frankly think the whole effort misguide reread paul no doubt i be free to do anything but christian have a criterion to use for make my judgment on thi the great commandment of love for god and neighbor if you can not go through leviticu and decide each command there on that basi then ymy own arbitrary selection from it be simply idiosyncracy in thi context it be remarkably offensive to say i notice that the verse forbid bestiality immediately follow the verse prohibit what appear to be homosexual intercourse well la-ti-da so what thi be almost a slimey an argument a the one that homosexuality rape i know of no one who argue seriously though one can alway find joker in defense of bestiality it be absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issue gay christian do raise which concern sexual activity within commit consensual human adult realtionship so that ymy bring it up be no more relevant than the law of kashrut if you can not addres the actual issue you be be bloody dishonest in trail thi red herring in front of the world if you want to addres bestiality that be ymy busines not mine and attempt to torpedo a seriou issue by use what be in my culture a ridiculou joke show that you have no interest in hear u a human be you want to dismis u and use the sleaziest mean you can think of to do so jesu and paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length the central linch-pin of christian moral think we be require to love one another and all else depend on that gay and lesbian christ ian challenge you to addres the issue on those term and all we get in return be cheap debate trick attempt to side-track the issue christian no doubt very sincere one keep show up here and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they ever do be spout these same old verse which they obviously have never think about maybe never even read in total ignorance of the issue raise slander u with the vilest charge of child abuse or whatever their perfervid mind can manage to conjure up toss out red herring with they suppose great emotional force to cause reader to dismis my witnes without even take the trouble to find out what it be such behavior should shame anyone who claim to have see truth in christ why for god preciou sake do you person quote irrelevant verse to condemn person you do know and wo even take the trouble to listen to before you start ymy condemnation is that love ymy neighbor god forbid is that how you obey the repeat command to not judge or condemn other christ and paul spend order of magnitude more time in insist on thi than the half-dozen obscure word in paul that you be so bloody ready to take a license to do what god tell you not to do why for god sake for god do not send the son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might be save through him whoever believe in him be not condemn but whoever do not believe ha already be condemn for refuse to believe in the name of god only son now the judgment be thi the light ha come into the world but man have prefer darknes to light because their deed be evil for everyone who practice wickednes hate the light and do not come near the light for fear hi deed will be expose but he who act in truth come into the light so that it may be that hi deed be do in god john for long age we many of u have be confuse by evil counsel from evil man and tell that if we come to the light we would be sham and reject some of u despair and take to course that probably do show a sinful shun of god light blessed be those whose spirit have be crush by the self-righteou they shall be justify however we have see the truth and the truth be the light of humanity and we now know that it be not we who fear the light but my enemy who fear the light of my witnes and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darknes of false witnes against u michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you nevertheles or you shall die like man and fall ml like any prince psalm
