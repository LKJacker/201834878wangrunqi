from aaronc aaron bryce cardena subject re ethnicity in worship jerryl payne write to sublimate a culture for the sake of what you perceive a unity seem antithetical to the very message of inclusion that you preach i agree with the exception that i do preach ignore my culture the body a a whole must be unify the question be shall we be a melt pot boil ourself down to one legitimate expression or shall we be more like a stew maintain the textural integrity of the express diversity while uphold the unity of think it release all church from the use of the latin mas unity to allow them to speak to the person in the common language diversity in revelation we see that in the first century church there wa one congregation in each major city so there wa one unify church now in each city there be person of different culture naturally they form something of a stew with different member have different heritage nevertheles they be one body they meet together sometime a smaller group in their home and sometime in bigger group in place such a the temple court now in a particular city then and now you will find that there be a common language associate with that region for instance in rome latin wa speak in the united state today english be speak so it would make sense that congregation in different city would speak the common language and not necessarily latin naturally you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language in the first century church there be probably many person in the congregation who could speak a give tongue to translate the message for person of foreign ethnic group today however you do see person speak in tongue to translate sermon even in so-called pentacostal church we do have a modern day equivalent though bi-lingual speaker now in the unify church of which i be a member sometime call the international church of christ when we all meet together on sunday there be headphone on person who do speak english from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue neat idea huh now we meet in different size group in a random sort of way on sunday so sometime there will be a meet of only haitian or of spanish speak person for example who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language in addition we meet in small group a couple of time during the week for bible discussion group and devotional so someone who speak a different language will almost alway be with person who also speak hi language assume the congregation be large enough for those meet a for the person who speak the common language they can keep in touch with their culture if they want but they will also have equally deep friendship among their church relationship with person of many variou nationality ha the purpose of the church be thwart by thi action the action of let catholic worship in a native language instead of latin indeed not see my second paragraph in response to the second clip of ymy article however if you mean the action of form denomination base on a culture then the purpose of the church ha be indeed thwart i assume the second possiblility when answer ymy next clip rather i believe it ha be enhance for paul exhort u to become a one of them that we might reach them thu if a person or group of person feel more comfortable among their own shall we not give them a place where they can feel comfortable with their heritage and still l ove god my gues aaron you have meet some need of person certainly by help them to be proud of their cultural heritage when most denomination do yet you have largely isolate yourself from have quality christian friendship outside ymy nationality and ymy denomination we shall certainly give person a place to feel comfortable with their heritage however we will do thi in a way that do not destroy church unity but rather encourage friendship among all disciple thi be the approach of some of the group that you cite it sound like these group have wonderful intention but they be go about thing in the wrong way and name like the african methodist episcopal church still make me cringe although not a much a before i understand that there wa more racism in the past that cause such group to be form but now we should try to unite i know that it hard for many person on thi newsgroup to imagine there be only one body of person on earth but it be quite possible and i be work to make it happen however what might be a smaller step toward unity would be take the word african out of ymy denomination name then perhap someday a long time off you can also remove the methodist episcopal part also and simply be part of the church with regard to inclusivity i note tht ymy sig emit from mit a you know the be religiously and culturally diversify and not everyone who come there be immediately comfortable with english much le american culture what shall be the conduct of the campu church then shall there be one church for the sake of unity or shall the organization like kcf be useful in help student new to america make the transition in culture language and think there shall be one church for the sake of unity and it shall be useful in help student new to america make the transition in culture language and think we should make a new denomination to try to solve problem the whole denominational mindset only cause more problem sadly in the ame church we retain african cutlure at the root of my expression but we be by no mean exclusive since you live in cambridge i invite you to visit the local assembly there thank you for the invitation that show me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of jesu a well a take part in ymy cultural heritage thank you also for respond to my post i know all too well how they can be very time-consuming the whole idea of celebrate ymy culture be pave with good intention but i still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same time my own church the boston church ha the acapella sing that you mention in ymy post yet do limit expression of my mexican culture even though i be in the mit campu ministry and not the spanish speak zone i have make a commitment to god that i will go to the sunday service of my church because i know that my brother and sister here be fully devote in love for god a hi disciple i do believe in tongue a you may have already pick up on because of my understand of biblical christianity however i be certainly will to visit ymy congregation provide that it do interfere with my normal worship since you also live in cambridge i also extend an invitation to you to visit my service a often a you like you can meet the mit student at the student center acros from mas ave at on sunday to leave for worship or simply call me after wednesday night to find out where the service will be hold on a particular day my number be but will be in a few week from now and for the rest of the summer my service normally last from to noon but occasionally be later or earlier time per year let u alway strive to reach all with the gospel by any mean necessary a we move from milk to meat the petty thing of the world that temporally separate u will dissolve away and we shall stand with my naked realization that god ha shed hi grace on all of u hi delightful creation definitely let also strive to grow in obedience to the lord through be man
