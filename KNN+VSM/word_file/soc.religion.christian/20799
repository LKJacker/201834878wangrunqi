from dan johnson subject re the arrogance of christian in article boundary write dleonar pixie write deletium sig if you do sincerely believe that a god exist why do you follow it blindly do the word question authority mean anything to you i defy any theist to reply deletium formality i probably should let thi pa it not worth the time and it not really intend for me but i could resist a personal weaknes of mine jerkiu kneeu tragically incurable the foundation for faith in god be reason without which the existence of god could not be prove that hi existence can be prove by reason be indisputable cf my short treatise traditional proof for the existence of god and summa theologica not so i can prove that the existance of god be disputable by show that person dispute it thi be easy i dispute that god exist simple i miss ymy traditional proof treatise but the proof i remember from the summa theologic the way i think it wa be rather poor stuff the ontological argument be about a billion time better imho i would think you want non-traditional proof consider the general failure of the traditional proof at least the one i know of i be think of the ontological argument the cosmological argument and the teleological argument those be the one traditional enough to have funny name anyway now give that god exist and that hi existence can be prove by reason i assert that hi command must be follow blindly although in my fall condition we must alway have some measure of doubt about my faith why thi be the real question so to discus it i assume god exist otherwise there be no heavenly authority to babble about because god be the first cause of all thing the first mover of matter the independent thing that require nothing else for it existence the measure of all that be perfect and the essential being who gife order to the universe logo please show thi be the case i be familiar with the first cause argument and i accept for the sake of argument that there be a first cause even though i find some of it premice questionable the rest you have to show thi include that the first cause be god i next assert that god be all good got it i deny that god be all good so there if thi be so then that which be contrary to the will of god be evil the absence of the good and since god can never contradict himself then by hi promise of a savior a early a the protoevangelium of genesi god instruct that because a human adam wa first responsible for man alienation from the source of all good a man would be require to act to restore the friendship thu god become incarnate in the person of the messiah thi be self-consistent if human must renew the relationship then god incarnate or not ca do it well unles you think god be human granted god make himself but thi be nonetheles cheat the intent of the statement be clearly that man ha to fix the problem he cause god fix it even by indirect mean contradict thi now thi messiah claim that he be the truth john if thi claim be true then we be bind by reason to follow him who be truth incarnate why also why assume say claim be true anyway if i claim to be truth be you bind by reason to follow me you next seem to have a problem with authority have you try the united state marine corps yet i can tell you first-hand that it be an excellent instructor in authority undoubtably do you mean to imply we should all obey the command of the marine without question you seem to imply thi about god and that the marine be similar in thi respect if thi be not what you be try to say they please explain what it be you be say a i have miss it if you have not yet have the privilege i will reply that the authority which be truth incarnate may never be question and thu must be follow blindly why why not question it even if it be truth we can not know thi certainly so why be it so irrational to question perhap we will thu discover that we be wrong you assert that god be truth and we ca question truth but i assert that god be not truth and anyway we can question truth how be it my assertion be le good than your one may not deny the truth oh i hereby deny i hope you agree be the truth granted i look pretty damn silly say something like that but i need something we both agree wa clearly true now you notice no stormtrooper have march in to drag me off to the gulag no heaven light bolt either no mysteriou net outage i seem to be permit to say such thing absurd or not for example when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newton head he could have deny that it happen but he do not the law of physic must be obey whether a human like them or not they be true they be certainly not true at least the one newton derive be not true and be indeed wildly inaccurate at high speed or small distance we do not have a set of law of physic that alway work in all case if we do physic would be over already science be all about questioning thi sort of truth if we do we still follow aristotle i generalize thi a little more if you want to learn anything new you must question the thing you know tm because you can alway be wrong therefore the authority which be truth may not be deny even presuppose that truth may not be denied and may not be questioned and that god be truth it only follow that god may not be denied or questioned not that he must be obey we could unquestioningly disobey him how annoy of u but you have not connect denial with disobedience dan no nickname johnson and god say jeeze thi be dull and it wa dull genesi these opinion probably show what i know
