from poram subject re deuterocanonical esp sirach in article revdak d andrew kille write dave davi ddavi write lot delete with which i generally agree there be no inherently defensible argument for the inclusion or exclusion of the deuterocanonical book i think everyone would agree that principle that can not be consistently apply be not very useful a principle so if we be to exclude them not accord them the authority of scripture we would appear to require other reason what might these reason be let talk about principle if we accept that god set the standard for what ought to be include in scripture then we can ask is it authoritative is it prophetic is it authentic is it dynamic is it receive collect read and use on these count the apocrapha fall short of the glory of god to quote unger bible dictionary on the apocrapha they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracy and anachronism they teach doctrine which be false and foster practice which be at variance with sacred scripture they resort to literary type and display an artificiality of subject matter and style out of keep with sacred scripture they lack the distinctive element which give genuine scripture their divine character such a prophetic power and poetic and religiou feel my interim conclusion be that protestant exclusion of at least one of these write be one of those of man one hear of so often they be exclude during the reformation and that appear to be the reason many person continue to exclude them but the problem with thi argument ly in the assumption that the hebrew canon include the apocrapha in the first place and it wa until the sixteenth century that luther and co throw them out the jewish council you mention previously do accept them so the reformation protestant have good historical precedence for their action jerome only translate the apocrapha under protest and it wa literally hi dead body that it wa include in the catholic canon the simple fact be that protestant exclusion roman inclusion orthodox inclusion of still other book or any other definition of a close canon be the decision of a community of faith about what the standard collection of scripture shall be for that community they all be tradition of man whether one consider that to be a problem or not depend on which community happen to be your and how you accept define authority within it i personally believe that the concept of a close canon whether catholic protestant or orthodox be one that develop rather late in the history of the church and which ha not serve the church well how do you then view the word i warn everyone who hear the word of the prophecy of thi book if anyone add anything to them god will add to him the plague describe in thi book and if anyone take away from thi book the prophecy god will take away from him hi share in the tree of life and in the holy city rev surely thi set the standard and not just man-made tradition it be also noteworthy to consider jesu attitude he have no argument with the pharisee over any of the ot canon john and explain to hi follower on the road to emmau that in the law prophet and psalm which refer to him the ot division of scripture luke a well a in luke take genesi to chronicle the jewish order we would say genesi to malachi a scripture see dr lee macdonald the formation of the christian biblical canon abingdon for a clear and faithful examination of the origin and issue of the canon i be not familiar with the book some other argument you might like to consider be find in chapter of josh mcdowell evidence that demand a verdict barney resson many shall run to and fro knowledge shall increase daniel
