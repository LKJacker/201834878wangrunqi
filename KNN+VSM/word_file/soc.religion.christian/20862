from wagner david wagner subject re certainty and arrogance darren dr nancy sweetie kilroy write darren in an earlier article i explain that what many person find darren arrogant about christian be that some christian profes darren absolute certainty about their belief and doctrine and darren in short the problem be that no matter how good ymy source darren be if any part of ymy doctrine or belief rest on ymy own darren think and reason then those doctrine be suspect the point that darren raise be a very lutheran viewpoint while reason be a gift from god it be also infect by sin yet we do not reject reason entirely and neither i think do darren we need reason a darren himself ha point out to comprehend god revelation of himself in the bible but reason alone be not sufficient to comprehend and believe the word we need first and foremost faith for the sinful mind be hostile to god it do not submit to god law nor can it do so roman luther accept scripture a the sole mean of revelation sola scriptura but accept the necessity of the use of reason with faith in comprehend that revelation yet luther also say regard baptism but mad reason rush forth and because baptism be not dazzle like the work which we do regard it a worthles large catechism fourth part baptism to make matter more complicate luther wa the sort of theologian that many person would describe a an absolutist i see him describe a a take no prisoner theologian we might conclude give these observation that luther wa inconsistent or mad and surely at least some have come to that conclusion but it might be useful to recall that jesu wa also call mad and peter felt compel to defend himself and the apostle against a charge of drunkennes on pentecost so we a christian ought to be careful about reject luther or other a mad rather we should imitate the berean who examine the scripture every day to see if what paul say wa true act the basi for the confidence with which luther peter paul and many other preach the gospel wa not just reason but faith and the holy spirit thi be not faith divorce from reason but a faith that guide inform and use reason the spirit enable u to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly god do not want u to preach the message that i think that jesu might have rise from the dead but rather i know that my redeemer life job the christian do not side with pilate in say what be truth but rather follow christ who say in fact for thi reason i wa bear and for thi i come into the world to testify to the truth everyone on the side of truth listen to me john we can know the truth because god ha promise u that we can know the truth jesu say if you hold to my teach you be really my disciple then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free john the proverb urge u buy the truth and do not sell it pr the psalmist pray do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth ps evidently he believe that the word of truth wa in fact in hi mouth yet we do indeed appear arrogant if my claim to the truth be motivate by self-glorification but if we present the truth a the teach of scripture reveal by the spirit and not my own invention and if we stand ready to be prove wrong on the basi of scripture a luther do then we be not arrogant but humble we should humbly trust in god promise of truth just a we trust in hi promise of forgivenes rexlex it be only because of god own revelation that we can be rexlex absolute about a thing darren but how far do that get you once god revelation stop darren and ymy own reason begin possibility for error appear i agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teach of scripture and the product of my own reason even when such reason be base on scripture however i think i would draw the line of distinction more reasonably and le academically than you would darren for example let suppose that my modern bible translation darren include a perfect render of jesu word at the last supper darren and that jesu say exactly thi be my body darren we presume that what he say wa totally without error and darren absolutely true what can we be certain of not much darren at the moment he stop speak and person start darren interpret the possibility of error appear did he mean darren that literally or not we do not have any record that he darren elaborate on the word wa he think of tran or con darren substantiation he do say darren be almost at the point of make a very lutheran statement about the lord supper the lutheran approach be to say that if jesu say thi be my body then that be what we should believe other interpretation be reject simply because they be not teach in scripture recall that jesu word do not stand alone on thi subject we also have paul word in corinthian in which he pass on to u what he receive from the lord in particular he say for whenever you eat thi bread and drink thi cup you proclaim the lord death until he come by these word we should believe that the bread that we eat in the lord supper really be bread a well a the lord body a my sense in fact tell u do thi prove that tran-substantiation be false i suppose someone could say that paul speak metaphorically of the lord body a bread simply because that be the way the body appear when we eat it but thi think be find nowhere in scripture so we reject it thu the primary reason for reject tran-substantiation be not that we can prove it false but that it be simply not find in scripture side remark i be tell that the lutheran doctrine on real presence be con-substantiation but it ha be non-lutheran who have tell me thi we tend not to use the word i almost think that thi be use more by professor of comparative religion who need label to compare catholic lutheran and reformed teach on the lord supper but almost every church want to call their own teach real presence because that wa the traditional teach of the church end side remark darren when christian speak a if they believe their own reason darren can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we darren be infallible the non christian around u rarely believe darren that implicit claim witnessing be hardly go to work when darren the person you be talk to believe that you be either too darren foolish to recognise ymy own limit or intentionally try darren to cover them up thi be precisely why christian should not rely on rationalization in their witness it be far better to take the approach i like to show you what scripture say you decide for yourself whether to believe it or not darren rexlex suggest that person read he be there and he be not darren silent by franci schaeffer i do think very highly of darren it but i think that mr schaeffer be grossly overrate by many darren evangelical christian somebody else might like it though darren so do let my opinion stop you from read it darren if someone be interest in my opinion i suggest on darren certainty by ludwig wittgenstein a long a we trade reference i like to suggest dr siegbert becker paperback the foolishnes of god the place of reason in lutheran theology publish by northwestern publishing house thi book wa base on becker doctoral thesi at the university of chicago david wagner not by might nor by power a confessional lutheran but by my spirit say the lord almighty zechariah
