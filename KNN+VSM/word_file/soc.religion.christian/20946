from rexlex subject re certainty and arrogance in article kilroy dr nancy sweetie write someone call rexlex ha claim that there is a way out of the loop but he do not bother to explain what it wa prefer instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument lead to relativism i will answer thi a i find time rexlex suggest that person read he be there and he be not silent by franci schaeffer i do think very highly of it but i think that mr schaeffer be grossly overrate by many evangelical christian somebody else might like it though so do let my opinion stop you from read it if someone be interest in my opinion i suggest on certainty by ludwig wittgenstein darren f provine kilroy if any substantial number of reader read some wittgenstein of the post would disappear if they understand some wittgenstein would disappear michael l siemon notice what i say about thi book i call it easy read the reason i drop philosphy a my major wa because i run into too many pharisaical simon i do know how many walk encyclopedium i run acros in philosphy class the problem be in know sooooo much more than ymy average lay person the problem come when you become puff up about it schaeffer be just fine for the average lay person that wa who he wa writting to i suppose that you would have criticise john that hi gospel wa to simple i talk with schaeffer one on one i be in lecture with the man when he wa be drill by philosphy student and prof from secular a well a christian university nd alone would fill both those catagory hi answer be enough that the prof themself often be take back and cause to re-think what their question wa i saw thi time and time again at different open forum so ye schaeffer book be by in large well simplistic it certainly be grad level read but we must get off my high horse when it come to recommend read do you seriously think most person would get through the first chapter of wittgenstein i may have more to say about thi secular scientist at another time also one must finally get beyond the doubt cause by insistent inquisitivenes one can not live hi life constantly from a cartisian doubt base look the christian wholeheartedly support genuine rationality but we must add a qualification to give thi balance christianity be second to none in keep reason in it place we never know the value of a thing until we know it limit put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value thi be why xianity be thoroughly rational but not the least bite rationalistic it also explain the curiou fact that it be rationalism and not christian faith which lead to irrationality if we forget the limit of a thing we fly in the face of reality and condem ourself to learn the simple ironic lesson of life more without limit be le le with limit be more or a i have so often state it freedom without form soon become form freedom let put it another way the rationality of faith be implacably oppose to absurdity but ha no quarrel with mystery think about that it can tell the difference between the two if you will let it christianity contention with rationalism be not that it ha too much reason in it but that it ha very little else when a christian come to faith hi understand and hi trust go hand in hand but a he continue in faith hi trust may sometime be call to go on by itself without hi understand thi be where the principle of suspend judgment apply at such time if the christian faith be to be itself and let god be god it must suspend judgment and say father i do not understand you but i trust you now do read all ymy objection of me into that statement i wa say i do not understand you at all but i trust you anyway it mean that i do not understand you in thi situation but i do understand why i trust you anyway therefore i can trust that you understand even though i do not the former be a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity the latter be a statement of rationality of faith walk hand in hand with the mystery of faith so the principle of suspend judgment be not irrational it be not a leap of faith but a walk of faith a believer we can not alway know why but we canalway know why we trust god who know why and thi make all the difference now there be one obviou snag to all thi and thi be where i have part company with philosophy what be eminently reasonable in theory be a rather bite more difficult in practice in practice the pressure of mystery act on faith like the insistent whying of a year old it be just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we can not know the one produce frustration because curiosity be deny the other lead to genuine anguish more specifically the poorer my understand be in come to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after come to faith if we do not know why we trust god then we will alway need to know exactly what god be do in order to trust him failing to grasp that we may not be able to trust him for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we be able to trust if on the other hand we do know why we trust god we will be able to trust him in situation where we do not understand what he be do too many xian leader teach a if the christian have a window in the back of hi head which allow for understand at every foot fall for what god be do may be ambiguou but it will not be inherently contradictory it may be mystery to u but mystery be only inscrutable what would be insufferable be absurdity and that my friend wa the conclusion of nietzche both in theory and in practice rex
