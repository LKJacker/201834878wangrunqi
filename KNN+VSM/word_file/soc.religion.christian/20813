from mark baker subject re the arrogance of christian to what follow my moderator ha already answer the charge of arrogance more ably that i could have do so so i will confine myself to answer the charge of illogic in a previou article geno say if i do think my belief be right and everyone else belief be wrong then i do have a belief thi be simply what belief mean unfortunatly thi seem to be how christian be teach to think when it come to their religion thi be how everyone in the western intellectual tradition be or wa teach to think it be the fundamental premi a be not not-a if a thing be true then it converse be necessarilly false without thi basic asumption theology and science a we know them be alike impossible we should distinguish the strong and weak mean of the word believe however the weak sense mean i be not sure i believe tom go to the library but he could have go to the track the strong sense mean i be so certain that i use it a a basi of think i believe that nature operate accord to certain fundamental law despite the fact that nature appear capriciou and unpredictable christian belief be of the strong kind though christian may well hold belief of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topic some take it to the extreme and say that their religion be the only one and if you do accept their teach then you wo be save note that these be two separate idea most hold the first view but the majority do not hold the second is be again a matter of pure logic that if christanity be true then hinduism for example must necessarilly be false insofar a it contradict or be incompatible with christaianity and a a matter of logic vice versa it take quite a bite of arrogance to claim to know what god it be arrogant to claim to know what anyone think or want unles they have tell you christian believe god ha tell u what he think and want especially when it base upon ymy interpretation of a book most christian do not base their belief on the bible but on the live tradition of the church establish by christ and guide constantly by the holy spirit the bible be simply the write core of that tradition the logic in the above statement be faulty in that it assume two person with differ belief ca both be correct if depend what you mean by differ if i believe tom be six foot tall and you believe he weigh pound my belief differ but we may both be right if i believe tom be six foot tall and you beleive that he be fmy foot nine one of u at least must be wrong it all about perception no two person be exactly alike no two person perceive everything in the same way i believe that there be one truth call it god truth a universal truth or call it what you will i do believe god present thi truth i think it be just there and it up to you to look for and see it through prayer meditation inspir ation dream or whatever just because person may perceive thi truth differently it do mean one be wrong and the other be right thu you believe that there be a single truth but that no human be can find it you assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth be mistake in short you believe that anyone who do not share ymy belief on thi point be wrong qed a an example take the question is the glas half empty or half full you can have two different answer which be contradictory and yet both be correct so for ymy belief to be true do not require everyone else belief to be wrong here i begin to suspect that ymy real difficulty be not with the knowability of truth but simply with language saying that the glas be half empty be not a contradiction of the statement that it be half full it be the same fact express in different word the whole point of thi phrase be to illustrate the different way the pessimist and the optimist expres the same fact it be of course quite true that different person may expres the same belief in different word it be also true that they may fail to understand each other word a expression of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they be mile apart great scism have occur in just thi way and much ecumenical work ha be do simply in resolve difference in language which conceal agreement in belief thi do not mean in any sense that all belief be equally valid since some of the belief person hold contradict some other belief that other person hold after all obfuscation of language and culture in the expression of those belief have be strip away some of the belief that some person hold must necessarilly be false and it be neither arrogant nor illogical to say so if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct but if y be equivalent to not-x then one of u be wrong and a long a we hold my respective belief we must each regard the other a in error mark baker the task be not to cut down jungle but to irrigate desert c s lewi
