from subject re the arrogance of christian in article mark baker write i be ask you to believe in thing not visible i do know if thi be believe blindly or not i not sure how blindnes come into it i do not deny reason indeed i insist upon it but reason only draw conclusion from evidence if you decide in advance that ymy reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical sense then you cut reason off from any possibility of reach a conclusion outside the physical sphere beyond the rather provocative if inconclusive conclusion that the physical sphere be not self explanatory so ymy be say to rely on my feel and experience since thi be the only other source of information leave to u how can you then convince somebody that ymy feel and experience be the correct one then if you ca show somebody visible and measurable effect if my experience say that there exist no god and your say there do where do that leave u since we be only go on experience then both of u be correct within my own personal reality furthermore the trouble with feel and experience be that they can lead you astray a the tragic outcome of waco illustrate i be sure that many of koresh follower really believe in him but i think that you and i will agree that they be be mislead finally how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical sphere be not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five sense christian claim that they have receive a different kind of evidence which they call faith and which be a gift of god that be thi evidence be the evidence of a thing which choose to reveal or hide itself the evidence of the sense can not tell you be such a ting exist reasoning on the evidence of the sense wo help either but christian do reason of the evidence of faith and do claim that thi evidence be wholly consistent with the evidence of the other sense and indeed that the evidence of these other sense be part of god revelation of himself to u you must be use a definition of evidence that i be not familiar with to me evidence be something you can show other unambiguously that what you be say be true however i agree with you that belief in a diety be a matter of faith it be not something you can share around other must experience it independantly unfortunately a i have explain above thi put belief down to a matter of experience my impression be that christian do not have the monopoly on reason evidence and faith a far a any of these thing can go in a previou article say you be right that science and reason can not prove anything however if we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone and since we can only use faith why be one picture of god hinduism any le valid than another christianity faith a i have say be not oppose to reason it be simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate it be clear that human be have many system for explain the evidence of the physical sense and similarly there be many system for explain the evidence provide by faith religiou believer in general and christian in particular use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understand of the evidence provide by faith science claim with good reason to be the most valid system for explain the physical universe and christianity claim also with good reason to be the most valid system possess of the best evidence for explain god revelation of himself to man at the risk of repeat my argument a i have explain previously the trouble be that moslem buddhist jew etc will all say that they claim with good reason to be a valid system possess of the best evidence for explain god revelation to man for buddhist it should read for explain the non-existence of god so not only must you prove ymy own case you have to disprove their be a good place to see person strong in the belief of their own faith and with their own good reason if you doubt that christian use reason read thi newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty i know that all person can use reason i never claim that they do i just wish to make sure that their argument be well-founded it go without say that if i make a blunder that i expect person to correct me once we have all go through thi proces of remove the non-essential and contradictory bite we should hopefully have make some progress toward the truth mark baker the task be not to cut down jungle but to irrigate desert c s lewi don lowe department of physic monash university melbourne victorium australium
