from wagner david wagner subject re baptism require faith aaron aaron bryce cardena aaronc write aaron colossian in him you be also circumcise in the aaron put off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision do aaron by christ have be bury with him in baptism and raise aaron with him through ymy faith in the power of god who raise him aaron from the dead aaron in baptism we be raise to a new life in christ roman aaron through a personal faith in the power of god my parent aaron faith can not do thi do infant have faith let look at aaron what the bible ha to say about it ye let do try and if anyone cause one of these little one who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to be throw into the sea with a large millstone tie around hi neck mark let the little child come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belong to such a these i tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it the colossian passage do not make faith a requirement for baptism it merely say that in baptism we be bear again regenerate and resurrect through faith in the case of an infant i would say that baptism work faith in the heart of the infant through the power of the word the colossian passage do make baptism a spiritual circumcision circumcision wa the mean by which a male infant wa make a part of god covenant with israel it wa command to be perform on the eighth day the early church understand thi and even debate whether baptism have to be perform on the eighth day or if it could in fact be do earlier aaron roman but not all the israelite accept the good aaron news for isaiah say who ha believe my message aaron consequently faith come from hear the message and the aaron message be hear through the word of christ aaron so then we receive god gift of faith to u a we hear the aaron message of the gospel and the gospel be surely preach at any infant or adult baptism indeed in a very real sense the sacrament be the gospel make tangible aaron faith be a possible response to hear aaron god word preach kid be not yet spiritually aaron intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to aaron god word how do you know they be not yet mature enough to have faith do you know thi on the basi of god word or from ymy own reason faith be also describe a a gift from god ephesian he gife faith to infant just a he gife it to adult through the power of the gospel roman aaron if you read all of ezekiel you will see that god do aaron hold u guilty for anyone else sin so we can have no aaron original guilt from adam here you show that you just do understand original sin you be argue against a straw man maybe you be talk to catholic too much i do know but original sin do not consist of god imputation of adam guilt to u it consist of my inheritance of adam sinful nature it be actual sin see for example the augsburg confession article ius and the apology of the augsburg confession article ius and for extra credit john knox the scot confession article iius aaron now then that we have a little more background a to why aaron original sin be not biblical let look at some of the aaron scripture use to support it aaron roman therefore just a sin enter the world through aaron one man and death through sin and in thi way death come to aaron all man because all sin ask yourself thi question do infant ever die then ask yourself if infant baptism be not valid then where wa the christian church during all the century when almost all of the baptism be perform on infant were luther melancthon calvin zwingli hu knox andra and chemnitz christian aaron psalm surely i wa sinful at birth sinful from the time aaron my mother conceive me aaron thi whole psalm be a wonderful example of how we should humble aaron ourself before god in repentance for sin david himself aaron wa a man after god own heart and write the psalm after aaron commit adultry with bathsheba and murder her husband aaron all that david be say here be that he ca remember a time aaron when he wa sinful he be humble himself before god by aaron confess hi sinfulnes hi say that he wa sinful at aaron birth be a hyperbole the bible be inspire by god be aaron limit to a literal interpetation but also use figure of aaron speech a do jesu john for another example of aaron hyperbole see luke who be you to say what be literal and what be not is a literal interpretation manifestly absurd in psalm by reason of direct contradiction with a clear passage from the word of god you might also compare genesi the lord smell the please aroma and say in hi heart never again will i curse the grind because of man even though every inclination of hi heart be evil from childhood aaron we see aaron that he do grow and become wiser in luke and the aaron implication be that jesu do wrong thing a a child before he aaron know to choose right over wrong you be a long way from prove thi rather monstrou assertion all you can say be that jesu grow in wisdom and in stature a conclusion that he do wrong a a child be base on an extrapolation of reason not on a direct revelation in scripture david h wagner but mad reason rush forth and a confessional lutheran because baptism be not dazzle like the work which we do regard it a worthles martin luther large catechism fourth part baptism
