from rexlex subject re assurance of hell in article lfoard lawrence c foard write and many other mail me here be a reply to one of the letter seem to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell there nothing like a preacher to put fear into an ignorant man if god have create hell in the first place there be no no need to die and save u is it also a bite paradoxical to say god die when in fact no such thing be remotely possible can the infinite die ymy use century concept to interprete century writer of course in ymy termonology god could not cease to exist however that be not what death ever mean in the scripture if you will study the word you will see that it signify separation death be separation not ceastation thi be the reason for the agony of the cro for the first time in eternity one member of the godhead wa separate from the other two i once meet a young lady that wa a beautiful a any model that ever live she wa a personable a any saint ever imagine she wa to become my girlfriend for several year however have be draft we be separate by distance to me that wa a form of death later she decide that she could wait for me to come home and bid me adue that to me wa death it wa separation from that which have make me whole death be separation and eternal death be eternal separation from hi fellowship not because he choose to send you into outer darknes but because you choose to go there do you know that jesu talk more about hell than he do about heaven thank you for thi info what respect i have for the man now ha be diminish tenfold i promise never again to say how wise or love thi man wa when i rebel against my earthly father he spank me i find no wisdom in that until i have grow older and especially until i have my own child he wa try to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if i continue on my suicidal course he do it in love though i interpret it a harsh and unloving if god warn of impend danger that be love if choose to let u do a we please and then at the end tell u the rule that would be harsh you have a conscience no matter how calused or fall it be that witness to you that a thing be wrong and that there be cause for fear being jesu wa allegedly god i doubt he could honestly feel the pinprick man deal him thi may give light to the error of ymy understand one must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith faith and knowledge be inseparable jesu most certainly felt the pinprick of life a the scripture say heb for we do not have a high priest who can not sympathize with my weakness but one who ha be tempt in all thing a we be yet without sin the kenosi passage of phil state that he give up hi godhead attribute when he take upon himself humanity it ha be a favorite meditation of mine to think about thi it wa to be my phd thesi the consciousnes of christ i have talk at length with a great many person about thi interest study include clh it be my conclussion that a jesu the member of the trinity actually suffer a we do he become part of the human race and experience it a we do he grow in knowledge he choose not to grasp hi omniscience but choose to be teach it be my understand that he wa lead of the spirit to such an extent that sometime it be hard to distinquish between jesu the man and jesu a god but in jn where the adulterou woman wa throw before him the tense be quite clear in that the whole situation take him by surprise that be he wa not aware that thi event wa to take place in time he wa live sequential history a you or i maybe some other time we can discus thi but it be a very lengthy discussion and one that cause the curcuit breaker of the brain to pop more often than not thank again for the info just so you know some friend and i be start a freethinker organization and i go to use some of the info you provide for an organization intro duction i wa once a member of that club the free thinker be a gloriou ideal by contrast of course you believe that the believer be the unforunate repository of everything that be dogmatic inhibit reactionary and repressive i find such a stance to be a amuse a it be absurd if the liberal humanist wish to criticize a christian or a buddhist or a marxist that be hi right but what he must not pretend be that he wa lead to thi solely by hi rational doubt when in fact he wa lead to it by hi faith he must acknowledge that while it be rational doubt for him a a free thinker to criticize the christian it might equally be a rational doubt for the christian to criticize him a a humanist if there be no faith there can be no dout there be no faith which can not choose to cast doubt on some other faith pascal point out that sceptical argument allow the positive to be positive few speak dubiously of scepticism the fact that skeptic be not skeptical about skepticism be further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else the person who be skeptical toward one faith or even most faith will be the devote adherent of another in fact it be a measure of hi poverty both that he be unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative term hence the term a theist some person claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism in my campu ministry i run acros thi more time than i care to remember however they disprove their own argument with every think every word every point of logic that they use every moment of share communication speak against their total skepticism their very insistence of try to make sense be eloquent testimony to assumption that be powerful though silent that be to say that complete skepticism be impossible and limit skepticism be arbitrary next time you in a room of skeptic yell out look ymy fly be undo each person choose what he be skeptical about and what he believe without skepticism to stres thi be to belabor the obviou but it underline the point that no one can know exhaustively how he know what he know pure objectivism be a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity the answer to thi impasse ly in a way of know one which be base on presupposition but if knowledge proceed on what must be presuppose before it be prove the cover be blow on the pretention of critical doubt and critical doubt depend on the idea that human knowledge be totally objective and neutral in other word another myth presupposition my friend it be impossible to doubt anything unles there be something we do not doubt my own even these can be criticezed only upon the basi of other assumption presuppostiton be my silent partner in think but their silence must not be mistake for absence i tell you what if god condemn me for be honest he be unworthy of my worship better to burn in hell than to serve a tyrant in heaven of course that be hardly an original statement milton coin it but it have be in use for millenium it wa even use in the first highlander movie but again ymy presuption be base on a faulty knowledge of the character of god you be operate off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology not what he ha reveal of himself through history through hi prophet through hi word and lastly but most of all thru hi son if you be to reject god annointed savior then reject him from a correct understand of himself rex
