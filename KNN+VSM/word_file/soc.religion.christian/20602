from dlecoint subject re eternity of hell wa re hell vic vic kulikauska write my moderator write i incline to read description such a the lake of fire a indicate annihilation however that a minority view it my personal view but the only denomination i know of that hold it officially be the jw and sda i ca find the reference right now but do speculate somewhere that hell might be the state of once have be a human soul why be it that we have thi notion that god take some sort of pleasure from punish person the purpose of hell be to destroy the devil and hi angel to the earlier poster who try to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fall angel be not destroy remember the bible teach that god ha reserve them until the day of judgement their judgement be soon to come let me suggest thi maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it stay away from human theory and only take into account reference in the bible dariu
