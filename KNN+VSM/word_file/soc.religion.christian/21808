from cccamper elizabeth steven subject the easy way out easy v hard easy on who i have a rare very personal talk with my mother last year she say that when she and my father be raise we fmy child they do not try to raise u in thi world a strictly a they be raise in their norwegian lutheran community they felt that we would be alienate from them and it would create problem in other word my parent do the very tolerant love thing they raise u without conflict without what we saw a unreasonable demand and be alway accept no matter what the circumstance what happen wa that i grow up believe in situation ethic and never absolute i believe in a love god and my concept of god never involve justice or punishment nor wa there any concept that i may someday be hold responsible for the thing that offend him sin that the world tell me be ok my parent be very good honest and moral person they raise fmy extremely honest child yet before come to a more complete knowledge of god which include the knowledge of justice and punishment i commit what i now believe to be many many grave sin i live with a partner outside of marriage wa marry and divorce only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for change but i should have marry to person in the first place and more my parent felt they be do the love kind thing by allow u to be who we be by not impose their standard on u and by accept unquestioningly everything we do without judgement or counsel today it be absolutely appal for me to look back on what they do accept without a word it take courage to dare to help soul because you must speak up and say what be unpopular and difficult and what person do not want to hear you must be able to say what be hard and say it a christ would with love and compassion it involf risk perhap someone you love may not want to hear and will stay away from you thi life be but dust a long a the comfort of thi life be my highest priority we will fail god and fail those with whom we come in contact i wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage who support the right to abortion who engage in homosexuality or who commit any of the range of sin that be plentiful in thi time have ever hear from a quiet thoughtful love friend that these thing be wrong no one ever tell me that what i wa do wa wrong and i saw multitude around me live the same way i wa and they seem like good decent person would kick dog or beat the elderly or baby it be more difficult for sinner without a genuine prayer life to hear the holy spirit than it be to hear a love friend think about thi the next time the holy spirit tell you that a friend be in error but you do want to cause trouble righteou prayer be great power but do forget that we be we be christ lip and hand on earth do be afraid to simply voice truth when the situation call for it say a fervent prayer and ask the holy spirit for love and guidance in more way than we may realize we be my brother keeper in jesu and mary elizabeth
