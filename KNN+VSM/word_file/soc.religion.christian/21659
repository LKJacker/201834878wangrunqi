from rexlex subject arsenokoitai continue with dr deyoung article survey of new interpretation of arsenokoitai bailey bailey wa perhap the trailblazer of new assessment of the mean of arsenokoitai he take the term in i cor a denote male who actively engage in homosexual act in contrast to malakous effeminate those who engage passively in such act however he insist that paul know nothing of inversion a an inherit trait or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular cause and consequently regard all homosexual practice a evidence of perversion hence bailey limit the term reference in paul work to act alone and lament modern translation of the term a homosexual bailey want to distinguish between the homosexual condition which be morally neutral and homosexual practice italic in source paul be precise in hi terminology and moffatt translation sodomite best represent paul mean in bailey judgment bailey clearly deny that the homosexual condition wa know by biblical writer j boswell the most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary author be that of john boswell wherea the usual of thi term gife it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense boswell gife it a passive sense in an extend discussion of the term he cite linguistic evidence and common sense to support hi conclusion that the word mean male sexual agent active male prostitute hi argument be that the arseno part of the word be adjectival not the object of the koitai which refer to base sexual activity hence the term accord to boswell designate a male sexual person or male prostitute he acknowledge however that most interpret the composite term a active mean those who sleep with make their bed with man boswell basis hi interpretation on linguistic and the historical set he argue that in some compound such a paidomathe child learner the paido be the subject of manthano and in other such a paidoporo through which a child pas the paido be neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance hi point be that each compound must be individually analyze for it mean more directly he maintain that compound with the attic form arreno employ it objectively while those with the hellenistic arseno use it a an adjective yet he admit exception to thi distinction regard arreno boswell next appeal to the latin of the time namely draucus or exoletus these be male prostitute have man or woman a their object the greek arsenokoitai be the equivalent of the latin draucus the correspond passive would be parakoitai one who ly beside boswell affirm he claim that arsenokoitai wa the most explicit word available to paul for a male prostitute since by paul time the attic word porno fornicator and porneuon one commit fornication find also in the lxx have be adopt to refer to man who resort to female prostitute or simply commit fornication in the absence of the term from pagan writer such a herodotu plato aristotle and plutarch and from the jewish writer philo and josephu boswell find even more convince evidence for hi affirmation that arsenokoitai do not connote or even in the time of paul he also demonstrate it absence in pseudo-lucian sextu empiricu and libaniu he subsequently find it lack in all discussion of homosexual relation among christian source in greek include the didache tatian justin martyr eusebiu clement of alexandrium gregory of nyssa and john chrysostom chrysostom be single out for hi omission a final proof that the word could not mean homosexuality boswell next appeal to the omission of the text of i cor and i tim from discussion of homosexuality among latin church father cited be tertullian arnobiu lactantiu and augustine the last name use circumlocution other latin writer include ausoniu cyprian and minuciu felix the term be also lack in state and in church legislation by the sixth century the term become confuse and wa apply to a variety of sexual activity from child molest to anal intercourse between a husband and wife having survey the source boswell conclude there be no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakous connote homosexuality in the time of paul or for century thereafter and every reason to suppose that whatever they come to mean they be not determinative of christian opinion on the morality of homosexual act it be clear throughout that boswell define arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitute he even go so far a to conclude that paul would probably not disapprove of gay inclination gay relationship endure love between person of the same
