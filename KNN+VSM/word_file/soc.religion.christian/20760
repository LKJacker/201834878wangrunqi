from hedrick subject re doing the work of god desiree bradley ask u whether we should think of the serb a do god work in bosnium i refrain from post in hope that someone who be more familiar with the ot than i would answer but at thi point i feel i have to say something many thing about thi post bother me i know of not the slightest suggestion in the nt that christian should use force to propagate the gospel and the idea that we should not be concern about the death of moslem violate the heart of the gospel christ die to break down these distinction in him there be neither jew nor greek there be neither slave nor free there be neither male nor female if moslem do not know him we may preach to them but we do kill them furthermore the attack be between state not religion there be christian be attack a well one of the town under attack be one of the few place where christian and moslem be live together peacefully the precedent be suggest be from the ot there be in fact two different thing be allude to the first be from the entry into canaan for that to be a parallel we would need for god to have promise thi land through a prophet and we would need the war to be a holy war there be tight constraint on behavior in those attack any violation be likely to cause the israelite to be defeat rape would not have be tolerate while the account in joshua emphasize town that be totally destroy note that it wa possible for a town to make peace with the israelite and that once that wa do even when deception wa involve they be expect to honor it in contrast there have be many violation of agreement in thi incident i see no evidence that god ha grant bosnium to the serb a a promise land and if he have their behavior would have disqualify thi from be a holy war the other ot parallel be from later when israel wa defeat by assyrium and babylonium the prophet saw thi a a judgement on israel for her sin someone ask whether we should see thi a a judgement on the bosnian for their sin thi sound like a replay of the old claim that we should have doctor or hospital because illnes be god judgement ye even bad thing may be use by god for good that include action of bad person but that do justify them if you read the prophet you find them very clear that in attack israel the assyrian and babylonian be act a unintentional agent of god their intent wa to attack god person and they would be judge for it the fact that they be actually carry out god plan do excuse their action furthermore we should conclude from thi that all attack be judgement from god god explicitly interpret that case through hi prophet a far a i know he do not send any prophet to bosnium while i find it hard to see any good in the current fight i be sure god will eventually make good come out of bad but that do justify it and it wo save the person who be do it from judgement i be particularly concern about the implication of thi issue because of current tension between the west and moslem-oriented nation what we do not need be for moslem to conclude that christian think it ok to kill moslem the implication for the mid-east and even relation with american moslem could be quite seriou
