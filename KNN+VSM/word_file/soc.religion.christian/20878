from kilroy subject re certainty and arrogance my last article include thi quote if any substantial number of reader read some wittgenstein of the post would disappear if they understand some wittgenstein would disappear michael l siemon someone call boundary write thi quote seem a little arrogant do you think there be a convention call a smiley which look like thi it be suppose to look like a sideway smiley-face and indicate that the precede comment be suppose to be funny and i note that i have participate on for over five year i say mr siemon wa not too far off in the meat of hi reply mr boundary serve up an excellent example of what i mean by there be no way out of the loop i write that human brain be infest with sin and can be trust only in limit circumstance in reply mr boundary write i would beg to differ with you here the properly-formed conscience can be trust virtually all the time which just move the problem back one level how do you tell if ymy conscience be properly form the only way to tell be to presuppose that you be capable of judge the formed-nes of ymy own conscience in other word you can only be sure that ymy conscience be properly form if you assume that ymy evaluation can be trust assuming ymy conclusion save you a lot of time i grant but it not a valid way of reason unles you be infallible ymy judgement about ymy own think can not be certain therefore it be not possible to be certain ymy conscience be properly form whatever that be suppose to mean mr boundary then gife another paradigm example of the problem now you have hit on the purpose of the church it be by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation without the church christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sect the church be by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation how do you know presumably you believe thi because of some argument or another how do you know that the argument contain no mistake you write therefore although my mind be finite and susceptible to error my competence in arrive at inductive insight gife confidence in my ability to distinguish what be true from what be not true even in area not subject to the experimental method but there be a huge difference between confidence in my ability to distinguish what be true from what be not true and infallible i be confident about a lot of thing but absolute certainty be a very long way from confident thi discussion be about the arrogance of claim to be absolutely certain really go check the subject line saying you be absolutely certain be significantly different than say you be confident when you say that you be confident that invite person to ask why except in very limit circumstance when you say that you be absolutely certain it invite person to dismis you a someone who do not have any idea of hi own fallibility i have yet to meet anyone who believe in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of error in hi reason all of them every last one ha claim that he wa himself infallible the result ha be to convince me that they have no idea what wa go on darren f provine kilroy thi particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism i get the feel that the original poster regard a arrogant the very idea that there be right and wrong answer in religion and that the difference can have eternal consequence when i say that i think there be a hell and that he be at least in significant danger of end up there i will admit that a you say the reason process i use to reach thi be fallible thu at least in principle i could be wrong but these basic fact be clearly enough teach in the bible that i think it unlikely that i misinterpret it in order to get thi level of confidence i try to frame my statement sufficiently carefully a to sidestep a number of the more controversial issue i have for example say that all non-christian will definitely end up in hell and i have attempt to describe hell in any detail i have a feel that my view be go to be regard a arrogant and intolerant even though i acknowledge that i fallible and so there some chance i wrong do get me wrong i think there be a lot of genuinely arrogant christian and often criticism of u be justify but in at least some case i think the criticism constitute blame the messenger if the universe be set up so that there be eternal consequence for certain decision it not my fault i just tell it the way i think it be you may think god be immoral for set thing up that way it one of the critique of christianity that i find it most difficult to respond to but it not arrogance for me to tell what i think be the truth clh
