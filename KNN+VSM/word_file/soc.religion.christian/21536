from smayo scott a mayo subject re dream and out of body incident c david e goggin write i fairly new to these group tho some have hear from me before welcome i like to get ymy comment on a question that ha be on my mind a lot what apply to dream and out-of-body incident in normal dream you ca control anything so obviously you be morally responsible for ymy action hm i get a little queasy around the phrase be morally responsible perhap because i hear it misuse so many time i remember in college some folk try to argue that a person who wa drink wa not morally responsible for hi action in general most folk ca control their dream but perhap what you do all day and think about ha some impact on them hm and i not sure what action be in a dream but i will note that jesu do seem adamant about the fact that my thought-life be at least a important a my action go lightly with thi argument we be all morally responsible for who we be and dream might well be an important part of that now there seem to be alternative dream and oobe be totally mental phenomenon in thi case no morality apply beyond what might be call hygiene that be not try to think about anything evil or indulgining in overly sexy or violent think i do know a thing about out of body experience i have dream some fairly vivid one be an oobe just a very vivid dream i would argue that extreme interest in thi sort of phenomenon be a tad risky it be probably much better to think about who jesu be and who we be in relation to that than to cultivate a strong interest in dream unles you feel plague by dream that be painful and out of control then pray about it get help dream and oobe have a reality of their own be plane evidence for thi be that often dream and oobe be sometime do in common by more than one person what on earth be ymy definition of often i know exactly one case of two person who have substantially the same dream at the same time and a they be brother who have spend the day do the same thing i could see why their dream might be similiar anyway the only other plane i know of be the spiritual realm i do think dream perhap outside the occasional prophet represent actual action on an alternate plane if they be real action or consciou think then ye they would have direct moral significance like but here we assume that garble text because the dream occur in a different environment then different moral law apply be my gues of what you say i do see the slightest hint in christian write that one environment change the way a person determine what be moral for a christian wo it alway come down to what jesu would have u do so there it be is one of these case the truth or do anyone know of another alternative respond by post or email truth i do claim to be an expert in dream i note that the bible do talk much about dream outside of the realm of god use them to speak to u with the caveat that such message be not alway very clear a it warn somewhere in the ot given that i would not give them a lot of attention unles you feel ymy dream be try to tell you something i would discount talk of alternate plane though the only place such concept be commonly bandy about be for the most part hostile to christianity though i run into the occasional exception if you be or want to be a christian you want to be very careful about idea like thi
