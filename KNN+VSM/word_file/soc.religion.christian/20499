from hudson paul hudson jr subject re prophetic warning to new york city in article evensont evenson thoma randall write which bring me around to ask an open question is the bible a close book of scripture is it okay for u to go around say god tell me thi and jesu tell me that would that imply that god be still pour out new revelation to u i know that some person will feel that be okay and some will not the concept of a close canon would certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophet on the other hand an open canon seem to be indicate sometime there be a lot of person run around say god tell me thi and god tell me that these day some person really have hear god and other hear their gland mario murrillo mention thi in a sermon once he say someone tell him the lord give me a song he say that it wa the worst song he have ever hear i know why he give you that song murillo say he do want it anymore but god do still speak to hi person today and the idea be contrary to the idea of a close cannon ireneau write about all the gift of the spirit in the church of hi day and century and he wa one of the first to put forth a new testament cannon which wa almost identical to the one we have today he believe in a close cannon many prophet prophesy prophecy which be not record in the scripture for example one prophet in king whose name start with an m who prophecied that the king would lose a battle that be the only prophecy he give record in scripture and we no that he have give other prophecy because the king complain before he hear the prophecy he never prophesy anything good about me yet only one little paragraph of all of hi lifetime of prophecy be record in scripture there be numerou example barnaba wa a prophet act say before he wa even send out a an apostle yet hi write be not record in scripture only two of agabu prophecy be mention in scripture he wa already a prophet before he give them so prophecy may be genuine and from god but that do not make it scripture also interest to note be that some so call prophecy be nothing new but rather an inspire translation of scripture is it right to call that prophecy misleading would that be more have to do with knowledge i do know about translation of scripture but i be familiar with prophecy that give application for scripture there be also similar example in the bible several time peter interpret prophecy in a seemingly prophetic way for example and hi bishoprick let another take concern juda office a clearer example can be find in matthew jesu be prophesy about what will happen before hi return and he quote a passage out of joel about the sun be darken and the moon turn to blood so scriptural prophecy can be use in later prophecy sometime thi sort of thing can cro over into be a word of knowledge but gift of the spirit seem to overlap word of knowledge and wisdom can overlap the word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap interpretation of tounge be very similar to prophecy healing be often consider miracle so sometime the distinction between gift be a bite hazy imho it do usually matter that much if we be able to label a phenomenon a long a we recognize them a the work of the spirit and use them accord to hi lead link hudson
