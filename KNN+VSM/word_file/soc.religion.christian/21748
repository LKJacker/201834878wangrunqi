from mserv mail server subject christian homosexuality part of thi be a continuation of an earlier post ml michael siemon write for those christian who do think that some part of leviticu can be law for christian while other be not even to be think about it be incumbent on you in every case handle on it own merit to determine why you pick one and ignore another i frankly think the whole effort misguide reread paul no doubt i be free to do anything but christian have a criterion to use for make my judgment on thi the great commandment of love for god and neighbor if you can not go through leviticu and decide each command there on that basi then ymy own arbitrary selection from it be simply idiosyncracy in thi context it be remarkably offensive to say i notice that the verse forbid bestiality immediately follow the verse prohibit what appear to be homosexual intercourse i be sorry you find thi offensive it wa not my intent to offend i wa lead up to another point which i discus in more detail below well la-ti-da so what thi be almost a slimey an argument a the one that homosexuality rape i know of no one who argue seriously though one can alway find joker in defense of bestiality it be absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issue gay christian do raise which concern sexual activity within commit consensual human adult realtionship so that ymy bring it up be no more relevant than the law of kashrut if you can not addres the actual issue you be be bloody dishonest in trail thi red herring in front of the world if you want to addres bestiality that be ymy busines not mine and attempt to torpedo a seriou issue by use what be in my culture a ridiculou joke show that you have no interest in hear u a human be you want to dismis u and use the sleaziest mean you can think of to do so i can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceed my distaste for homosexuality certainly if i speak about homosexuality the way you speak of bestiality nobody would have any trouble label me a homophobe let me ask thi gently why be you so judgemental of other person sexual preference what happen to no doubt i be free to do anything i think you have a seriou double standard here when you describe a comparison between homosexuality and bestiality a slimey and sleazy you be make an implicit judgement that bestiality be pervert sinful disgust unnatural in short all the thing that society once think about homosexuality not all person share ymy view you claim not to know any sincere zoophile but thi do not mean that they do not exist they even have their own newsgroup are you go to accuse them all of be mere joker i notice you delete the main point of my comment the fact that the only biblical condemnation of bestiality occur in connection with the levitical prohibition against homosexuality while there be some new testament passage that can arguably be take a condemn homosexuality there be none that condemn bestiality one of ymy main point seem to be that christian homosexuality be acceptable due to the lack of any clear new testament statement against it if thi be a valid argument then should not christian zoophilium be make that much more acceptable by the fact that the new testament make no reference clear or unclear to the subject at all i be quite seriou here if i be go to accept homosexuality a biblically acceptable on the basi of ymy argument then i be go to be fair and apply the same standard to everyone else declare sexual preference a well if the argument you make for homosexuality can be apply to other sexual preference a well i go to apply them and see what come up i not try to torpedo a seriou issue by use what you label a ridiculou joke i post a question about how we should interpret biblical guideline for christian sexuality and i do think such a question be irrelevant in a group call the bible discus homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context and therefore i feel i have a good precedent for do the same jesu and paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length the central linch-pin of christian moral think we be require to love one another and all else depend on that gay and lesbian christ ian challenge you to addres the issue on those term and all we get in return be cheap debate trick attempt to side-track the issue i do know whether it make any difference but for the record thi be not a side issue for me i believe love one another include not encourage person to defile themself therefore it be of high importance to determine whether god regard certain sexual act a defile i can read in the new testament that god ha join together heterosexual couple and that the marriage bed be undefiled i can read in the old testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person be under the law if gay christian can validly put aside the old testament standard of defilement then i want to know so that i can fairly apply it to all the sexual practice that defile a person in the old day i do think it right to take just bite and piece of the law and try and apply them to christian today bestiality still defile you but homosexuality do that wa pretty much what you say earlier right you use different example but i think you say essentially the same thing about it be wrong to apply only certain part of the law to christian christian no doubt very sincere one keep show up here and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they ever do be spout these same old verse which they obviously have never think about maybe never even read in total ignorance of the issue raise slander u with the vilest charge of child abuse or whatever their perfervid mind can manage to conjure up toss out red herring with they suppose great emotional force to cause reader to dismis my witnes without even take the trouble to find out what it be it wa not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction i personally do get all that upset discuss alternative to the monogamou heterosexual orientation i afraid i naively assume that other would have a similar attitude please note that i have never intend to equate homosexuality with child abuse i have merely note that for all the lack of clear nt condemnation of homosexuality there be an even greater lack of nt condemnation or even mention of bestiality a practice which a number of person on consider to be their true sexual orientation such behavior should shame anyone who claim to have see truth in christ why for god preciou sake do you person quote irrelevant verse to condemn person you do know and wo even take the trouble to listen to before you start ymy condemnation is that love ymy neighbor god forbid is that how you obey the repeat command to not judge or condemn other christ and paul spend order of magnitude more time in insist on thi than the half-dozen obscure word in paul that you be so bloody ready to take a license to do what god tell you not to do why for god sake quote from john omit for brevity thi be an excellent question and i pray that you will not treat it a a mere rhetorical question but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer i recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude toward zoophilium why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it a slanderou to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientation why do you not apply all the same verse about love and tolerance to zoophile the way you apply them to homosexual is it because you automatically experience a subjective feel of revulsion at the think a lot of person have the same experience at the think of homosexual intercourse is it because you regard the practice a socially unacceptable a lot of person regard homosexuality a socially unacceptable do you feel that it violate the traditional judeo-christian standard of sexual morality many person feel that homosexuality do do you feel the bible condemn it many person think the bible say more to condemn homosexuality than it do to condemn bestiality why then do you think compare bestiality with homosexuality be insult to homosexuality if you can honestly answer thi question you will have come a long way toward understand why many person feel the same way about homosexuality a you feel about bestiality also please note that i be not in any sense condemn person i be merely point out that when i read the bible i see certain sexual practice that the bible appear to condemn sex outside of marriage when i say i think adultery and pre-marital sex be sinful do you take that a me fail to love my neighbor when you treat bestiality a something disgust and unmentionable be you disobey repeat order not to judge or condemn other when you say other christian be guilty of sin by condemn you and judge you be you by that accusation make yourself guilty of the same offense or be you and i both simply take note about practice the bible brand a sinful and leave the judgement of the person up to god for long age we many of u have be confuse by evil counsel from evil man and tell that if we come to the light we would be sham and reject some of u despair and take to course that probably do show a sinful shun of god light blessed be those whose spirit have be crush by the self-righteou they shall be justify however we have see the truth and the truth be the light of humanity and we now know that it be not we who fear the light but my enemy who fear the light of my witnes and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darknes of false witnes against u michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you nevertheles or you shall die like man and fall ml like any prince psalm i not sure what you mean by the above two paragraph if you mean that jesu be the truth and that he accept sinner and do not reject them then i agree if we be not sinner then we would not need a savior my salvation in christ however do not mean that sin be now irrelevant for u and we can now do whatever we want nor do christ grace mean that those who refer to sin a sin be be judgemental or intolerant i be speak in general term here not specifically about homosexuality if the bible call something sin then it be not unreasonable for christian to call it sin too a apply to christian homosexuality i think the only definitive authority on christian sexuality be the bible if you make a list of everything the bible say on the subject of homosexual intercourse i think you will find that every verse on the list be negative and condemn at worst and unclear at best the most pro-gay statement you could make about the list be that there be some dispute about the new testament verse which many person interpret a condemn homosexual intercourse that be from a gay perspective the most positive thing you can say about the bible treatment of homosexuality be that some verse fail to clearly condemn it that it jesu declare all food clean the council at jerusalem declare that gentile be not require to keep the ritual law but nobody ever reclassify homosexual intercourse from be an abomination deserve of death to be an accept christian practice you have verse describe homosexual intercourse a an abomination that defile both jew under the law and gentile not under the law and you have some verse which be at best not clear but which some person believe be clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior and that the sum total of what the bible say about same-sex intercourse i can appreciate from personal experience ymy desire to have everything simple cut-and-dried black-and-white what-i-want is-ok and those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked however i do not think the bible make ymy case a definitively a you would like it to in fact i do believe it say anything positive about ymy case at all ye i know the verse about love one another and not judge one another but that not really the issue be it you know and admit that there be still thing that be sinful for christian to do since you say it be wrong for christian to condemn you therefore the issue be whether the bible say homosexual intercourse be a sin even if you do challenge the clarity of the new testament verse you be still leave with the fact that the only thing the bible do say clearly about homosexual intercourse be that it be an abomination that defile both those who be under the law and those who be not mark actually i do think the reaction to the comparision with bestiality be base on bestialophobium i think what he regard a slimey be the rhetorical approach of connect homosexuality and bestiality most person who accept homosexuality take a radical approach to the law they regard all of lev a not bind on christian the argument be that there no way in the text to separate bestiality homosexuality and wear mix fabric thi do not mean that such person have no limit on their conduct nor do it mean that they accept bestiality it simply mean that their sexual ethic do not come from the law and particularly not from lev clh
