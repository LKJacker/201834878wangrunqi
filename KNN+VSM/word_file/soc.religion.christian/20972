from jason jason smith subject re atheist view on christianity wa re accepting jeesu in ymy heart in article kempmp petrus pihko write jason smith jason write the discussion begin why do the universe exist at all one of the law of nature specify cause and effect seem to dictate at least to thi layman mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exist i would argue that causality be actually a property of spacetime cause precede their effect and i must concede here cause before effect imply time time be part of spacetime hense the argument would be valid i could return and say that thi do not infer the cause and effect relationship be unique to thi spacetime but i wo because the point be moot do addres why which petrus pikho address below i also concede that i wa doubly remis a i assert no reasonable alternative exist an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidate give time and further discovery by the scientist i also understand that a prove a theory do not necessarily specify that thi be how it happen but propose a likely description of the phenomenon in question am i mistake with thi understand but if you claim that there must be an answer to how do the universe my spacetime emerge from nothing science ha some good candidate for an answer all of which require something we christian readily admit to faith the fact that there be several candidate bely that none be conclusive with out conclusive evidence we be leave with faith it could even be argue that one of these hypothesis may one day be prove a best a a non-repeatable event can be prove but i ask what hold someone today to the belief that any or all of them be correct except by faith a couple of paragraph delete summary we ask why do the universe exist i think thi question should actually be split into two part namely why be there existence why anything exist and how do the universe emerge from nothing it be clear science ha nothing to say about the first question however be it a meaningful question after all i would say it be consider the follow apparently it be for many person hence we have religion the question why anything exist can be counter by demand answer to a question why there be nothing in nothingnes or in non-existence actually both question turn out to be devoid of mean thing that exist do and thing that do exist do exist tautology at it best carefully examine the original question and then the counter-question the first ask why while the second be a request for definition it do addres why something do or do not exist but ask to define the lack of existence the second question be unanswerable indeed for how do we identify something a nothing be they mutually exclusive term how do we identify a state of non-existence again thi be near the limit of thi simple layman ability to comprehend and i would appreciate an explanation i might add the worldview of thing that exist do and thing that do do be a ground in the realm of the non-falsifiable a do the theist belief in god it be base on the assumption that there be not a reason for be something a ultimately un supportable a the position of there be a reason it very foundation exist in the same soil a that of one who claim there be a reason we come to thi either i be therefore i be or i be for a reason if the former be a satisfactory answer then you be do for you be satisfy and need not a doctor if the latter ymy search be just begin i seriously doubt god could have an answer to thi question time will tell some christian i have talk to have say that actually god be himself the existence however i see several problem with thi answer first it inevitably lead to the conclusion that god be actually all existence good and evil devil and angel u and them thi be pantheism not christianity agreed it would lead me to question their definition of christianity a well another answer be that god be the source of all existence thi sound much better but i be tempt to ask do god himself exist then if god be the source of hi own existence it can only mean that he ha in term of human time alway exist but thi be not the same a the source of all existence thi do not preclude hi existence it only seek to identify hi quality imply he exist to have quality btw the best answer i have hear be that human reason be incapable of understand such question being an atheist myself i do not accept such answer since i do not have any other method like the theist we come to a statement of faith for thi position assume that the evidence at hand be conclusive note i be not argue against scientific endeavor for science be useful for understand the universe in which we exist but i differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective i seek to understand what exist to understand and appreciate the art of the creator i also have discover science be an inadequate tool to answer why it appear that m pihko agree a we shall see but because a tool be inadequate to answer a question do not preclude the question asserting that be an invalid question do not provide an answer a far a i can tell the very law of nature demand a why that be true of something outside of nature thi be not true science be a collection of model tell u how not why something happen i can not see any good reason why the why question would be bind only to natural thing assume that the supernatural domain exist if supernatural be exist it be a appropriate to ask why they do so a it be to ask why we exist my apology i wa use why a why do thi come to be why do pre-existence become existence why do pre-spacetime become spacetime but we come to the admission that science fail to answer why because it ca be answer in the realm of modern science do that make the question invalid i do believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite have all of the part available just my opinion thi opinion be also call vitalism namely that live system be somehow fundamentally different from inanimate system do christian in general adopt thi position what would happen when scientist announce they have create primitive life say small bacterium in a lab i suppose we would do the same thing a when galileo or capernicu wa vindicate before someone start jump up and down scream inquisition note i say vindicate i certainly hope we get beyond the shoot the messenger stage m pihko do present a good point though we may need to ask what do i a an individual christian base my faith on will it be shake by the production of evidence that shatter my sacred cow or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagree with what god say and continue to say in hi word why do i ask why apology to budweiser and company jason jason d smith jason i not young enough to know everything
