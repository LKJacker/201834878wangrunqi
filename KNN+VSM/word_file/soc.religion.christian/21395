from muirm maxwell c muir subject re homosexuality issue in christianity can someone cite biblical reference to homosexuality be immoral other than leviticu so far when i ask around here i get the verse from leviticu spout at me but the whole rest of that book tend to be ignore by christian have see any stone in a long time later max bob muir the list wa post not long ago a i recall aside from lev commonly cite passage be the story of sodom note however that thi wa a homosexual rape and there no disagreement that that be wrong i take an intermediate position on thi note that sodom be refer to elsewhere in the bible for it sinfulnes it do seem to have be know specifically for homosexuality rather i think it wa consider a cesspool of all sin however from what we know of jewish attitude homosexuality would have contribute to the horror of the action describe it almost seem to have be contrive to combine about a many form of evil in one act a possible homosexual rape of guest who be actually angel but thi story be not specifically about homosexuality in the nt the clear reference be all from paul letter in rom there be a passage that presuppose that homosexuality be an evil note that the passage be about homosexuality it about idolatry homosexuality be visit on person a a punishment or at least result of idolatry there be a number of argument over thi passage it do not use the word homosexuality and it be refer to person who be by nature heterosexual practice homosexuality so it not what i call an explicit teach against all homosexuality but it do seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway that paul share the general negative jewish attitude toward homosexuality the other passage occur in list of sin in i cor and i tim unfortunately it not entirely clear what the word use here mean there have be suggestion that one ha a broader mean such a wanton and that another may be specifically male prostitute again we do have here a precise teach about homosexuality but it be at least weak supportive evidence that paul share the ot negative judgement on homosexuality jude be sometime cite however it probably not relevant the context in jude involf angel since those who be almost rap in sodom be angel it seem likely that strange flesh refer to intercourse with angel a you can see the nt evidence be such that person conclusion be determine by their approach to the bible conservative note that the passage from paul letter imply that he accept the ot prohibition thi be enough for them to regard it a have nt endorsement liberal note that there no specific teach and no clear definition of what be be prohibit or why be the concern in rom the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship what exactly do the word in the list of sin mean thu some believe it be legitimate to regard thi a a attitude paul take with him from hi background and not a specific teach of the gospel thi be an explosive topic which tend to result in long dissertation on the exact mean of variou greek word but it clear to me that that mostly irrelevant what it really come down to be whether person be look to the bible for law or whether they believe that such a approach be inconsistent with the gospel thi appear to depend upon one reaction to the message of the bible a a whole a well a one perception of the need of the church today thi be a difference of approach at least a seriou a the difference between protestant and catholic in the cent and one where both side believe that the bible be so obviously on their side that they keep think all they have to do be quote a few more passage and the other side will finally come to their sense that make thing very frustrate for a moderator who realize that such an optimistic outcome be not very likely clh
