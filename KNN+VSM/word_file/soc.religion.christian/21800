from revdak d andrew kille subject re is thi ethical just a quick comment a a baptist clergyperson i find the idea of such a baptism if the news report be in fact accurate and they seldom be regard religion offensive the pastor here seem to have a most unbaptist view of baptism one that seem to demand the ceremony even when comprehension and choice be absent we do baptize convert but no one who ha be deceive into hear the word be likely to be a convert if in fact the grace of god might work in such a situation there be no harm do in wait a day or two baptist believe in regenerate membership did thi church include these half-baked at best convert into their church fellowship or do they somehow feel there be some validity in dunk them and turn them loose thi kind of evangelism be certainly not baptist and probably not very christian either revdak
