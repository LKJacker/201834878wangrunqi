from noye vera shantus noye subject re serbian genocide work of god in article d andrew byler write do he believe in predestination of course i believe in predestination it a very biblical doctrine a roman show among other passage furthermore the church ha alway teach predestination from the very begin really you may be right but i like proof a far a i know and i be not a div school student the catholic church do not seem to accept predestination my chaplain tell me beware of greek bear gift with reference to thi doctrine it seem to have the curiou result that human be be not hold responsible for their own action i answer how you deal with thi in a minute but to say that i believe in predestination do not mean i do not believe in free will man freely choose the course of their life which be also affect by the grace of god however unlike the calvinist and jansenist i hold that grace be resistable otherwise you end up with the idiocy of deny the universal save will of god timothy right that do really seem like predestination to me but i continue with what you say for god must give enough grace to all to be save but only the elect who he foreknow be predestine and receive the grace of final perserverance which guarantee heaven thi do not mean that those without that grace ca be save it just mean that god foreknow their obstinacy and choose not to give it to them know they would not need it a they have freely choose hell thi be really confuse to me especially since i still believe that christ jesu die for all of u preknowledge of obstinacy seem like an awfully convolute way to account for a couple of verse but then i be not really biblically support in thi opinion or be i other person who be save be save by the grace of god and not by their own effort for it wa god who dispose them to himself and predestine them to become saint but those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they harden their heart and choose to perish thu they be deserve of god s punishment a they have reject their creator and sin against the work of the holy spirit so god use grace like margarine he only spread it where it need and not where it be and so there be the save and the not-saved and nothing in between hmmmm ye it be up to god to judge but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement well i would hold that a god most certainly gife everybody some bless for what good they have do even if it wa only a little for those he ca bles in the next life he bless in thi one although i realize thi doctrine wa not originally intend to cause social problem it end up do just that if there be suppose to be some sort of sign that someone be elect like lot of child or succes at work then those who have a good life on earth will go around think that those who do be doom to hell in a way though thi sound like the opposite idea those doom to hell will have a great life on earth that almost like the converse of what i believe responsibility for what we do now will be punish after we die you say what we get after we die ha a direct bear on how we live now strange and those he will not punish in the next life will be chastise in thi one or in purgatory for their sin every sin incur some temporal punishment thu god will punish it unles satisfaction be make for it cf samuel david sin of adultery and murder be forgive but he wa still punish with the death of hi child and i need not point out the idea of punishment because of god judgement be quite prevelant in the bible sodom and gommorrah mosis bar from the holy land the slaughter of the cannanite annia and saphira jerusalem in ad etc so sin be either punish now or later and not both what if it sort of half-punished be there any grey area in thi doctrine my stuff delete we should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf proverb but do that mean that christian should support a war in bosnium with the or even the involve i do not think so but i be an isolationist and disagree with foreign adventure in general but in the case of bosnium i frankly see no excuse for u get militarily involve it would not be a just war blessed after all be the peacemaker wa what my lord say not the interventionist my action in bosnium must be for peace and not for a war which be unrelated to anything to justify it for u the idea well my idea would be that you would intervene to establish peace and stop the atrocity i not suggest wwiius i do really understand what you mean by a just war of course i be not an isolationist although i see some merit in not jump in at the first opportunity can you say kuwait we happen to be a big country with a lot of resource a well a a lot of debt and thi gife u some responsibility in the world whether we like it or not flashback of wwius a well a vietnam should be haunt u yet another difference of opinion so be it andy byler thank you for answer i hope you do take any of my comment a flame but instead a expression of interest vera i be ymy clock i bind unto myself today vera noye i be ymy religion the strong name of the noye i own you trinity no disclaimer what lard st patrick breastplate be there to
