from hudson paul hudson jr subject re homosexual issue in christianity there some ambiguity about the mean of the word in the passage you quote both liberal and conservative source seem to agree that homosexual be not the general term for homosexual but be likely to have a mean like homosexual prostitute from what i understand of my experience in look up thi word and discuss it with a greek-literate individual the mean of the word be rather clear basically it literally mean he who bed with a man or he who ha sex with a man the burden of proof be on the pro-homosexuality side of the argument to show that the word ha an idiomatic mean nor evident from it literal mean one can speculate all day long that it might mean something else but we need evidence before we create new doctrine and get rid of the historical understand of the mean of thi word link hudson i read enough discussion of thi passage in both liberal and conservative source to be sure that the mean even the literal mean be not certain that do mean one ca come to some conclusion nor do it mean that i think there any doubt about what paul think of homosexuality but there be plausible argument for a couple of different mean clh
