from jek subject god morality and massacre a listmember d andrew killie i think write in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometime be the will of god any god who work that way be indescribably evil and unworthy of my worship or faith nobuya higgy higashiyama reply a in substance do other where be ymy source of moral standard by which you judge god behavior it be often argue that we have no stand by which to judge god action who be the clay to talk back to the potter but we find a contrary view in scripture when god propose to destroy the city of sodom genesi abraham say suppose that there be some good man in the city will you destroy the righteou along with the wicked far be it from you lord to do such a thing shall not the judge of all the earth do right i be tell that the hebrew be actually a bite stronger than thi and can perhap be better render dynamic equivalence a shame on you lord if you do such a thing there be those who say that the definition of good be whatever god happen to want but if that be so then the statement that god be good ha no mean it simply say that god do what he want that be the case no one can either love or obey god because he be good the only motive leave for obey him be that he be powerful just a it make sense to obey a dictator even when he tell you to round up all jew and exterminate them because if you defy him you might end up in the ga chamber yourself so it make sense to obey god because he ha the power to punish you if you do thi ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to genesi and to christianity in general any theory that make my moral judgement worthles make any further discussion of morality or of the goodnes of god meaningles however it do not follow that my moral judgement be alway infallible in particular case still le my judgement in particular case about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result when i read the scriptural account of the action of god in history those action often seem to me very different from what i might expect of a god who love u and desire what be best for u moreover leave the scripture aside and consider the natural world i find that nature be often very different from what i might expect if it be the work of a benevolent deity origen say those who believe that the author of nature be also the author of the scripture must expect to find in the scripture the same sort of difficulty that they find in nature now that some such difficulty should exist be not in itself an argument against the existence power wisdom and goodnes of god on the contrary their absence would be such an argument suppose that i be watch bobby fisher play ches and suppose that every time he make a move i find myself nod and say good move just what i wa expect him to do same move i would have make if i be play that would be a sign that fisher be no better a ches player than myself given that he be better i expect that at least some of hi move will have me think now what do suppose induce him to do that or even boy that wa a real slip he just throw the game away similarly if god understand the work of the universe better than i do it be to be expect that sometime it will look to me a if he ha make a mistake one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the control of the universe be that i can see the end of the ches game if fisher win i revise my earlier inference that it wa carelessnes that make him lose hi queen move earlier however if he losis and particularly if i can see that there wa a time when he have an opportunity for a checkmate in two move and do not take it then i know that he be not a good a player a i have think with god on the other hand i shall not in thi life see the total result of some of hi action therefore my grind for judge that i have see a bad move on hi part must alway be far shakier than my grind for make a similar judgement about fisher in the book of genesi we read that joseph ten older brother who with good reason find him insufferable conspire to sell him into slavery in egypt there he eventually become viceroy and when there wa a famine in canaan he wa able to provide for hi family when hi brother nervously apologize he tell them do not worry you mean to do me evil but god turn it into good i once hear a rabbi speak on thi text he say the history of the jew be largely a history of event that look like catastrophe that threaten the continue survival of the religion or the person or both but amazingly those event turn out to be the save of the jew and of judaism the sale of joseph by hi brother look like the breakup of the family but in fact it end with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them the famine that drive the family out of canaan look like a misfortune for them but in fact if they have stay in canaan they would almost certainly have intermarry with the canaanite and be assimilate into their culture their oppression by the egyptian a few generation after their arrival in egypt again look like a disaster but god use it to bring them out of egypt and into the promised land here the person build a temple and regularly offer sacrifice but the babylonian capture jerusalem and judea destroy temple and city and countryside and deport most of the person to babylon you might have think that that would be the end of the person and the religion but it wa not living in canaan the person have be under constant danger of assimilation again and again they have turn from the worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility cult with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice the babylonian captivity put a stop to that never again do the jew show any interest in polytheism or idolatry neither the worship of the canaanite mor that of the babylonian ever again have a foothold among them nor be that all judaism have be in danger of become simply a system of sacrifice and temple observance the only prescribe act of worship consist of come to jerusalem every so often and offer a sacrifice during the captivity with the temple go the jew invent the synagogue a place of meet for read and study and discussion of the scripture they come to realize clearly what they be in danger of forget while they continue to live in judea that god be not simply a local or tribal deity not just the controller of the land of canaan or the patron of the jewish person but the creator of the world and the ruler and judge of all human everywhere time pass and the babylonian empire wa replace by that of the persian and then that of the greek or rather the macedonian the ruler antiochu epiphane wa determine to stamp out judaism and to thi end he make the read and the study of the torah punishable by death again one might think that thi would be the end of judaism but it wa not the person meet for worship and instead of read the torah portion appoint for the day they would read some passage from the prophet that have a similar theme and then discus that before thi time the torah the so-called five book of mosis genesi exodu leviticu number and deuteronomy be the only book read and study in the synagogue if it have not be for antiochu the book of the prophet would probably have be forget altogether hi hatred for judaism save them other example here omit for brevity sake some of you may remember that julie andrew first become famou a eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair lady when warner brother undertake to make a movie of it everyone expect that julie who have be so magnificent on stage would play the same role in the movie instead the studio decide to go with an establish screen star and cast audrey hepburn julie andrew wa naturally crush but she later realize that if she have play the screen role she would have be type-cast for life a an elize doolittle type it would have be a disaster for her a it wa walt disney offer her the role of mary poppin and she win an oscar for it at the presentation she stand there smile and look at walt disney she say and now my special thank to the man who make all thi possible jack warner it wa the most memorable line of the even in a similar spirit we jew might thank the man who in the providence of god have preserve judaism and keep it alive to thi day begin with joseph brother and continue with two pharaoh with nebuchadnezzar with antiochu epiphane after the formal meet have break up one woman come up to him privately and say you be talk about the holocaust be you he answer if that be an example that come to ymy mind then you be right i wa talk about it to you but i would not talk about it to everyone for not everyone can bear it i assume that he mean that without the holocaust there would have be no state of israel someone hear the rabbi lecture might leap to the conclusion that god be dependent on the wickednes of man to accomplish hi purpose or at least that the rabbi think so he might then go on to suppose that the wickednes be in fact god do that he stir up joseph brother to a murderou hate against him and that when the israelite be in egypt god harden pharaoh heart so that he oppress the person and would not let them go and thi raise question about how an action can be consider wicked and at the same time be consider something that god ha bring about i suggest another way of look at it consider a sculptor who ha a log of wood from which he propose to carve a statue but the log instead of have a smooth even grain throughout ha a large knot that spoil the appearance of the surface the sculptor consider the wood for a while and then carf a statue that feature the knot that make that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue so that observer will say how fortunate the sculptor wa in find a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place it presence be the crown touch the thing that make the statue a great work of art in reality the knot far from be what the sculptor wa look for wa a challenge to hi skill if the wood have not contain that flaw he would still have make a great work of art but a different one so if joseph brother have not sell him god would still have bring about hi purpose for the jewish person but he would have do so in another manner if juda have not betray jesu if caiapha and hi fellow leader have not reject jesu but have rather acknowledge him a the annointed of god if pilate have follow hi conscience rather than hi fear and have set jesu free it might appear that there would have be no crucifixion and therefore no redemption and therefore no salvation not so god do not need juda sin to redeem u if juda have do right then god in christ would still have reconcile the world to himself we do not know how just a we do not know how michelangelo would have paint the sistine chapel if it interior have instead be shape like grand central station and just a we do not know how bobby fisher would have win hi fourth game agianst spassky if spassky have refuse the exchange of bishop and have attack fisher knight instead do bother to look up the game in question i be make up thi example but the point be none the le valid thu we may say both that god use say the cowardice of pilate to accomplish hi purpose and that the say cowardice wa not god do and that pilate would not have thwart god plan by behave justly and courageously what then be we to make of the place where god say to mosis i will harden pharaoh heart so that he will not let the person go some christian have take thi to mean that pharaoh wa a puppet with god pull the string and that hi stubbornnes and cruelty be not hi own work but the work of god in him i suppose rather that what god wa tell mosis wa something like thi if you see that pharaoh be not will to let the person go do not be discourage or suppose that the situation be out of my control my purpose will not be thwart if pharaoh choose to hear you and let the person go well and good if he do not i will fit hi resistance into my plan and fit it so perfectly that future historian and theologian will suppose that i would have be throw for a los if pharaoh have obey me to return to the question that start thi all off is it possible that the serb in slaughter the moslem of bosnium be instrument of god will first point what they be do be wrong just a what joseph brother do wa wrong just a what juda do wa wrong they intend it for evil if god somehow bring good out of it that do not make them any le subject to just condemnation and punishment second point of course god will bring good out of it but not the same good that he would have bring if the serbian have refrain from the sin of robbery and rape and murder nor do the good he purpose excuse u from the duty of do what be right your jame kiefer
