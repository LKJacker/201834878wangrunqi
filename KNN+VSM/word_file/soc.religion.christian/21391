from michael d walker subject re the doctrine of original sin just a quick reminder the way you be interpret those passage be ymy opinion you make it sound a if ymy opinion be somehow an undisputable fact many would interpret the passage you cite very differently many have several of the great theologian you mention do that very thing these be person who have much more expertise in the interpretation of scripture than you or me or probably anyone read thi newsgroup to say that all of them be wrong and you be right be in my opinion notice those last three word come pretty darn close to the sin of pride in the future i would suggest you not be so absolutist in ymy interpretation especially when contradict highly respect doctor of christianity mike walker univ of illinoi
