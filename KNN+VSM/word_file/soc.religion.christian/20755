from smayo scott a mayo subject re proof of resurection jsledd jame sledd write finally there be no proof of the resurrection of christ except in my spirit communion with hi and the father it be a matter of faith belief without logical proof incedently one of the largest stumble block for rational western man myself include i hope that thi be take in the spirit it wa intend and not a a rejection of the resurrection occurance i beleive but i want to point out the weaknes of logical proof term be be use in a load way here logical proof be an extremely messy thing to apply to real life if you think otherwise try to construct a proof that yesterday happen obviously it do anyone old enough to be read thi wa there for it and remember that it happen but proof a proof start with axiom and go somewhere you need axiom to talk about logical proof you can say that you remember yesterday and that you take a axiom that anything you clearly remember happen i could counterclaim that you hallucinate the whole thing to talk about proof of historical event you have to relax the term a bite you can show evidence not proof evidence of the resurrect jesu exist proof do not i think christianity go down in flame if the resurrection be ever disprove i also think that thi will not happen a the evidence for the resurrection be quite good a these thing go it be not entirely fair to claim that you can only take the resurrection on faith there be reason to believe it that appeal to the mind too
