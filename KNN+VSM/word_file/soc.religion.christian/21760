from ml michael siemon subject re arsenokoitai nt meaning of meta-exegesi conviction of sin part ius let me return to the question stipulate that paul mean hi use of arseonkoitai to refer more or le exactly to the levitical prohibition of male-male sex in order to bring out the problem most clearly i also stipulate what i think be far le plausible that paul coin the term for thi usage the question i want to turn to be what that would mean for paul reader and for later christian thi should be shorter than my last note a we will see that thi question rapidly confront u with some of the major division within christ body and i be not try to open the gate for flame acros any of the terrible chasm that separate any of u from my fellow christian my own bias loosely characterizable a liberal will be evident but i be not grind an axe here so much a try to get all party to see that it may be hard to reach closure when the issue involve strike at the heart of what we each in my own different way see a crucial to the gospel of christ so stipulate paul intent the immediate question be how can hi reader understand thi intent and follow on that question there be a second one what is my proper action if we do manage to understand him since paul gife not a single clue about hi mean in the text of corinthian there be two positive answer and one negative to thi question a paul or apollo or someone in the apostolic community ha convey to the corinthian the then-traditional jewish condem nation of homosexual behavior and paul expect them to be sufficiently well-tutored by thi tradition that he need no futher explanation i should note that there be no evidence in the letter or in corinthian for such a supposition b the spirit will teach u what paul mean or if not paul what god mean behind paul inspire word-choice c we know and can not gues to within any better pre cision here than for comparison in the parallel use by paul in the same passage of the word pleonektai those who have more if you think that areseonkoitai be obviou from it root try cut ymy tooth on thi word the neb translate it a grabber or even methusous drunkard at least thi ha the advantage of be a common insult so that at least there be some hint a to it mean the three position more or le if i can be allow some exaggeration for the sake of argument define a classical catholic attitude toward tradition one form of protestant sola scriptura and a demand for evidence all three position have strength and weakness ad a it be unquestionable that the gospel wa preach in and by the community of christ disciple and their successor and that my nt scripture itself emerge from thi communal tradition but it also the case that we know little or nothing about thi tradition until almost a century after paul which be to say that we have acces to the tradition only after several generation of possibly confuse transmission the scripture be itself my only documentation of the tradition in the critical era ad b if we be not bear of water and spirit to revert to john in an attempt to explain paul then we have no more hope of under stand the gospel than nicodemu have neither the tradition of man nor the vain elevation of my own reason can prevent the spirit from blow where it will the paraclete be a kamikaze but the downside of protestant belief in the efficacy of the spirit a my guide in scripture be that the wing of protestantism that take thi most seriously be also the most fragment over divergent understand supposedly derive from the clear word of god note classical lutheran calvinist and anglican think constrain scripture to be read within tradition even while reserve judgment against tradition out of scripture the more bizarre form of i will read scripture my way be primarily a fringe aspect of cultic protestantism the main problem with thi approach be that there be apparently no mean for one person to convey to another what that one may feel be teach receive from the spirit and history show incredible conflict between christian on thi point each in hi own mind convince that he be lead by the spirit no one can seriously urge point b without some sense of it potential for set christian against christian to what purpose ad c the critical approach ha the distinct advantage that when it can reach a conclusion it can lay out the datum in a way which be open to all the weaknes be an obviou corollary thi be not usually possible if i may say a word here out of my own already acknowledge bia one complaint against critical methodology be that it dissolf faith but surely a faith that can not honestly face the evalu ation of evidence ha problem which mere theology be helples to addres anyway there be a seriou and unfortunate possibility of schism between liberal and conservative position mostly on the basi of extreme zealot of position b and c a catholic sense of authority and tradition tend to constrain argument of b contra c to secondary position so that despite horrendou strain rome be not a likely to find these issue a ultimately divisive a the protestant world will and anglican will i predict muddle through on the vium medium attempt to give each position it due but no more than it due second question suppose tradition tell u and lot of spiritual christian tell u and critical think at least admit a possible that paul be refer to a flat universal levitical prohibition against male-male sex what then again we can abdicate my personal responsi bility to tradition and let it dictate the answer but it precisely where inherit tradition be not question that they most dangerou we have example of christ question the pharisee and their use of tradition despite hi urge in matthew that we be to heed them we have example of peter and more radically still paul jettison the tradition that they be lead by the spirit to call into question jesu and peter and paul do not so much throw out tradition a subject it to radical criticism on a couple of very basic grind the weightier demand of the law justice and mercy and good faith matthew and on these two commandment love god neighbor hand the whole law and the prophet also matthew if there be a fundamental because derive from christ validity in the challenge to some tradition a validity that lead the first generation to go so far a to waive application of the torah to gentile convert vastly beyond anything that be directly deducible from jesu report word and deed it signify to me a certain failure of the imagination to postulate that only the tradition that we have specific challenge against be in fact open to challenge all tradition pass through man be tradition of man that god may lead u even so that these tradition be a source of my spiritual instruction i will freely grant but tradition be inherently human and inherently corruptible and give the fall corrupt nothing in it be immune to challenge when the spirit show u a failure in justice mercy and good faith nothing may ultimately stand unles it do follow from love of god and love of neighbor i be perfectly will to grant that i could be blind to my own sin that the spirit may have teach another what she refuse to teach me or i be too dense to learn that tradition might have value here but what i know of tradition be that on one occasion some superstitiou christian appeal to justinian after an earthquake in asium minor and scapegoated sodomite a the cause of the earthquake so that legislation wa pass make homosexual behavior a capital offense if that be in accord with the gospel of christ then i be no christian that be human tradition at it most hateful and viciou and i see nothing all that much different in all the unbidden eruption onto usenet of person who be quick to condemn but slow to understand if that be the lead of the spirit then i want no part of it but what i have find in obedience to the lord be that i be myself totally dependent on the witnes of other christian for the truth that life in the body of christ and i say to all who doubt that gay christianity be from god what gamaliel say to doubt pharisee who would have suppress the earliest church be careful how you deal with these person if thi enterprise thi movement of their be of human origin it will break up of it own accord but if it do in fact come from god you will not only be unable to destroy them but you might find yourself fight against god act all i ask be that you listen to ymy tradition and read ymy scripture with a mind and soul open to the spirit and to the past history of my first christian witness willingnes to challenge tradition and other read of scripture though read with all the authority of scribe and rabbi and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of god and neighbor then study the evidence learn the history of christian oppress christian out of their tradition and eagernes to judge where jesu and paul tell u not to judge and let the witnes of the spirit in the life of ymy fellow christian include those who be not of ymy preference in theology guide you toward god truth michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you nevertheles or you shall die like man and fall ml like any prince psalm there a certain ambiguity in ymy discussion of position a a to whether you speak of tradition in paul time or our i think there be two way to use tradition one be to say that when paul and hi reader share a tradition it make sense to interpret hi word in the context of that share tradition that what make me think that these argument over word turn out to be silly we know that paul come out of a background that wa rather puritanical on sex everything else he say on sex be consistent with that background the tone of hi remark on homosexuality in rom be consistent with that background even if the word in the sin list be the most general term for homosexual activity and it seem to me that there some evidence that they be not they be just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be will to believe with no evidence at all that paul share the common jewish rejection of homosexuality but when you identify a with the catholic position that rather a horse of a different color the catholic position involf a continue church tradition argument specific to that tradition might be we can get guidance on how to interpret paul original mean from tradition the way the church father interpret him and we gain confidence that hi prohibition still apply in my time because of the universal judgement of the church between hi time and our i think thi be a somewhat different use of tradition a radical protestant might be will to use know cent tradition to illuminate paul original mean but not use the catholic position to answer the question of what my own attitude to homosexuality should be clh
