book and booklet hinn ha sell more book in the last couple of year than swindoll and dobson combine fred price ha the largest church in term of seat capacity in the usa do sound like much hunt be need it be scriptural to expose doctrinal error i give some verse to you before more can be give most of the epistle be write due to error doctrinal practical in the church the early church have numerou council to expose error and heresy it not a new thing remember luther zane i would like to point out though that historically those who hunt heretic often end up cause a bigger me than the heretic but thi be my un document opinion my reply if you can provide documentation it would be appreciate read ephesian esp v and and tell me what cause disunity and immaturity in the body eph till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullnes of christ that we should no longer be child toss to and fro and carry about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of man in the cunning craftines of deceitful plot disunity contrary to popular opinion be cause by expose error it cause by error zane there be many who probably give no place for see the scripture a document a spiritual development or growth in it writer but i would suggest that the fiery paul of the letter to the galatian mellow and mature into the one who losis all for the sake of love in the end my reply most scholar believe paul write timothy last let examine hi admonition to tim to ascertain how mellow he have become hold fast the pattern of sound word which you have hear from me in faith and love which be in christ jesu that good thing which wa commit to you keep by the holy spirit who dwell in u thi you know that all those in asium have turn away from me among whom be phygellu and hermogene be diligent to present yourself approve to god a worker who do not need to be ashamed rightly divide the word of truth but shun profane and idle babble for they will increase to more ungodlines and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeu and philetu be of thi sort who have stray concern the truth say that the resurrection be already past and they overthrow the faith of some and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correct those who be in opposition if god perhap will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their sense and escape the snare of the devil have be take captive by him to do hi will for of thi sort be those who creep into household and make captive of gullible woman load down with sin lead away by variou lust alway learn and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now a janne and jambre resist mosis so do these also resist the truth man of corrupt mind disapprove concern the faith but they will progress no further for their folly will be manifest to all a their also wa ye and all who desire to live godly in christ jesu will suffer persecution but evil man and impostor will grow worse and worse deceive and be deceive but you must continue in the thing which you have learn and be assure of know from whom you have learn them and that from childhood you have know the holy scripture which be able to make you wise for salvation through faith which be in christ jesu all scripture be give by inspiration of god and be profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousnes that the man of god may be complete thoroughly equip for every good work preach the word be ready in season and out of season convince rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and teach for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but accord to their own desire because they have itch ear they will heap up for themself teacher and they will turn their ear away from the truth and be turn aside to fable but you be watchful in all thing endure affliction do the work of an evangelist fulfill ymy ministry alexander the coppersmith do me much harm may the lord repay him accord to hi work you also must beware of him for he ha greatly resist my word zane the picture i have of paul be not of one who go out of hi way to destroy the ministry of wolf but of one who teach the sheep with many tear the necessity of absolutely not allow themself to be transform into wolf to protect themself my reply act therefore i testify to you thi day that i be innocent of the blood of all man for i have not shun to declare to you the whole counsel of god therefore take heed to yourself and to all the flock among which the holy spirit ha make you overseer to shepherd the church of god which he purchase with hi own blood for i know thi that after my departure savage wolf will come in among you not spar the flock also from among yourself man will rise up speak perverse thing to draw away the disciple after themself therefore watch and remember that for three year i do not cease to warn everyone night and day with tear zane for all the warn paul do it be of note that he never once drop a name of a wolf but i will admit he cry in hi beard at the end over those who have abandon him everyone in asium wa it my reply paul mention name thi charge i commit to you son timothy accord to the prophecy previously make concern you that by them you may wage the good warfare have faith and a good conscience which some have reject concern the faith have suffer shipwreck of whom be hymenaeu and alexander whom i deliver to satan that they may learn not to blaspheme thi you know that all those in asium have turn away from me among whom be phygellu and hermogene but shun profane and idle babble for they will increase to more ungodlines and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeu and philetu be of thi sort who have stray concern the truth say that the resurrection be already past and they overthrow the faith of some for dema ha forsake me have love thi present world and ha depart for thessalonica crescen for galatium titu for dalmatium alexander the coppersmith do me much harm may the lord repay him accord to hi work you also must beware of him for he ha greatly resist my word so do john i write to the church but diotrephe who love to have the preeminence among them do not receive u therefore if i come i will call to mind hi deed which he do prate against u with maliciou word and not content with that he himself do not receive the brother and forbid those who wish to put them out of the church jesu also single out teach and doctrine rev but i have a few thing against you because you have there those who hold the doctrine of balaam who teach balak to put a stumble block before the child of israel to eat thing sacrifice to idol and to commit sexual immorality thu you also have those who hold the doctrine of the nicolaitan which thing i hate or else i will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth rev nevertheles i have a few thing against you because you allow that woman jezebel who call herself a prophetes to teach and seduce my servant to commit sexual immorality and eat thing sacrifice to idol and i give her time to repent of her sexual immorality and she do not repent indeed i will cast her into a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation unles they repent of their deed i will kill her child with death and all the church shall know that i be he who search the mind and heart and i will give to each one of you accord to ymy work zane i question too the purpose of those who write book and build ministry on the fault deliberate or otherwise of other maybe if they would wander around in the desert eat locust and honey or barely cake with no worldly good at stake money to be make or no reputation to maintain i would question their motive consciou or otherwise le my reply i wo comment on thi because it deal with the intangible motive of other but even if they have bad motive remember what paul say phi some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife and some also from good will the former preach christ from selfish ambition not sincerely suppose to add affliction to my chain but the latter out of love know that i be appoint for the defense of the gospel what then only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth christ be preach and in thi i rejoice ye and will rejoice zane if we want to be true to the admonition of scripture many of which you list about protect ourself and the flock from wolf and wind of doctrine i suggest we start by allow the wolf-program in my own noetic pasture to be nail to the cros my reply please explain zane secondly i suggest any heresy hunt be restrict to my own fellowship which in the strict scriptural sense be the local city-church my reply if heresy wa not be propagate over the ma medium then it may not be need to go ma medium with the exposure unfortunately heresy be be teach not just in copeland church or hagin or hinn or price but all over the radio in print etc no pastor or church leader know what material the sheep be feed on outside the church it imperative that leadership be make aware of thi and cic do just that also let examine a passage of scripture eph and he himself give some to be apostle some prophet some evangelist and some pastor and teacher eph for the equip of the saint for the work of ministry for the edify of the body of christ these ministry gift that the lord install in the church be not just for one individual church but for the body of christ paul wa an apostle he travel all over distil hi message he wa also a teacher for thi reason i have send timothy to you who be my beloved and faithful son in the lord who will remind you of my way in christ a i teach everywhere in every church but a god ha distribute to each one a the lord ha call each one so let him walk and so i ordain in all the church also and god ha appoint these in the church first apostle second prophet third teacher after that miracle then gift of heal help administration variety of tongue eph till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullnes of christ notice that the five-fold ministry be go to be around till the church be in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man thi i believe will not occur fully until the lord jesu return see but god want the body to continue on mature what hinder maturity and unity of the body eph that we should no longer be child toss to and fro and carry about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of man in the cunning craftines of deceitful plot it clear that false doctrine integrate into the church by the trickery of man cause disunity the thing we be strive for and spiritual immaturity the church continue in spiritual childhood when christian be toss to and fro and carry about with every wind of doctrine the five fold ministry of which there do not appear to be clear scriptural denominational boundary pastor appear responsible for their individual flock be to deal with these doctrine when necessary in their struggle to equip the body all believer be call to do thi to a degree jud beloved while i wa very diligent to write to you concern my common salvation i find it necessary to write to you exhort you to contend earnestly for the faith which wa once for all deliver to the saint for certain man have creep in unnoticed who long ago be mark out for thi condemnation ungodly man who turn the grace of my god into lewdnes and deny the only lord god and my lord jesu christ zane if you notice in scripture the heresy hunter that go from church to church and area to area be the bad guy and they go after the good guy namely paul who they consider to be the arch heretic my reply they be themself heretic try to discredit paul who wa preach contrary to what they teach zane let face it the wolf be here for a reason and we be here for the reason and let hope the wolf become sheep and the sheep lamb my reply ye and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correct those who be in opposition if god perhap will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their sense and escape the snare of the devil have be take captive by him to do hi will aman frank if one wish to contend with him he could not answer him one time out of a thousand job
