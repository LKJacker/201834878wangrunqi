from gerry palo subject re good jewish argument kwfinken kevin w finkenbinder write scott write intro delete jesu wa really descend from david a the messiah wa suppose to have be joseph wa but christian say that joseph wa relate to jesu truthfully if you look at the geneology of christ in luke and the one in matthew you will notice that they trace different line back to david i have be tell that one trace mary line back to david and the other trace joseph line back to david both of them go beyond david in history acording to some of my jewish friend jewishnes be pass to a child by the mother and the legal right of jewishnes be pass through the father if it be true that one of these geneology be mary then christ bloodline be from david through hi mother thi also mean that christ have all of the legal right of a decendant of david a accord to at least roman law and possibly mosaic law a well but i be not sure joseph wa christ legal father the argument for luke genealogy be that of mary be very weak according to luke and when he begin hi ministry jesu himself wa about thirty year of age be supposedly the son of joseph the son of eli aside from the fact that mary be not mention there be two possible interpretation either joseph wa her father or he wa her brother clearly thi be not acceptable a third would be that joseph the son of eli wa her father and just happen to have the name a the man to whom she wa betroth but that would seem to be grasp at straw the most straightforward interpretation be that luke have no intention of trace mary genealogy in which case he would have name her but that he trace her husband from david son nathan the matthew descendant list most definitely trace down from david son solomon to joseph matthew read and to jacob wa bear joseph the husband of mary by whom wa bear jesu who be call christ there be two apparent problem the first be how to reconcile the two paternal genealogy which diverge with the son of david solomon and nathan the second be why be any genealogy of joseph relavent at all if joseph have nothing to do with it if joseph wa not jesu physical father then the original poster be quite correct that claim for jesu messianic heritage be not base on truth but only on appearance whatever jesu divine nature wa the second problem be easy in my mind we assume that joseph wa not involve in the conception of jesu in any way however a holy spirit capable of work a physical conception in mary be also capable of employ the physical agency of joseph seed in thi work in my materialistic time we interpret viginity and it los solely in term of a physical act wherea it be really a matter of purity on a much higher level a well the important thing be that neither mary nor joseph wa consciou of any union between them they have not know each other thu the first gospel dedication of half it open chapter to the genealogy of joseph be quite relevant to jesu the virgin birth not withstand to the first question there be an answer that create to begin with more problem than it resolf it be that the two evangelist be relate the birth of two entirely different child of two entirely different set of parent except for the name of the parent and the child and the birthplace in bethlehem there be no point in common between the two story matthew and luke converge in their account only thirty year later with the baptism of jesu in jordan rudolf steiner offer hi explanation of how these account begin with two child and then converge with their account of the one jesu of nazareth he do not derive hi resolution from biblical study or speculation or from other external document and the discussion of how thi could be might bring u beyond the limit of appropriatenes for thi newsgroup in any case the detail be describe in steiner the spiritual guidance of the human being and of humanity the gospel of st luke and the gospel of st matthew whether or not rudolf steiner method and explanation be accept a valid at least thi interpretation resolf the apparent contradiction of the two genealogy while leave the text intact a for the pass of one jewishnes through the mother thi wa never an issue with jesu no one ever question hi or mary jewishnes the issue of the genealogy ha to do with hi paternal line of descent from david the king gerry palo
