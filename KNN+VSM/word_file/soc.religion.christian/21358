from steve a ward subject re mormon temple mserv mail server write one thing i do understand be why be sacred should make the temple ritual secret on of the attribute of be sacred in thi case be that they should not be speak of in a common manner or trample under foot such a the lord name be today the ceremoney be perform in the temple because the temple ha be set aside a be a place we believe that the ceremoney can only be interpret correctly when they be view with the right spirit which in thi case be in the temple so from my point of view when they be bring out into the public they be be trample under foot because of misinterpretation and mock and it be therefore offensive to u please do not assume that because of my use of the word and that i an official spokesman for the ld church i be merely state what i believe be the general feel among u other feel free to disagree steve ward
