from alisonjw alison j wyld subject re homosexuality issue in christiani he be hop to pa a resolution that more or le state that we the member of the church agree to disagree on the issue admit that both side have honestly study the scripture and have the spirit lead them to different conclusion it work last year when the abortion issue threaten to do more or le the same thing and he be hopeful that the ga can foster a love and care attitude about person who disagree with their own view cliff slaughterbeck person would not be will to note that the church wa not will to live with thi kind of compromise with ordination of woman the one thing that will definitely prevent a person from become a presbyterian minister be if they indicate that they do accept ordination of woman the argument be that we ca have half the church not accept the leader of the other half maybe person will clh it might be interest for folk to know that the church of scotland also a presbyterian church manage to agree to disagree over woman ordination for year the reason wa that congregation be free to call whoever they wish and that minister and session choose elder if a congregation do not wish to have a woman they be not oblige to and if a session do not wish to they could not be force to note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part of the congregation be very important here thi year be the annivarsary of the disruption where the church split on that very issue they do get back together for almost year a couple of year ago on the anniversary of the allow of woman ordination the position wa change so that in theory all minister and elder must recognise that woman can be ordain in theory a minister who refuse to ordain a woman to hi session or refuse to work with a woman minister in presbytery could be discipline in practice thi ha not happen and i believe it be unlikely to happen my personal view be that the new legislation wa a mistake and that the permissive but not prescriptive legislation work very well we be go to start go round the homosexual debate at next year assembly at thi year a motion wa put to ban the bless of same-sex couple after an edinburgh minister do so my panel on doctrine be currently look at marriage and will report next year the matter will be consider and debate then hope thi be interest alison
