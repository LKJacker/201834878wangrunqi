from cpage carter c page subject re reason v revelation in article trajan stephen mcintyre write in article write i can only reply with what it say in timothy i not here to discount part of the bible rather i here only to discount the notion of revelation the author of timothy tell what he think wa the truth base on hi belief in god hi faith in jesu a the resurrect son and hi read of the old testament but again what have be reveal to him wa base on at best second-hand information give by friend and author who may not have give the whole truth or who may have exaggerate a bite first of all the original poster misquote the reference be from tim the author wa paul and hi revelation be anything but at best second-hand and be come about that a saul journey he wa approach damascu and suddenly a light from heaven flash around him and he fell to the grind and hear a voice say to him saul saul why be you persecute me and he say who art thou lord and he say i be jesu whom you be persecute act na paul receive revelation directly from the rise jesu pretty cool eh he become closely involve with the early church the leader of which be follower of jesu throughout hi ministry on earth now you may say the holy spirit reveal these thing unto him and we could go into that argument but you be hard-pressed to convince me that the holy spirit exist i agree i do believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exist please do complain about thi be circular i know it be but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural thi be why revelation be necessary to the author of the bible additionally what he ha write be again second-hand info if it be give by the spirit and still carry the chance it be not true the spirit be part of god how much closer to the source can you get the greek in timothy which be sometime translate a inspire by god literally mean god-breathed in other word god speak the actual word into the scripture many theologian and bible scholar dr jame boice be one that i can remember off-hand get quite annoy by the drynes and incompletenes of inspire by god the only way you would be able to escape thi notion of second-hand info be to have have the entire bible write by god himself and to tell the truth i study the bible extensively and have yet to hear of scholar who have put forth objective evidence show god a the first author of thi collection of book that what the verse take from timothy wa all about the continuity of a book write over a span of year by more than author from all walk of life be a testimony to the single authorship of god and a for reason read what it say in corinthian about human wisdom basically it say that human wisdom be useles when compare with what god ha write for my learn if you know of jesu a well a you know the bible you realize he reason out the law and the prophet for the common man what source to you claim to have discover which ha information of superior historicity to the bible certainly not josephu write or the write of the gnostic which be third century at the earliest and though some claim jesu wa he wa human with all of the human wisdom the apostle paul set out to criticize yet would you not embrace the idea that jesu wa wise jesu wa fully god a well that why i assert that he be wise i realise that you may not accept the authority of the bible thi be unfortunate to say the least because there be no other way of learn about god and christ and god purpose with the earth than read the bible and search out it truth for yourself for ymy information i wa raise without any knowledge of god by the time some of the faithful come to show me the word and share with me it truth i wa live happily and morally without acknowledge the existence of a supreme be i have though read the bible several time over in it entirety and have study it thoroughly it contain truth in it and i consider jesu to be one of the most moral of human be to have live in fact i darn-near idolize the guy but there no rational reason for me to except god existence please rethink thi last paragraph if there be no god which seem to be ymy current belief then jesu wa either a liar or a complete nut because not only do he assert that god exist but he claim to be god himself regard to lewi how then could you have the least bite of respect for jesu in conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypothesis base on gut feel about the text and other scholar unsubstantiated claim the bible plead that we take it in it entirety or throw the whole book out about ymy read of the bible not only do the spirit inspire the writer but he guide the reader a well we can not understand it in the least without the spirit guidance for to u god reveal them through the spirit for the spirit search all thing even the depth of god cor na peace and may god guide u in wisdom carter c page of happiness the crown and chiefest part be wisdom a carpenter apprentice and to hold god in awe thi be the law that cpage see the stricken heart of pride bring down we learn when we be old adapted from sophocle other theologian get quite annoy at the mislead of god-breathed it true that the greek word ha a it root god and breath however etymology do necessarily tell you what a word mean otherwise goodbye would be a religiou expression since it come from god be with ye you have to look at how the word wa actually use in thi case the word be use for wisdom or dream that come from god but god-breathed be an overtranslation clh
