lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousnes proverb for the lord knoweth the way of the righteou but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm q but i be not wicked i be a decent moral person surely the good i have do in my life far outweigh whatever bad i have do how can these verse apply to me a by god standard of righteousnes even the most moral person be look upon by god a a desperate sinner on hi way to hell the bible teach that no one be good enough in himself to go to heaven on the contrary we be all sinner and we be all guilty before god a it be write there be none righteou no not one there be none that understandeth there be none that seeketh after god roman the heart be deceitful above all thing and desperately wicked who can know it jeremiah q if i be such a wicked person in god sight what will god do to me a the bible teach that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place call hell for a fire be kindle in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundation of the mountain i will heap mischief upon them i will spend mine arrow upon them they shall be burn with hunger and devour with burn heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the tooth of beast upon them with the poison of serpent of the dust deuteronomy q oh come on now hell be not real be it surely thing be not that bad a indeed hell be very real and thing be that bad for the individ ual who do not know the lord jesu christ a savior the bible make many reference to hell indicate that it be both eternal and consist of perpetual suffer and whosoever wa not find write in the book of life wa cast into the lake of fire revelation so shall it be at the end of the world the angel shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wail and gnash of tooth matthew when the lord jesu shall be reveal from heaven with hi mighty angel in flame fire take vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of my lord jesu christ who shall be punish with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of hi power thessalonian q that be terrible why would god create a hell a hell be terrible and it exist because god create man to be accountable to god for hi action god perfect justice demand payment for sin for the wage of sin be death roman for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the thing do in hi body accord to that he hath do whether it be good or bad corinthian but i say unto you that every idle word that man shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matthew q do that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be bring to life again to be judge and then to be send to hell a indeed it do that be unles we can find someone to be my substitute in bear the punishment of eternal damnation for my sin that someone be god himself who come to earth a jesu christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him all we like sheep have go astray we have turn every one to hi own way and the lord hath lay on him the iniquity of u all isaiah but he wa wound for my transgression he wa bruise for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace wa upon him and with hi stripe we be heal isaiah for i deliver unto you first of all that which i also receive how that christ die for my sin accord to the scripture and that he wa bury and that he rise again the third day accord to the scripture corinthian for he hath make him to be sin for u who know no sin that we might be make the righteousnes of god in him corinthian q are you say that if i trust in christ a my substitute who wa already punish for my sin then i will not have to worry about hell anymore a ye thi be so if i have believe in christ a my savior then it be a if i have already stand before the judgment throne of god christ a my substitute ha already pay for my sin he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him john q but what do it mean to believe on him if i agree with all that the bible say about christ a savior then be i save from go to hell a believing on christ mean a whole lot more than agree in my mind with the truth of the bible it mean that we hang my whole life on him it mean that we entrust every part of my life to the truth of the bible it mean that we turn away from my sin and serve christ a my lord no man can serve two master for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye can not serve god and mammon matthew repent ye therefore and be convert that ymy sin may be blot out when the time of refresh shall come from the presence of the lord act q are you say that there be no other way to escape hell except through jesu what about all the other religion will their follower also go to hell a ye indeed they can not escape the fact that god hold u account able for my sin god demand that we pay for my sin other religion can not provide a substitute to bear the sin of their follower christ be the only one who be able to bear my guilt and save u neither be there salvation in any other for there be none other name under heaven give among man whereby we must be save act jesu say i be the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john if we confes my sin he be faithful and just to forgive u my sin and to cleanse u from all unrighteousnes john q now i be desperate i do not want to go to hell what can i do a you must remember that god be the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether on the mercy of god a you see ymy hopeles condition a a sinner cry out to god to save you and the publican stand afar off would not lift up so much a hi eye unto heaven but smite upon hi breast say god be merciful to me a sinner luke sir what must i do to be save and they say believe on the lord jesu christ and thou shalt be save act q but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him a wonderfully god not only save u through the lord jesu but he also gife u the faith to believe on him you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesu christ a ymy savior for by grace be ye save through faith and that not of yourself it be the gift of god ephesian god work particularly through the bible to give u that faith so if you really mean busines with god about ymy salvation

then faith cometh by hear and hear by the word of god roman q but do thi mean that i have to surrender everything to god a ye god want u to come to him in total humility acknowledge my sinfulnes and my helplessnes trust totally in him the sacrifice of god be a break spirit a break and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise psalm because we be sinner we love my sin therefore we must begin to

lest any man should boast ephesian q what else will happen at the end of the world a those who have trust in jesu a their savior will be transform into their gloriou eternal body and will be with christ forever more for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which be alive and remain shall be catch up together with them in the cloud to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord thessalonian q what will happen to the earth at that time a god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heaven and a new earth where christ will reign with hi believer forever more but the day of the lord will come a a thief in the night in the which the heaven shall pa away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the work that be therein shall be burn up nevertheles we accord to hi promise look for new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousnes peter q do the bible give u any idea of when the end of the earth will come a ye the end will come when christ ha save all whom he plan to save and thi gospel of the kingdom shall be preach in all the world for a witnes unto all nation and then shall the end come matthew q can we know how close to the end of the world we might be a ye god gife much information in the bible concern the time of the history of the world and tell u that while the day of the lord will come a a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come a a thief for the believer there be much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very very close all the time clue in the bible point to thi for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them a travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape thessalonian surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth hi secret unto hi servant
