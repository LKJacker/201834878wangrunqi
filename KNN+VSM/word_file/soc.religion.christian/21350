from d andrew byler subject the nicene creed wa re major view of the trinity michael bushnell write the so-called creed of athanasiu however ha alway be a western creed and ha alway have the filioque the orthodox have say that they accept all that it say with the exception of the filioque but it be not in use which be exactly what i point out though i wa wrong about ymy use of the creed the catholic encylcopedium in which i read about it say the orthodox do use the creed minu the filioque apparently that ha change the athanasian creed ha alway have the filioque the nicene constantinopolitan do not of course the orthodox do not delete the filioque from the nicene creed it wa there to begin with but they certainly do from the athanasian creed which do have it from the begin i might point out that the whole problem start over the difference in way of explain the generation of the blessed trinity the east emphasize the idea of the holy spirit proceed from the father through the son and the west use proceed from the father and the son in fact some such a tertullian use both formulation see below following therefore the form of these example i profes that i do call god and hi word the father and and hi son two for the root and the stem be two thing but conjoin the fountain and the river be two kind but indivisible the sun and the ray be two form but coherent one anything which proceed from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceed but it be not on that account separate from it where there be second however there be two and where ther be third there be three the spirit then be third from god and the son just a the third from the root be the fruit of the stem and third from the fountain be the stream from the river and thrid from the sun be the apex of the ray tertullian against praxea about ad and i believe that the spirit proceed not otherwise than from the father through the son tertullian against praxea about ad and a st thoma show in hi summa theologica part question article and there be no contradiction between the two method of generation and in fact the two method of reckon the procession emphasize what st augustine among other teach that the holy spirit proceed from the father and the son but he proceed from the father in a more preeminent way for whatever the son ha he ha from the father certainly he ha it from the father that the holy spirit proceed from him for the father alone be not from another for which reason he alone be call unbegotten not indeed in the scripture but in the practice of theologian and of those who employ such term a they be able in a matter so great the son however be bear of the father and the holy spirit proceed principally from the father and since the father gife to the son all that he ha without any interval of time the holy spirit proceed jointly from both father and son he would be call son of the father and of the son if which be abhorent to everyone of sound mind they have both beget him the spirit wa not beget by each however but proceed from each and both st augustine of hippo the trinity to ad so in a sense all of the formulation be correct to the west at least because the holy spirit proceed from both father and son but in proceed from the son the orgin of that procession be the procession from the father so the holy spirit be proceed from the father through the son but a all that the son ha be from the father the holy spirit can be say to proceed from the father without any mention of the son be necessary in any case i be happy to know that i follow in the belief of pope st leo i st fulgence of ruspe st cyril of alexandrium pope st damsu i st augustine of hippo st epiphaniu of salami st ambrose of milan st hilary of poitier tertullian and other among the father who all have very quotable quote support the catholic position which i enunciate above a for the issue of the adoption of another creed be forbid i will point out that the holy father of ephesu and chalcedon both speak of the creed of nicea in their statement forbid anyone to produce write or compose a confession of faith other than the one define by the father of nicea that creed be a different creed than that of constantinople which be commonly call the nicene creed not of course in that they be condemn the adoption of the constantinopolitan creed which be but an enlargement upon the creed of nicea but that they be condemn the impiou opinion of nestoriou who have adopt a radically different creed from the one use by the church which among other thing deny the procession of the holy spirit form the son thu the addition of the constantinopolitan creed be not think to be in violation of thi and a the council chalcedon also affirm the doctrine of the procession of the holy spirit from the son which nestoriu deny they could hardly have be against explain in a fuller way the creed for they themself approve of previou addition to it and if the further explanation of the creed make in constantinople be not denigrate of the work do by the holy father of nicea or in any way heretical it follow that the council of toledo wa fully able to add what wa not dispute by the faithful to the creed so a to combat the impiety of the arian in spain because the filioque wa not in dispute in the church until many year later under photiu and other and that the filioque wa not dispute i provide more quote below since the holy spirit when he be in u effect my be conform to god and he actually proceed from the father and son it be abundantly clear that he be of the divine essence in it in essence and proceed from it st cyril of alexandrium the treasury of the holy and consubstantial trinity thesi ad the holy spirit be not of the father only or of the son only but he be the spirit of the father and the son for it be write if anyone love the world the spirit of the father be not in him and again it be write if anyone however do not have the spirit of christ he be none of hi when the father and the son be name in thi way the holy spirit be understand of whom the son himself say in the gospel that the holy spirit proceed from the father and that he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you pope st damasu i the decree of damasu ad the only-begotten holy spirit ha neither the name of the son nor the appelation of father but be call holy spirit and be not foreign to the father for the only-begotten himself call him the spirit of the father and say of him the he proceed from the father and will receive of mine so that he be reckon a not be foreign to the son but be of their same substance of the same godhead he be spirit divine of god and he be god for he be spirit of god spirit of the father and spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesi like soul and body in u but in the midst of father and son of the father and of the son a third by appelation the father alway exist and the son alway exist and the spirit breathe from the father and the son and neither be the son create nor be the spirit create st epiphaniu of salami which be on cypru the man well-anchored and ad concerning the holy spirit i ought not to remain silent nor yet be it necessary to speak still on account of those who do not know him it be not possible for me to be silent however it be necessary to speak of him who must be acknowledge who be from the father and the son hi source st hilary of poitier the trintiy to ad thu a i have point out before gaul spain italy africa egypt palastine and the land of the greek all of christnedom at that time all have father who can be cite to show that they confes the doctrine express by the filioque i suggest to those of the orthodox church that they come up with some of the father beside st john of damascu who all will admit deny the filioque to support their view it be not enough to bring up the proceed from the father line of the creed or the gospel of john for that say what we believe also but it do not say the holy spirit do not proceed from the son only that he do proceed from the father andy byler
