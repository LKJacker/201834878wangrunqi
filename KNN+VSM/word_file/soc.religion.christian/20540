from jodfishe joseph dale fisher subject re unity in article maarten van loon write hello fellow-netter and fellow christian about the subject of unity between christian and christian church to a bible study group alltough i do have a personal opinion on thi issue i think it would be nice to hear opinion of fellow christian brother and sister from different country and in different situation my background member of a orthodox reformed church let u say a little the only unity i find which be true be when all party involve be disciple i come out of a church in which even the different congregation be alway compete and argue about which one wa better and who have the better message while none of them put anything into practice from those message since become a disciple i find that when i travel to another church in the same movement they be just a accept there a any other we have a retreat back in january when some of the congregation from louisville ky come up thi retreat wa for college student and it wa a though i have know even the person from louisville for year and i have only become a disciple the previou april and have never be to the church in kentucky one of the key to unity be unselfish love and self-sacrifice that be only one area in which disciple stand out from christian also another part of unity be a common depth of conviction i also be a part of some christian campu fellowship who be focus on unity between church and saw that those church have one thing involve a lack of conviction about everything they believe that wa why they could be unify they do care about the truth but delight in get along together the problem here in the netherland be that there be two other church denomination with the same characteristic both have the same confession there be only some difference with respect to for example the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use my creed in essence a lot of person of these three church have to same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that be the question creed what need be there of creed when the bible stand firmly better so here be a first question can the congregation of christ be separate by wall of different denomination or be thi definitely an untolerable situation accord to the scripture according to the scripture split and difference of opinion be go to be there a per a previou note i mention that there be those who teach falsely by many mean there be also difference of opinion and belief however scripture state in the follow directive i have no praise for you for ymy meet do more harm than good in the first place i hear that when you come together a a church there re division among you and to some extent i believe it no doubt there have to be difference among you to show which of you have god approval corinthian how will god show hi approval by fruitfulnes see act but before that there be these quality devotion to the apostle teach fellowship communion fill with awe for god all have everything in common glad and sincere heart praise god enjoy the favor of the person all these be mention in act god also show that those who have these quality be persecute look at stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit act who wa later stone act can one say that only one of these three church be the true church of jesu christ one can say that a church be the true church only if that church be perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide a a movement i have yet to find that but the closest one i find be the boston church of christ movement which constantly strife to have error point out and correct it be also the only one i see which be totally sell out to god a problem closely relate to these question be can we cooperate with other christian from these two church before there be a unity thi question be especially important for those who think that only one church can be the true one a for cooperation that can alway occur unity on the other hand may never occur a for those who think about only one church be the true one i remind them that mark state that there be disciple who be not a part of the main group to begin with but they will not lose their reward a with the boston movement i hear numerou time thi exact same thing that there be disciple out there that be not a part of the boston movement but that do not make them any le disciple of course few person admit that they ever run into someone who ha the quality of a disciple outside the movement i know i have maybe thi last problem sound a little strange to most of you for ymy information we have a lot of organization here which be found by person of one specific church and whose member be all member of that church thi ha be consider a correct for year only a few year ago person start to discus about thi and now we be in the middle of thi proces some organization be open their door for person from other church etc i must warn that thi sound cliquey to me a clique be a group which run around together to some extent exclusively thi cause problem in fellowship and cause division i would not say at all that thi be something correct for a to do for any reason in one of the church i attend for example there wa an internal clique of person who be on the different head of the congregation they rarely talk to anyone else outside of the committee and seldom be vote out of office without another office be open up so that they would have to step right back in their degree of exclusion wa such that when the new pastor come he nearly have to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he would since they still have no clue about what it mean to be a disciple anyway thi rigidity in the clique be begin to be break down but be still there so i must warn against such division within there enough division without thank for ymy opinion in advance maarten joe fisher
