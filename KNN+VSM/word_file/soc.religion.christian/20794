from noye vera shantus noye subject re when be two person marry in god eye i have a question for you all relate to thi jesu condemn divorce several time in the new testament and i have a hard time with thi the catholic church a far a i can tell do grant annulment with the statement that the marriage never really exist in god eye please if i be mistinterpreting correct me however i have witness marriage where two person be very much in love but recognize that they be destroy themself and each other by stay in a marriage and that the problem be due to personal childhood issue that have never be resolve i ask you be divorce justify in such a case they know who they be what they be do they be deeply in love but in the end it do not work out i must admit that i do see jesu force them to live together or even condemn that they go and seek happiness with someone else later on opinion vera i be ymy clock i bind unto myself today vera noye i be ymy religion the strong name of the noye i own you trinity no disclaimer what lard st patrick breastplate be there to disclaim thi be a commonly discuss question though it be long enough that i allow it to be ask a you might expect there be a range of answer catholic and some other will say that divorce be never justify by the way in situation where someone be be abuse or for other seriou cause separation be allow by all tradition that i know no one should be force to stay in a situation where they be in danger other see it a a last resort in situation that have fall apart badly enough that the best we can hope for be to choose the lesser of evil in some sense the difficult legal question turn out not to be divorce but remarriage that because of jesu statement in mark and par a with so many other thing thi turn on ymy approach to the bible conservative protestant tend to see statement like thi a have no exception more liberal one be will to make allowance for situation where a literal interpretation would lead to painful result it be note that at the time it wa possible for a man to divorce hi wife almost on a whim thu a common explanation in the more liberal approach be that jesu wa try to protect person from thi sort of thing not to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be exception catholic a be typical with catholic ethic take a theoretical hard line but allow for exception in practice through the proces of anullment in the last discussion most of my non-catholic reader seem to accept with some reluctance that in some case there might be no good alternative but there wa a feel that the church should often be do a better job of help person prepare for marriage and deal with problem that come up during it and that in a properly run church divorce should not be necessary clh
