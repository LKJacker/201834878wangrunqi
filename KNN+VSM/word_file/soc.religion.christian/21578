from djohnson darin johnson subject re homosexuality issue in christianity any attempt to make homosexual feel unwelcome because of my discomfort with homosexuality be incompatible with christianity is my hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to jesu we need to keep them away thi be too often true many person try to place thi a a higher sin however do jesu need u to screen out those guilty of a particular sin do we really mistrust jesu when he say he can forgive any sin a big part of the problem be that many of the homosexual and person advocate acceptance of homosexuality in church do not consider active homosexuality a sin i do often see the attitude of forgive me and i will try to change instead i see there nothing wrong with my life and i can be a good christian so it must be you who have an illnes because you do accept me christian can and will accept homosexual just a they will accept any sinner sure it may be natural to some person to be homosexual but it be also perfectly natural for everyone to sin i wa bear with a desire to sin but i work to prevent myself from sin it much le common now but i still have urge to lash out in anger there also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful desire or ever so it be sad to see person leave the church when they be discourage that they be still homosexual after several year darin johnson djohnson particle man particle man do the thing a particle can
