from ml michael siemon subject ero in lxx conclude lexicographic note thi might be better direct to which i have begin read but since my earlier note be post to thi forum i will conclude here a well a week ago i manage to find time to consult a septuagint concordance and a lxx text with apparatu at the library and i can now usefully conclude my look at the greek word for love a use in the christian background of the septuagintal translation of the jewish scripture the principal result be that there be a cluster of use of the verbal noun from erao eraste s mean lover thi cluster occur just where one might most expect it in the propethic image and accusation of israel a faithles spouse to yhwh the verse in question be hosea jeremiah lamentation and ezekiel and hosea seem to have originate thi usage which jeremiah and ezekiel pick up lamentation be dependent on though not likely write by jeremiah the erotic mean in it allegorical use not at all literally be evident so too in english unles you complement it with a phrase like of the art the word lover be go to have an overtone of sexual relationship there be no surprise here but it be worthwhile to see that standard greek usage do show up in the translation from the hebrew more interestingly and some confirmation of my gues that later koine usage avoid the verb erao because of it homonymy to ero say eromai ask there be an error in codex vaticanu normally a very valuable witnes where a form of erao be use in a completely absurd context samuel where the mean must be say in addition to the above and the use i have already mention in proverb esther use the verb in it most natural application kai e rasthe ho basileu esthe r and the king love esther and rather more interestingly samuel supply a modest degree of support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of david and jonathan kai io nathan huio saoul e i reito ton dauid sphodra and jonathan saul son love david intensely i use the bracket i for io tum subscript which i do yet have a reasonable ascius convention for the relevance of thi to the gay issue be not anything implicit about the historical fact but just that a quasi-official translation of the hebrew text in the hellenistic period make no bone about use the erotic verb in thi context given the quite general usage of agapao for erotic sense thi need not mean anything more than agapao alone would mean but it do disambiguate the relationship a far a thi translator go michael l siemon i say you be god son of the ml most high all of you nevertheles or you shall die like man and fall ml like any prince psalm
