from michael d walker subject new think on deuterocanonical often time most recently on thi list in the last few day i hear the passage from revelation whoever add to the sacred word of thi book whoever remove word from thi book use a an arguement against the deutercanonical book i feel thi be ridiculou for two reason they be add later by the catholic church they be alway part of what wa consider inspire scripture thi ha be deal with in previou post no reason to repeat the info it be more likely than not that when st john or whomever write the book of revelation what wa then considered scripture wa not the same thing you and i be hold in my hand if one take the translation of thi book in rev or somewhere around there to mean all of scripture then all of u be likely hold something that be in violation of thi command it be impossible to exactly date the scripture even the one they do like to date their letter i gues i really wish i have my bible with me right now to get the fact straight but i believe that several of the letter chief among them peter have their most likely date of composition in the early second century revelation wa almost certainly write durin the reign of domition sp thu it could be argue that we be all in sin if we accept peter a scripture since it wa add to the book after the composition of revelation when we be tell to add nothing more if you want to get the exact date get a copy of the new american bible i try to follow thi up tomorrow if i remember mike walker univ of illinoi
