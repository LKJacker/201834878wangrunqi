from jhpb joseph h buehler subject re sspx schism larry l overacker write respond to simon i may be interest to see some brief selection post to the net my understand be that sspx do not consider itself in schism or legitimately excommunicate but that really beside the point what do the roman catholic church say excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication a provide for in canon law here some of the theology involve for the interest there be confusion over thi issue of the sspx schism often the basic problem be lack of an ability to distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schism take the variou classification of obedience first there be important element involve here for my purpose a command the response make to the command a far a the command go command can be legitimate such a the pope order catholic to not eat meat on friday or they can be illegitimate such a the pope order catholic to worship the god dagon when every other full moon come around a far a the response to a command go it can be to refuse to do what be command or to comply making a table there be thu possibilite command response name legitimate comply true obedience illegitimate refuse true obedience legitimate refuse disobedience illegitimate comply false obedience so now you see where my classification of obedience come from obedience be not solely a matter of the nature of the command must also be take into account it be not enough to consider someone compliance or refusal and then say whether they be obedient or disobedient you also have to take into consideration whether the command be good or bad in my example if the pope command all catholic to worship the god dagon and they all refuse they be be disobedient at all a far a the society of saint piu x go they be certainly refuse to comply with certain thing the pope desire but that alone be insufficient to allow one to label them disobedient you also have to consider the nature of the papal desire and there the rub sspx say the pope since vatican ius have be command certain very bad thing for the church the pope have of course disagree so where be we are we in another arian heresy complete with weak pope or be the sspx priest modern martin luther well the only way to answer that be to examine who be say what and what the traditional teach of the church be the problem here be that very few catholic have much of an idea of what be really go on and what the issue be the religion of american catholic be especially defective in intellectual depth you will never read about the issue be discuss in the catholic pres in thi country on the other hand one italian catholic magazine i get day ha have interview with the superior general of the society of saint piu x many catholic will decide to side with the pope there be some soundnes in thi because the papacy be infallible so eventually some pope will straighten all thi out but on the other hand there be also unsoundnes in thi in that in the short term the pope may indeed be wrong and such catholic be do nothing to help the situation by obey them where they wrong in fact if the situation be grave enough they sin in obey him at the very least they waste a great opportunity because they be fail to love christ in a heroic way at the very time that he need thi badly schism let move on to schism what be it schism be a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command all schismatic be disobedient but it a superset so it do work the other way around not all disobeyer be schismatic the mere fact that the sspx priest do comply with the holy father desire do make them schismatic so what be it that must be add to disobedience to constitute a schism maybe thi something else make the sspx priest schismatic you must add thi the rejection of the right to command look in any decent reference on catholic theology and that what you find the distinguish criterion of schism be rejection of the right to command here what the catholic encyclopedium say for example not every disobedience be a schism in order to posse thi character it must include beside the trangression of the command of superior denial of their divine right to command from the ce article schism is the society of saint piu x then schismatic the answer be a clear no they say that the pope be their bos they pray for him every day and that all that matter a far a schism go what all thi boil down to be thi if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objection their position be a legitimate one a far a the catholic theology of obedience and schism go they be resist certain papal policy because they think that they be clearly contrary to the traditional teach of the papacy and the best interest of the church in fact someone who find himself in thi situation ha a duty to resist now what be the stance of rome on all thi well if you read the holy father motu proprio ecclesium dei you can find out it the definitive document on the subject a motu proprio be a specifically papal act it not the product of a roman congregation a letter that the pope ha possibly never even read it from the pope himself hi bos be god there no one else to complain to in thi document the holy father say among other thing the episcopal consecration perform by archbishop lefebvre constitute a schismatic act archbishop lefebvre problem wa a misunderstand of the nature of tradtion both be confuse i fail to see the logic of the pope point a far a the episcopal consecration go i read an interest article in a translation of the italian magazine si si no no it all get back to the question of jurisdiction if episcopal consecration imply rejection of the pope jurisdiction then they would truly constitute a schismatic act justify excommunication under the current code of canon law but my problem with thi be thi accord to the traditional theology of holy order episcopal consecration do not confer jurisdiction it only confer the power of order the ability to confect the sacrament jurisdiction must be confer by someone else with the power to confer it such a the pope the society bishop know the traditional theology quite well take great pain to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacrament that require a bishop the si si no no article wa interest in that it posit that the reason that the pope say what he do be that he ha a novel post-vatican ius idea of holy order according to thi idea episcopal consecration do confer jurisdiction i lend the article to a friend unfortunately so ca tell you more i believe they quote the new code of canon law in support of thi idea the pope think on thi point remain a great puzzle to me there no way there be a schism accord to traditional catholic theology so why do the pope think thi a far a the point regard the nature of tradition go here the passage in question the root of thi schismatic act can be discern in an incomplete and contradictory notion of tradtion incomplete because it do not take sufficiently into the account the live character of tradition which a the second vatican council clearly teach come from the apostle and progress in the church with the help of the holy spirit there be a growth in insight into the reality and word that be be pass on thi come about in variou way it come through the contemplation and study of believer who ponder these thing in their heart it come from the intimate sense of spiritual reality which they experience and it come from the preach of those who have receive along with their right of succession in the espiscopate the sure charism of truth but especially contradictory be a notion of tradition which oppose the universal magisterium of the church possess by the bishop of rome and the body of bishop it be impossible to remain faithful to the tradition while break the ecclesial bond with him to whom in the person of the apostle peter christ himself entrust the ministry of unity in hi church papal motu proprio ecclesium dei july it seem to me that the holy father be make two point here that can be simplify to the follow vatican council ius ha happen i be the pope the argument be that either case be sufficient to prove that archbishop lefebvre must be wrong because he disagree with them thi be weak to say the least it would have help clarify thing more if the pope have address archbishop lefebvre concern in detail what be john paul ius stand on the social kingship of christ a teach by gregory xvus piu ix leo xiius piu xi and piu xius for example are we suppose to ignore what all these pope say on the subject i do know what the future will hold but the power that be in the sspx be still talk with rome and try to straighten thing out many person would prefer to call a justify refusal to obey justify disobedience or even obey god rather than man calling a refusal to obey obedience put u into a sort of alouse in wonderland world where word mean whatever we want them to mean similarly schism indicate a formal break in the church if the pope say that a schism exist it seem to me that by definition it exist it may be that the pope be on the wrong side of the break that there be no good reason for the break to exist and that it will shortly be heal but how can one deny that it do in fact exist it seem to me that you be in grave danger of destroy the thing you be try to reform the power of the papacy what good will it do you if you become reconcile to the the pope in the future but in the proces you have destroy hi ability to use the tool of church discipline it one thing to hold that the pope ha misuse hi power and excommunicate someone wrongly it something else to say that hi excommunication do not take effect and the schism be all in hi imagination that mean that act of church discipline be not legal tool but act whose validity be open to debate generally it ha be liberal catholic who have have problem with the pope while they have often object to church sanction generally they have admit that the sanction exist you be now open the door to person simply ignore papal decision claim to be truly obey by disobey and to be in communion while excommunicate thi would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to command that you say define schism clh
