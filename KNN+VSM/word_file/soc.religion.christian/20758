from frank decenso jr subject major view of the trinity with frank permission i have add some information here and in one case change the order of hi contribution in order to clarify the historical relationship of the view my comment be base primarily on william rusch historical summary in the trinitarian controversy fortres i go to save thi a an faq clh major view of the trinity second century the writer of the cent be important because they set up much of the context for the later discussion justin martyr aristide athenagora tatian and theophilu of antioch be know a the apologist their theology ha often be describe a logo theology based strongly on word in john they take more or le a two-phase approach through eternity the logo wa with the father a hi mind or think thi immanent word become express a god reveal himself in history ultimately in jesu thu jesu full distinction from the father only become visible in history though the logo have be present in god from eternity rusch regard thi view be contain many of the emphase of the final orthodox position but in a form which be le sophisticate because it do not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the godhead irenaeu hold view somewhat similar to the apologist however he wa uncomfortable with the two-stage approach he still view god a one personage with distinction that do not become fully visible except through hi proces of self-revelation the economy the distinction be present in hi essential nature irenaeu emphasize the holy spirit more than the apologist irenaeu view should probably be call economic trinitarianism though that term be normally use a below to refer to later development third century clh dynamic monarchianism source theodotu adherent paul of samosotum artemon socinu modern unitarian perception of god essence the unity of god denote both onenes of nature and onenes of person the son and the holy spirit therefore be consubstantial with the father divine essence only a impersonal attribute the divine dunami come upon the man jesu but he wa not god in the strict sense of the word perception of god subsistence the notion of a subsistent god be a palpable impossibility since hi perfect unity be perfectly indivisible the of god be apparent and not real since the christ event and the work of the holy spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within god not to a hypostatic union asignation of father unique originator of the universe he be eternal self-existent and without begin or end son a virtuou but finite man in whose life god wa dynamically present in a unique way christ definitely wa not deity though hi humanity wa deify holy spirit an impersonal attribute of the godhead no deity or eternality be ascribe to the holy spirit criticism s elevate reason above the witnes of biblical revelation concern the trinity categorically deny the deity of christ and of the holy spirit thereby undermine the theological undergird for the biblical doctrine of salvation in summary thi probably best think of a not be trinitarianism at all god be an undifferentiated one son and holy spirit be see a simply name for the man jesu and the grace of god active in the church clh modalistic monarchianism source praxea adherent noatu sabelliu swedenborg scleiermacher united pentecostal jesu only perception of god essence the unity of god be ultra-simplex he be qualitatively characterize in hi essence by one nature and person thi essence may be designate interchangeably a father son and holy spirit they be different name for but identical with the unify simplex god the three name be the three mode by which god reveal himself perception of god subsistence the concept of a subsistent god be erroneou and confound the real issue of the phenomenon of god modalistic manifest of himself the paradox of a subsist three in onenes be refute by recognize that god be not three person but one person with three different name and correspond role follow one another like part of a drama asignation of father fully god and fully eternal a the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary god son full ascribe only in the sense of hi be another mode of the one god and identical with hi essence he be the same god manifest in temporal sequence specific to a role incarnation holy spirit eternal god only a the tile designate the phase in which the one god in temporal sequence manifest himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification criticism s depersonalize the godhead to compensate for it trinitarian deficiency thi view propound idea that be clearly heretical it concept of successive manifestation of the godhead can not account for such simultaneou appearance of the three person a at christ baptism rusch comment that evidence on these belief be sketchy there be actually two slightly different group include noetu and hi follower and sabelliu noetu wa apparently more extreme sabelliu follow him and attempt to use some feature of economic trinitarianism to create a more sophisticate view unfortunately information about sabelliu come from a century later and there seem to be some confusion between him and marcellu of ancyra clh i move the follow description to be with the other third-century view it originally appear near the end clh economic trinitarianism source hippolytu tertullian adherent variou neo-economic trinitarian perception of god essence the godhead be characterize by triunity father son and holy spirit be the three manifestation of one identical indivisible substance the perfect unity and consubstantiality be especially comprehend in such manifest triadic deed a creation and redemption perception of god subsistence subsistence within the godhead be articulate by mean of such term a distinction and distribution dispel effectively the notion of separatenes or division asignation of the equal deity of father son and holy spirit be clearly elucidate in observation of the simultaneou feature of the godhead co-eternality at time do not intelligibly surface in thi ambiguou view but it seem to be a logical implication criticism s is more tentative and ambiguou in it treatment of the relational aspect of the trinity note that thi be a development of the apologist and irenaeu a mention above a with them the threenes be visible primarily in the variou way that god reveal himself in history however they do say that thi be a manifestation of a plurality that be somehow present in the godhead from the begin tertullian talk of the father son and holy spirit a be three that be one in substance many person regard thi view a be essentially orthodox but with le develop philosophical category clh origen develop further an approach start by clement attempt to apply neo-platonism to christian think he set many of the term of the come battle in platonic fashion he see the son a a mediator mediate between the absolute one of god and the plurality of create be the son be generate but he be eternally generate that be the relationship between father and son be eternal it can not be say that there wa once when he wa not a phrase that will haunt the discussion for century having the son be intrinsic to hi concept of god the father and son be describe a separate hypostase though thi may not have quite the mean of separate subsistence that it have in some context the union be one of love and action but there be some reason to think that he may have use the term homoousio of the same substance the holy spirit be also an active personal substance originate by the father through the son origen intent be trinitarian not tritheistic but he push thing in the direction of separatenes fourth century clh subordinationism often call arianism clh source ariu major adherent modern jehovah witness and several other lesser know cult perception of god essence the inherent onenes of god nature be properly identifiable with the father only the son and the holy spirit be discreet entity who do not share the divine essence perception of god subsistence the unipersonal essence of god preclude the concept of divine subsistence with a godhead threenes in onenes be self contradictory and violate biblical principle of a monotheistic god asignation of father the only one unbegotten god who be eternal and without begin son a create be and therefore not eternal though he be to be venerate he be not of the divine essence holy spirit a nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the father he be view a an influence an expression of god deity be not ascribe to him criticism s it be at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respect the deity of both christ and the holy spirit it hierarchial concept likewise assert three essentially separate person with regard to the father christ and the holy spirit thi result in a totally confuse soteriology note also that in most version of thi view the son be not fully human either he be supernatural and sinles that distinguish thi view from adoptionism clh orthodox trinitarianism source athanasiu adherent basil gregory of nyssa gregory of nazianzu augustine thoma aquina luther calvin contemporary orthodox christianity perception of god essence god be be perfectly unify and simplex of one essence thi essence of deity be hold in common by father son and holy spirit the three person be consubstantial coinherent co-equal and co eternal perception of god subsistence the divine subsistence be say to occur in three mode of be or hypostase a such the godhead exist undivided in divide person thi view contemplate an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinction of person in the godhead asignation of in it final distillation thi view unhesitatingly set forth father son and holy spirit a co-equal and co-eternal in the godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function criticism s the only shortcoming ha to do with the limitation inherent in human language and think itself the impossibility of totally describe the ineffable mystery of three in onenes at least in the cent there be several different approach all of which fit the description here and all regard a orthodox but which be somewhat different in detail nicea wa originally hold to respond to ariu ariu can be think of a carry origen think a bite too far to the point of make the son a separate entity in general the east tend to take an approach base on origen and it wa hard to get acceptance of nicea in the east it final acceptance wa base on the work of athanasiu with the cappadocian gregory of nyssa and gregory of nazianzu among other while start with three they show that their unity in nature and and action be such that one must think of them a be a single god thi allow the council of constantinople in to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousium clh adapted from chart of christian theology and
