from crep stephen a crep subject re what wa the immaculate conception in article seanna seanna watson write i have quite a problem with the idea that mary never commit a sin wa mary fully human if it be possible for god to miraculously make a person free of original sin and free of commit sin their whole life then what be the purpose of the incarnation of jesu why ca god just repeat the miracle do for mary to make all the rest of u sinles without the need for repentance and salvation and all that ye mary be fully human however that do not imply that she wa just a subject to sin a we be catholic doctrine say that man nature be good gen but be damage by original sin rom in that case be undamaged by original sin mary be more fully human than any of the rest of u you ask why god can not repeat the miracle of mary preservation from original sin a better way to phrase it would be why do he not do it that way but you misunderstand how mary salvation wa obtain like our the blessed virgin mary salvation wa obtain through the merit of the sacrifice of christ on the cros however a god be not bind by time which be hi creation god be free to apply hi sacrifice to anyone at any time even if that person live before christ come to earth from my time-bound perspective therefore christ death and resurrection still serve a necessary purpose and be necessary even for mary salvation steve crep indiana university crep
