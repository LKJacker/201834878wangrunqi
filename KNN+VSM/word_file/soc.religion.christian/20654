from jodfishe joseph dale fisher subject re eternity of hell wa re hell in article dlecoint write insert deletion of unnecessary quote why be it that we have thi notion that god take some sort of pleasure from punish person the purpose of hell be to destroy the devil and hi angel first of all god do not take any sort of pleasure from punish person he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion ex however if he enjoy punish person and send them to hell then why would he send jesu to seek and save that which wa lose luke to the earlier poster who try to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fall angel be not destroy remember the bible teach that god ha reserve them until the day of judgement their judgement be soon to come let me suggest thi maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it stay away from human theory and only take into account reference in the bible you ask for it peter talk about how those who be ungodly be punish matthew be also very clear that those who do not righteou in god eye will be send to hell for eternity thessalonian state that those who cause trouble for the disciple will be punish with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord thessalonian talk about those who refuse to love the truth be condemn revelation talk about the difference between those who overcome and those who do not those who do not list in verse will be in the fiery lake of burn sulfur revelation gife the indication that those who follow the beast will be torment with burn sulfur and there be no rest day or night for them because of it psalm the wicked return to the grave all the nation that forget god i think those should be sufficient to prove the point dariu joe fisher in the follow i mostly play devil advocate i not advocate either position my concern be that person understand that it possible to see these passage in different way it possible to see eternal destruction a just that destruction rev often use the term second death the most obviou understand of that would seem to be final extinction the problem be that the nt speak both of eternal punishment and of second death it use term that can be understand either way my concern here be not to convince you of one view or the other but to help person understand that there a wide enough variety of image that it possible to understand them either way a tom albrecht comment the primary point be to do my best to keep person out of the eternal fire whatever the detail to make thing more interest luke imply that the damn do get resurrect at all presumably they just stay dead ye i aware that it possible to understand thi passage in a non-literal way peter be talk about angel and talk about hold them in hell until the final judgement thi be eternal punishement matthew talk about send the curse into eternal fire prepare for the devil and hi angel the fact that the fire be eternal do mean that person will last in it flame forever particularly interest be the comment about the fire have be prepare for the devil and hi angel rev and talk about the eternal fire a well they say that the beast and the false prophet will be torment forever in it when talk about person be throw into it it be refer to a the second death thi sound more like extinction than eternal torment is be possible that the fire ha different effect on supernatural entity such a the devil and human thessalonian similarly what be everlasting destruction thi be not necessarily eternal torment thi one can clearly be understand either way but i think it at least possible to think that everlasting be be use to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in thi life with the final destruction that occur in eternity thessalonian again talk about destruction revelation see comment above revelation be probably the best of the quote even there it do explicitly say that the person suffer forever it say that the smoke and presumably the fire be eternal and that there be no respite from it but it do say that the person be torment forever psalm i do see that it say anything relevant to thi issue clh
