from jhpb joseph h buehler subject re sspx schism in article shellgate llo larry l overacker write you ask where we be i would echo that question i not try to be contentiou but assume that the pope ha universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for ymy decision what prevent me from choose any doctrine i like and say that papal disagreement be an error that will be resolve in time thi be especially true since council of bishop have basically stand by the pope the ultimate question be the traditional theology of the church thi be the only thing that it be possible to resist a pope for hi departure from the traditional doctrine of the church if command from any authority conflict with tradition the command must be disobey my own view on thi be that thi conflict could only happen in a major way god would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop it would be too complex for person to figure out i do view the present situation in the church a anything extremely complicate run through a list of what ha happen in the last year in the catholic church and any impartial observer will be aghast it appear that much of what ly at the heart of thi matter be disagreement over what be tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline the problem stem from a general widespread ignorance of the catholic faith in my opinion most catholic know about zilch about the catholic faith thi leaf them wide open for destruction by err bishop it basically the reformation part ius there be not even a question in my mind that in some respect the shard of the catholic church be currently be trample upon by the catholic hierarchy i could go on list shock thing for an hmy probably take the situation in campo brazil for example i read a book on what happen there after vatican council ius the bishop antonio de castro-mayer never introduce all the change that follow in the wake of vatican ius he keep the traditional mas the same old catechism etc he make sure the person know their faith the catholic theology of obedience what modernism wa etc he innoculated the person against what wa come well one day the order come from rome for hi retirement it come when the pope wa sick bishop de castro-mayer wait until the pope recover then inquire whether thi command wa what the pope really want or something that some liberal have command in hi absence the pope confirm the decision so the good bishop retire the injustice that follow wa completely incredible a new bishop wa instal he proceed to expel most of bishop de castro-mayer clergy from their church because they refuse to celebrate the new mas the new bishop would visit a parish and celebrate a new mas the person would promptly walk out of the church en masse the bishop wa enrage by thi he usually resort to enlist the help of the secular authority to eject the priest from the church the priest would just start build new church the person be completely behind them the old parish have the new mas a the bishop desire and virtually no parishioner the prime motivation for all thi wa completely illegal accord to canon law no priest can be penalize in any way for say the traditional mas because of legislation enact by pope saint piu v nor be there any obligation to say the new mas during all thi proces the person of campo not just private individual but include civil authority be constantly send petition and letter to rome to do something about the new modernist bishop nothing wa ever do no help ever arrive from rome eventually priest be kick out and about person my question to the supporter of sspx be thi is there any way that ymy position with respect to church reform could change and be conform to those of the pope assume that the pope position do not change and that the leader of sspx do jointly make such choice if not thi appear to be claim infallible teach authority if i adopt the view that i not wrong i ca be wrong and there no way i change my mind you must change your that i either leave the catholic church or it ha leave me if the pope define certain thing ex cathedra that would be the end of the controversy that proces be all very well understand in catholic theology and anyone who do go along with it be an instant non-catholic the problem here be that person do not appreciate what be go on in the catholic world if they know the faith and what my bishop be do they would be shock we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teach of the church be if thi be a simple matter east and west would not have be separate for over year thi be the case in the catholic church there be a massive body of traditional teach the pope of the last year be especially relevant there be no question at all what the traditional doctrine be i think that the teach magisterieum of the church do not allow error in teach regard faith and moral even in the short term i may be wrong here i not roman catholic that heresy more or le although they have do a great job since the reformation the last year have see so many error spread that it pitiful infallibility rest in the pope and in the church a a whole in the short term a pope or large section of the church can go astray in fact that what usually happen during a major heresy large section of the church go astray the pope historically ha be much more reliable everything will alway come back in the long run what would be the effect of a pope make an ex cathedra statement regard the sspx situation would it be honor if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again i not try to be contention i try to understand since i orthodox i get no real vest interest in the outcome one way or the other ye it would be honor infallibility be infallibility but what be he go to define that the new mas be a better expression of the catholic faith than the old that sex education in the catholic school be wonderful that all religion be wonderful except for that profess by the pope prior to vatican ius it do if the command wa legitimate sspx do not view the pope command a legitimate why thi be a very slippery slope not really start study the major catholic theologian of the last year everything be very well spell out the west excel at critical think remember that what catholic theologian have be busy at for century
