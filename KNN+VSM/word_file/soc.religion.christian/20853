from kilroy dr nancy sweetie subject re certainty and arrogance in an earlier article i explain that what many person find arrogant about christian be that some christian profes absolute certianty about their belief and doctrine that be many christian insist that they can not have make any mistake when discover their belief which amount to say that they be infallible impicitly claim to be infallible be pretty arrogant most of u will probably agree in short the problem be that no matter how good ymy source be if any part of ymy doctrine or belief rest on ymy own think and reason then those doctrine be suspect so long a ymy own brain be involve there be a possibility for error i summarise the problem by write there be no way out of the loop someone call rexlex ha claim that there is a way out of the loop but he do not bother to explain what it wa prefer instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument lead to relativism a i have explain to him before you can not reject an argument a false because you dislike where it lead the fact do not change just because you dislike them rexlex write i disagree with dr nancy sweetie conclusion because if it be take to fruition it lead to relativism which lead to dispair however a any first-year philosophy student can explain what rexlex ha write do not constitute a refutation all he ha say be that he do not like what i write he ha do nothing at all to dispute it there be two sentence in rexlex post that seem relevant to the point at hand there be such a thing a true truth and it be real it can be experience and it be verifiable i do not dispute that some truth can be verify through experience i have for example direct experience of add number i do claim to be infallible at it in fact i remember do sum incorrectly but i do claim that i have direct experience of reason about number however once we go past experience thing and start reason about them we be on much shakier grind that wa the point of the earlier article human brain be infest with sin and they can only be trust in very limit circumstance it be only because of god own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing but how far do that get you once god revelation stop and ymy own reason begin possibility for error appear for example let suppose that my modern bible translation include a perfect render of jesu word at the last supper and that jesu say exactly thi be my body we presume that what he say wa totally without error and absolutely true what can we be certain of not much at the moment he stop speak and person start interpret the possibility of error appear did he mean that literally or not we do not have any record that he elaborate on the word wa he think of tran or con substatiation he do say we interpret thi passage use my brain we think and reason and draw conclusion but we know that my brain be not perfect my think often lead u wrong thi be something that most of u have direct experience of why should anyone believe that hi reason which he know to be fallible can lead him to perfect conclusion so give the assumption in thi example what we can be certain of be that jesu say thi be my body beyond that once we start make up doctrine and use my brain to reason about what christ reveal we get into trouble unles you be infallible there be very few thing you can be certain of to the extent that doctrine rely on fallible human think they can not be certain that be the problem of seem arrogant the non-christian around u know that human be make mistake just a surely a we know it they do not believe we be infallible any more than we do when christian speak a if they believe their own reason can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we be infallible the non christian around u rarely believe that implicit claim witnessing be hardly go to work when the person you be talk to believe that you be either too foolish to recognise ymy own limit or intentionally try to cover them up i think it would be far better to say what thing we be certain of and what thing we be only very confident of for example we might say that we know my sin for recognise sin be something we directly experience but other thing whether base on reason from scripture or extra-biblical think should not be labled a infallible we should say that we be very confident of them and be ready to explain my reason but so far a i be aware none of u be infallible speak or act a if my think be flawles be ridiculou rexlex suggest that person read he be there and he be not silent by franci schaeffer i do think very highly of it but i think that mr schaeffer be grossly overrate by many evangelical christian somebody else might like it though so do let my opinion stop you from read it if someone be interest in my opinion i suggest on certainty by ludwig wittgenstein darren f provine kilroy if any substantial number of reader read some wittgenstein of the post would disappear if they understand some wittgenstein would disappear michael l siemon
