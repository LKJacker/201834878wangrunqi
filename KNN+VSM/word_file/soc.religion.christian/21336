from gerry palo subject re christianity and repeat life in article jek write gerry palo write there be nothing in christianity that preclude the idea of repeat life on earth the apostle paul roman point out that god choose jacob rather than esau to be the ancestor of the covenant person and ultimately of the messiah and that he make thi choice while the two boy be still in their mother womb and therefore could not possibly have do anything good or evil to deserve their appoint destiny if we admit the possibility that they have live previou life and that in accordance with the asiatic idea of karma their present life be a reward or punishment for past behavimy thi make nonsense of paul whole point the existence of repeat earth life and destiny karma do not mean that everything that happen be predetermine by past deed there be an oriental view of it that tend in that direction but i do not subscribe to that view god may choose one individual over another a the fit instrument for hi plan but that do not preclude that the development of that individual into what he be in thi earthly life be not the result of a longer course of development i do not and rudolf steiner do not subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable mechanistic karma determine everything that befall one thi be a kind of shrivel caricature of a much greater law in the context of which the deed of christ on golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human be a a work of christ can be see a the master theme and indeed a new impulse that wa completely free of karma christ incarnate only once in the flesh and in that he have no debt of karma or sin the oriental concept of reincarnation and karma which be even more trivialize and mechanize in some new age teach incorrectly assume jesu christ to have be the reincarnation of a master avatar etc their teach of reincarnation and karma also ha no concept the continue individuality from one life to the next buddhism more important they have no concept of the resurrection of the body the ultimate continuity of the whole human be to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the last day there be another biblical passage that also ha a bear it be the tenth chapter of john devote almost entirely to the man bear blind clearly here jesu tell the disciple that it wa not hi past karma or that of hi parent that lead to hi blindnes but rather that a new impulse be to be reveal through him but note that he do not refute the disciple question in fact they ask it a a matter of course the question be state a if it be self evident that only one of two possibility exist it wa either the sin of the man himself obviously not in thi incarnation or the sin of hi parent the fact that they even ask about the first possibility at all indicate an awarenes of the idea on their part and the form of christ answer indicate that he do not disagree with it there be also matthew where jesu say straight out about john the baptist if you care to accept it he himself be elia who wa to come thi also emphasize that the gospel do not have a positive teach either way about reincarnation or in fact about what happen to the human be at all between death and the last day even jesu do not push thi teach on person who be not ready to embrace it if you care to accept it so i take care to point out not that the bible teach reincarnation but that it do not deny it either and that much in both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine become understandable if reincarnation be understand in the right way i pointedly use repeat earth life to distinguish a little from the oriental doctrine usually associate with the word reincarnation the phrase be rudolf steiner wiederholte erdenleben he note too that the idea need to arise a a new insight in the west completely free from eastern tradition it do in the eighteenth and nineteenth century the most important expression of it be lessing the education of the human race to return to ymy original point paul statement about jacob and esau do not contradict the idea of repeat earth life and karma and both of these principle receive their fulfillment in the incarnation death and resurrection ascension and return of jesu christ in my view regard gerry palo
