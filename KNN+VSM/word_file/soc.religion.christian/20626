from shellgate llo larry l overacker subject re the arrogance of christian in article caralv carol alvin write vbv virgilio dean b velasco jr write in article caralv carol alvin write are all truth also absolute is all of scripture truth and therefore absolute the answer to both question be ye perhap we have different definition of absolute then to me an absolute be something that be constant acros time culture situation etc true in every instance possible do you agree with thi definition i think you do similarly all truth be absolute indeed a non-absolute truth be a contradiction in term when be something absolute when it be alway true obviously if a truth be not alway true then we have a contradiction in term i agree with carol here determining absolute be practically speak a waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth be in fact relative for example i recently wa ask some child the question what temperature do water boil at i get the answer degree consistently i ask if they know what scale and wa tell it just degree any scale that what all thermometer say well that sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it be simply wrong it be not an absolute truth similarly scripture be full of truth which we should nurture and cherish but try to determine which part be absolute truth and which part be the manifestation of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text wa pen be miss the point then religion easily become an intellectual head-trip devoid of the live experience of the indwell trinity and become dead scholasticism imo example of head-covering in church delete thi wa a good example there may be an absolute truth behind the write but the simplest understand of the passage be that the instruction apply to the corinthian and not necessarily elsewhere the instruction may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth which wa have a lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me no and i see no compel or even reasonable reason that it should be evangelical be clearly not take thi particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there be plenty of other example can you reconcile thi even the most die-hard literalist do not take all of the bible literally i yet to meet anyone who take the verse bless be he who take ymy baby and smash their head against the rock literally the bible wa not print or hand to u by god with color cod to tell u what part should be interpret which way many person claim that there be no absolute in the world such a statement be terribly self-contradictory let me put it to you thi way if there be no absolute should we conclude that the statement there be no absolute be not absolutely true obviously we have a contradiction here i do claim that there be no absolute i think there be very few though and determine absolute be difficult i agree very few and even if we know them personally we may not be able to expres that in a way that still convey absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolute may not make any difference since i know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walk up and greet me there be hardly consensu even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regard biblical interpretation so person sometime disagree about what be true thi do not negate the fact however that there be still absolute in the universe i ca prove the existence of absolute i can only rely upon my experience i also trust god revelation that we can not fully comprehend the infinite therefore we ca comprehend the absolute so i do need them i can never know the essence of god only the energy by and through which god be manifest to god creation so the reality can be that there are absolute but it be of no practical importance it like claim that the original scriptural autograph be perfect but copy may not be swell who care it do affect me in any practical useful way i might a well believe that god ha make a lot of electric blue chicken and that they live on mar maybe god do so what is that go to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god whether or not i go to thi or that cafeterium for lunch no thi attitude lead many non-christian to believe that all christian be arrogant idiot incapable of critical reason christianity be true wonderful and sensible it appeal to reason since reason be an inner reflection of the logo of god explanation that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian response to a complex world note i not claim there be no place for authority that be silly there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative be en expression of authority that respect other authoritarian be en expression of authority that fail to do that and be generally agressive good parent like god be authoritative many christian be simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few adult
