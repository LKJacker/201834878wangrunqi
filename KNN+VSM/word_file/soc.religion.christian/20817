from alvin kenneth alvin subject re certainty and arrogance responding to the moderator in article alvin kenneth alvin write choosing what to believe and rely on be important area of personal sovereignty what bother me be when other suggest that in these matter of faith their specific belief be not only true to them but be absolute and should be bind on other it follow from thi that god must give everyone the same revelation of truth and thu anyone who come to a different conclusion be intentionally choose the wrong path thi be the arrogance i see a lack of respect for the honest conclusion of other on matter which be between them and god it be certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about my own ability to know the truth there be also different path in some area of practice but i like to see more clarification about what you mean when you reject the idea of say their specific belief be not only true to them but be absolute and should be bind on other if something be true it be true for everyone assume that the belief be something about god history etc ye i agree what i try to point out be that in matter of faith tenet which be not logically persuasive one may be convince of the truth of certain thing through for instance personal revelation and it certainly fine to share that revelation or those belief with other and i do think that it arrogant persay to accept matter of pure faith a truth for oneself where i think the conflict arise be in assume that where disagreement on belief arise all other must have be give the same truth and that god must reveal hi truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree i think thi can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagree with you be be sinful or dishonest that they be reject something they know to be truth because it be inconvenient for them or because they wish to spurn god i would say that thi be equivalent to assume that all truth one hold be universal and absolute and the problem i see with thi be that it negate the individuality of human and their relationship with god thi do not mean there be no absolute truth just that some area of doctrinal disagreement may be area where god ha not establish or reveal that truth comment criticism welcome ken alvin i agree with you clh
