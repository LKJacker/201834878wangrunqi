from ejalbert subject re monophysite and mike walker in article d andrew byler write mike walker if you be use the standard formula of fully god and fully human that i not sure why you object to say that jesu wa human i think the usual analysi would be that sin be not part of the basic definition of humanity it a consequence of the fall jesu be human but not a fall human clh i differ with my moderator on thi i think the whole idea of god come down to earth to live a one of u subject to sin and death a one of the consecration prayer in the book of common prayer put it wa that jesu wa tempt but do not succumb if sin be not part of the basic definition of humanity then jesu fully human nicea would not be subject to sin but then the resurrection losis some of it mean because we encounter my humanity most powerfully when we sin to distinguish between human and fall human make jesu le like one of u at the time we need him most these issue get mighty subtle when you see person say different thing it often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different thing or whether they be use different terminology i do think there any question that there be a problem with nestoriu and i would agree that the say christ have a human form without a real human nature or will be heretical but i like to be a bite wary about the copt armenian etc recent discussion suggest that their monophysite position may not be a far from orthodoxy a many have think nestoriu wa an extreme representative of one of the two major school of think more moderate representative be regard a orthodox theodore of mopsuestium my impression be that the modern monophysite group inherit the entire tradition not just nestoriu version and that some of them may have a sufficient balance position to be regard a orthodox clh first the monophysite inherit none of nestoriu version they be on the opposite end of the spectrum from him second the historical record suggest that the position attribute to nestoriu be not a extreme a hi successful opponent who write the conventional history claim mainly nestoriu oppose the term theotoko for mary argue i think correctly that a human could not be call mother of god i mean in the athanasian creed we talk about the son uncreate surely even arian would concede that jesu exist long before mary anyway nestoriu opponent claim that by say mary wa not theotoko that he claim that she only give birth to the human nature of jesu which would require two seperate and distinct nature the argument fail though because mary simply give birth to jesu who preexist her either divinely if you accept nestorianism a commonly define or both nature intertwine a la chalcedon second i be not sure that nestorianism be not a better alternative than the orthodox view after all i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation that jesu human nature wa in heaven likewise post-ascension i think rather that god come to earth and take my nature upon him it wa a seperate nature capable of be tempt a in gethsemane since i believe the divine nature could never be tempt but in it moment of weaknes the divine nature prevail comment on the above warmly appreciate jason albert there may be difference in what we mean by subject to sin the original complaint wa from someone who do see how we could call jesu fully human because he do sin i completely agree that jesu wa subject to temptation i simply object to the idea that by not succumb he be thereby not fully human i believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human i again apologize for confuse nestorianism and monophysitism i agree with you and have say elsewhere that there reason to think that not everyone who be associate with heretical position wa in fact heretical there be scholar who maintain that nestoriu wa not nestorian i have to confes that the first time i read some of the correspondence between nestoriu and hi opponent i think he get the better of them however most scholar do believe that the work that eventually lead to chalcedon wa an advance and that nestoriu wa at the very least rash and dogmatic a the editor of the christological controversy refer to him in reject all approach other than hi own a regular usenet reader know narrownes can be just a much an impediment a be wrong furthermore he do say some thing that i think be problematical he respond to a rather mild letter from cyril with a flame worthy of usenet in it he say to attribute also to the logo in the name of the incarnation the characteristic of the flesh that ha be conjoin with him be my brother either the work of a mind which truly err in the fashion of the greek or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of ariu and apollinari and the other those who be thu carry away with the idea of thi association be bind because of it to make the divine logo have a part in be feed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hi fearfulnes these thing be take falsely when they be put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for u who perpetrate the falsehood it all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity but the whole concept of incarnation be base on exactly the idea that the divine logo do in fact have to some degree a part in be bear grow up and die of course it must be understand that there a certain indirectnes in the logo participation in these thing but there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human or we do have an incarnation at all nestoriu seem to think in black and white term and miss the sort of nuance one need to deal with thi area you say i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation that jesu human nature wa in heaven i do think that require by orthodox doctrine it the divine logo that be eternal clh
