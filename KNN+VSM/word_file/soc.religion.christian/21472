from gerry palo subject re christianity and repeat life in article smayo sc ott a mayo write gerry palo write there be nothing in christianity that preclude the idea of repeat life on earth do it say somewhere it be appoint to man once to die and then judgement i do have a concordance here but i have some dim memory that thi appear somewhere in the bible given a fairly specific context for what judgement be i say that more or le decide the issue heb clh indeed the immediate context nasb be otherwise he would have need to suffer often since the foundation of the world but now once at the consummation he ha be manifest to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and inasmuch a it be appoint for man to die once and after thi come judgement so christ also have be offer once to bear the sin of many shall appear a second time not to bear sin tro those who eagerly await him the first point be that thi verse be part of an even larger context the subject of which be not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of christ sacrifice once and the fulfillment of the law for all of fall mankind rudolf frieling elaborate thi in detail in hi christianity and reincarnation the thrust of the passage in it context be to liken the one time incarnation and sacrifice of christ for all mankind to the individual experience of the human be after death the once be repeat and emphasize and it highlight the singularity of christ deed one thing for certain it do be to refute the claim of some that christ incarnate more than once but the comparison to the human experience die once then judgement note not the judgement but just judgement the word for judgement be krisi hebrew be the one passage most often quote in defense of the doctrine that the bible deny reincarnation at thi point i would just emphasize again that the passage that arguably speak against it be few and that invariably they be talk about something ele and the apparent denial of reincarnation be either infer or a in the case of hebrew take literally and deposit into an imply context namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human be after death what should be consider seriously be that the bible be essentially silent about the fate of the individual human be between death and the last day if you take the few passage that could possibly be interpret to mean a single earth life they be arguable and there be other passage that point arguably in the other direc tion such a matthew and john we can continue to debate the individual scrap of scripture that might have a bearinig on thi and indeed we should discus them but what i want to introduce into the discussion wa an approach to the idea of repeat earth life that unlike hindu buddhist and new age teach take full cognizance of the divinity singular incarnation death burial resurrection and second come of christ a the savior of mankind the accountability of each individual for hi deed and the reality of the fall and of sin and it consequence the redemption of man from sin through christ the resurrection of the body and the last judgement taken in thi larger sense many seriou question take on an entirely different perspective the destiny of those who die in their sin before christ come the relationship of faith and grace to work the mean of deathbed conversion the mean of the sacrament and many other thing not that i propose to answer all those question by a simple doctrine of convenience but only that the discussion take on a different dimension and in my opinion one that be truly worthy of both man the earth and their creator and redeemer there be many deep question that continue to be deep such a the mean of the second death and how the whole of christian doctrine would apply to thi larger perspective of human existence there be those who deeply believe that the thing of which the bible do not speak be not thing we should be concern with but christ also indicate that there be other thing that we would come to know in the future include thing that hi disciple and therefore other could not bear yet thi idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge not only of the individual in one lifetime but of the whole of humanity also take on great mean when we realize that my growth in the spirit be a long term proces the bible wa not mean to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeem deed of christ take the gospel in the greater context from genesi to revelation now salvation heal become not the end of man sojourn but it begin and the last judgement and the new heaven and earth that follow it become it fulfullment gerry palo
