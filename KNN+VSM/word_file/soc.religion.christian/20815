from fostma mark gregory foster subject re sabbath admission in article dlecoint write faq and dariu response delete dariu it not clear how much more need to be say other than the faq i think paul comment on esteem one day over another rom be probably all that need to be say i accept that dariu be do what he do in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all day alike be similarly do their best to honor the lord i be myself an sda and i be in total agreement with what dariu ha to say i also worship on saturday to honor the lord ymy mention of esteem all day alike imo ha to do with the fast day observe by the jew but no matter how you interpret that passage i do accept ymy worship on sunday a be do in honor of the lord in contrast with what many of my fellow sda believer may believe to me though the bible overwhelmingly point to saturday a the day to be keep in honor of creation and of god deliverance of the israelite from egyptian bondage to those who would attempt to point out that my observance of saturday be be legalistic thi be simply not the case rather keep saturday allow me a full day to rest and contemplate god goodnes and grace however i like to be clear that i do not think there unambiguou proof that regular christian worship wa on the first day a i indicate there be response on both of the passage cite similarly with cor it say that on the first day they should set aside money for paul collection now if you want to believe that they gather specially to do thi or that they do it in their home i ca disprove it but the obviou time for a congregation to take an offer would be when they normally gather for worship and if they be expect to do it in their home there would be no reason to mention a specific day the idea wa introduce to me once that the reason paul want the corinthian to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the week wa because that wa when they receive their weekly wage paul want them to lay aside money for the collection a first priority before spend their money on other thing i do not have any proof in front of me for thi though although it would explain why they would lay aside money in their home instead of a meet so i think the most obviou read of thi be that on the first day of every week simply mean every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implication and not clear statement be that the nt author assume that their reader know when christian worship wa it would seem to me that you assume that the christian in the nt regularly worship on the first day i assume that the christian in the nt regularly worship on the seventh day but i agree with you that we only have implication because the author do assume the reader know when worhip wa mark
