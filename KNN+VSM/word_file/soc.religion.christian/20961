from mussack christopher mussack subject re tuff to be a christian please realize that i be frequently get in trouble for stray from orthodoxy but here be my opinion in article mdb no name write moreover the buddha say that we be intrinsically good a against christ we be all sinner i never think of these two idea be against each other person might quibble about what intrinsically mean but the reason we be sinner be because we do not behave a good a we be the message of christ be that each of u be not only good but great that we can approach perfection albeit perhap through a different technique than you claim buddhism teach because we do not realize my greatnes we sin peter have no problem walk on water until a little doubt creep in do david ask in the psalm what be man that you god should care for him but you have make him just a little lower than the angel i probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid david wa just a i probably exagerate what a gigantic monster goliath wa but david power easily defeat goliath remember the rich young man who come up to jesu and ask what he can do to enter the kingdom jesu say follow the commandment i alway picture the smug look on hi face a he say he do that hi whole life probably anticipate an attaboy from the messiah instead jesu gife him a harder task sell everything and follow him jesu be raise the bar the desciple say how can anyone do thi if it so hard even for rich person jesu say anyone can do it with god help jesu say not only can we avoid kill person we can avoid get angry at person not only can we avoid commit adultery we can control my own desire i realize thi wa not ymy main point but i wonder how other person see thi parting question would you have become a christian if you have not be indoctrinate by ymy parent you probably never learn about any other religion to make a comparative study and therefore i claim you be brain wash please forgive any generalization i be about to make ymy point about how hard other religion be be a good one just a ymy parting question be a tough question i think that muslim worship the same god a i do we can learn from their name submission hindu and buddhist and taoist etc claim that god be impersonal is god personal or impersonal i say ye but if i think a little more my answer be whichever be greater i think it be greater to be a personal entity with an individual consciousnes but you right that that might be a cultural bia if i think more i must admit that god personal nature be a far beyond my conception a hi impersonal nature be beyond the hindu conception if somehow jesu could fit into hindu cosmology then maybe i would have a problem though that be hard to imagine are there any former or present eastern religion member here who could comment chri mussack
