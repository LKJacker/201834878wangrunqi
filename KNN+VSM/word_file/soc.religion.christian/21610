from pwhite peter white subject re question about hell in article wytten dale wyttenbach write what be the basi of the idea of hell be a place of eternal suffer if it be biblical please reference here my train of think if god be use the earth to manufacture heavenly be then it be logical that there would be a certain yield and a certain amount of waste the yield go to heaven and the waste be burn destroy in hell why be it necessary to punish the waste rather than just destroy it luke talk about the rich man and lazaru matthew talk about the eternal fire prepare for the devil and hi angel revelation and reference thi fire a the place where unbeliever be throw matthew talk about be throw into the eternal fire and the fire of hell it seem quite clear that there be thi place where a fire burn forever from the revelation passage it be clear that the devil and hi angel will be torment there forever from the matthew passage it do seem abundantly clear whether the punishment of unbeliever be everlasting in the sense of final or in the sense of continual from dale question i come away with the suggestion that hell if it be short might be an acceptable alternative to live forever with the source of life peace and joy the unbeliever cease to exist wherea if punishment go on continually then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it it definately seem to me that hell be something we want to avoid regardles of it exact nature there seem to be two main question in dale think what be god main plan on earth why be continual punishment a necessary part of hell a oppose to simply destroy completely those who refuse god i believe that god main plan be to have a genuine relationship with person the nature of hell and the reason for it nature seem a lot more difficult to ascertain it do seem clear that hell be something to avoid at a minimum hell be the state one be in when one ha nothing to do with god in the bible i be not aware of any discussion about the specific of hell beyond the general of hot unpleasant and torment for instance it be not discuss how if at all the rich man can continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or whether there be some point at which the pain sense ability be burn up if you can forgive the graphicalnes if you throw a physical body into a fire assume the person start out alive at some fairly quick point the nerve be destroy and pain be no longer sense it be not state what occur when at the judgement the unbeliever who be already physically dead be cast into hell they no longer have a physical body so they ca feel physical pain what could be sense continually be that those in hell be to be forever without god the man parable be tell with the idea of have the listener think in physical term in order to get the point that some person wo listen to god even after he rise from the dead the point of the parable be to reach the hard-hearted here who be not listen to the fact of the resurrection nor the gospel about jesu christ it seem reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell be not even remotely pleasant peter white disclaimer none of what be write necessarily reflect a view of my company phil i want to know christ and the power of hi resurrection and the fellowship of share in niv hi suffer become like him in hi death
