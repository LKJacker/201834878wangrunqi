from scott scott shalkowski subject re doing the work of god desiree bradley write the next sunday the sermon wa about joshua where the israelite take jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there except for rahab who have shelter the spy with those report about bosnium in my mind i felt uncomfortable about the minister say that the massacre the one in joshua wa right but what really bother me wa that if i wa go to try take christianity seriously i should be so trouble about the report of ethnic cleanse in bosnium certainly my sympathy should be with the moslim considering that the bosnian muslim be descendant of christian who under turkish rule convert to islam could the serb be do god work perhap it would be useful to ask whether those do the ethnic cleanse could be say to be love those they be kill in the very act of kill do it reflect the attitude of god who send rain to both the just and the unjust if not then christian should be uncomfortable with it jesu give hi follower the law of love to follow and it be by exhibit thi that disciple will be know doctrinal or political correctnes be not the standard so i do see why christian should be move against the serb because their ancestor convert from christianity to islam it seem to me that a a christian you should be trouble by the ethnic cleanse peace scott shalkowski scott
