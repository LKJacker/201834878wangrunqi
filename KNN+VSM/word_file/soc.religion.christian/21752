from geno subject re mary assumption when elizabeth greet mary elizabeth say something to the effect that mary out of all woman wa bless if so it appear that thi exactly place mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity i remember a couple of time when my ex-girlfriend say that she think she wa bless because of her son whom she love dearly in fact i hear person refer to someone a be bless quite a few time it a common figure of speech considering that elizabeth wa just another human i think thi passage offer nothing toward justify the blessednes of mary
