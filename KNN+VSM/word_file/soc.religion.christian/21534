from hall hal f lillywhite subject eternal marriage wa mormon temple in article dhammer pacific david hammerslag write thi paragraph bring to mind a question how do you mormon reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with christ statement that in the ressurection person will neither marry nor be give in marriage luke chapt well here be something i write some time ago in response to a similar question i hope it help begin repeat of previou post a for the scripture mention i agree that it do seem to be a problem not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general luke version ha jesu say that the child of thi world marry and be give in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven it almost sound like marriage disqualify one for salvation matthew and mark both omit thi statement i think the account be not a clear a they might be let have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable idea of what it mean the scripture involve be mat mark and luke what happen wa that the sadducee who do not believe in the resurrection think they could trap jesu they make reference to the leverite marriage which require the brother of a man who die without child to take the widow to wife and raise up child the child would be consider child of the decease just a though the woman first husband have father them it seem obviou from thi that the woman wa still consider in a way to be the wife of her first husband however the sadducee concoct a scene in which brother of the decease each in hi turn fail to father child by the widow they seem to imply that the leverite marriage wa equal to the first for they ask whose wife shall she be in the resurrection at thi point it seem obviou that if she be anybody wife it be the first husband after all have she bear child they would have be credit to him regardles of which brother wa the biological father it be possible jesu wa refer to thi when he say ye do err not know the scripture or the power of god mat compare mark phrase not in luke account anyway the sadducee ask whose wife will she be in the resurrection see that all have her jesu answer be that in the resurrection they neither marry nor be give in marriage mat when they rise from the dead they neither marry mark they which be account worthy to obtain that world neither marry luke all account go on to say but be a the angel in heaven or the equivalent i find thi last not very helpful since the bible do not define angel nor give any idea what their life be like some minister claim that they be sexles different that human etc but i can find no biblical support for thi i think what jesu be say here and it be clearest in matthew and mark account be that marriage will not be perform in the resurrection thi go along with my belief that if a person be to marry at all it must be do on thi earth however we do believe that a marriage perform by the authority of god can be bind in eternity in fact the first marriage appear to have be perform by god himself before death enter the world in the garden of eden what therefore god hath join together let not man put asunder mat jesu also tell peter and the other apostle that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bind in heaven mat i believe that thi also refer to marriage perform by the proper authority
