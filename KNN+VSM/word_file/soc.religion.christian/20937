from rexlex subject assurance of hell i dream that the great judgment morning have dawn and the trumpet have blow i dream that the sinner have gather for judgment before the white throne oh what weep and wail a the lose be tell of their fate they cry for the rock and the mountain they pray but their prayer be too late the soul that have put off salvation not tonight i get save by and by no time now to think of religion ala he have find time to die and i saw a great white throne now some have protest by say that the fear of hell be not good for motivation yet jesu think it wa paul think it wa paul say knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade man today too much of my evangelism be nothing but soft soap and some of it be nothing but evangelical salesmanship we do tell person anymore that there such a thing a sin or that there such a place a hell a jayne ha say thi do mean we have to come on so strong so a to hit person over the head with a baseball bat yet the fact remain there be a place call hell a place so fearful that god die to save u from have to experience it whatever you or i a christian do we should do whatever we can to win person to the lord if for no other reason to keep them from go to outer darknes jesu in mt tell u that he do prepare hell for person he prepare it for the devil and hi angel no where in the bible do i read anywhere that god predestine anybody to go to hell moody use to say that the elect be the whosoever will and the nonelect be the whosoever wont whether or not that theologically sound i could defend but it practical jesu say to the person of israel ye would not now some of you may not be student of the bible heck some of you may not be christian have you ever say to somebody i do believe in hell i believe in the religion of jesu but do you know that jesu talk more about hell than he do about heaven oh i believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount you find hell teach by jesu in the sermon on the mount you read that jesu talk about the tree be cast into the fire several time he talk about hell and about judgment in fact over and over in the synoptic matthew mark and luke jesu talk about hell not isaiah not mosis not john the baptist though he do but jesu the son of god the great beloved one preach about hell because he love person and do want to see them go there now if there be no hell then jesu preach in vain it wa my lord jesu not some angry baptist preacher that say where the worm never dy and where the fire never go out jesu say that it wa jesu who call hell a furnace of fire it wa jesu that use the word condemnation and thi be the condemnation that man love darknes rather than light because their deed be evil jesu say that how can we get it acros to you that a love die jesu preach about hell not only that but he go through hell that what calgary wa all about when my lord wa on the cro darknes fell he call hell outer darknes do you have thi idea that hell be a place where the gambler be gamble over here the drink be get drink over there and the prostitute be prostitute their body over there that not what hell be hell not a party there no fellowship there he call it outer darknes outer away from god darknes god be light no when he wa on the cro he wa make sin for you and for me god treat jesu the way sinner have to be treat that be a sober think a my son would say an awesome think my god my god why hast thou forsake me hell be isolation there no fellowship in hell there no friendship in hell there no love embrace in hell there no hand shake in hell there no word of encouragement in hell i thirst it go much deeper than physical thirst hell be eternal crave with no satisfaction the man whose life wa live for drug will crave it eternally the man whose life wa live for the lust of a woman body will crave it eternally and not be satisfy one theologian ha put it thi way and i think it deserve merit what be hell hell be just the kind of environment that match the internal condition of the lose in a recent post i wa try to remember the founder of the word of life ministry i remember hi name jack wertzen and find that the illustration that i give wa hi hi illustration wa that he wa talk to hi barber and hi barber wife and daughter have just recently be save and he wa comment about it to jack they sing these song and read bible verse and their praise thi and that i ca stand it jack do you think god would send me to hell jack answer by say ye i think he would of course the barber say what do you mean by that well if you ca stand live at home with ymy wife and daughter who sing hymn and praise to god now what would you do in heaven where they do it for eternity you be miserable because god love you he put you where it would match what you really be it make a man think the crucifixion of jesu christ be a fact that necessitate the eternal existence of hell because on the cro he perform an eternal act do ask me how i do know but he be god and he be the and when he die he die an death it be by that eternal act that he purchase eternal life for the whosoever will he suffer eternal judgment a lot of person would like to detmy around hell by say everybody be go to be save eventually universalism my bible say no he separate them the sheep from the goat after you die there a probationary period in which god prepare you for heaven no my bible say that it be appoint unto man once to die and then come judgment some of the cultist believe in annihilation after you die sssswish just like a mosquito you squish out no in rev we be tell that their be eternal existence in hell just a there be in heaven i do enjoy make these kind of statement and maybe you do enjoy listen to them but we have to preach the entire word of god there be a place call hell if i could give one verse of scripture that could give any hope that person be go there i give it to you but i have find it that fact that there be a place call hell the fact that my god be a god of holines and must judge sin the fact that he ha make u the kind of creature we be and therefore we responsible the fact that he ha place u in a uni verse that ha purpose and design behind it the fact that sin be such an awful thing and the fact that god himself go through hell to save u from hell lead u to two application a i already mention if you be a christian you must wear other it not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge be out knowing therefore the terror of lord we persuade man if you have accept jesu be ymy savior you take an awful chance a i say to the jehovah witness who no longer frequent my door if you be right and i be wrong then i will have live a good life and will die and cease to exist but if i be right and you be wrong then you will die and suffer eternal damnation i do mean to make fun at thi point but it like dirty harry say you get to ask yourself i feel lucky well do you a man get to know hi limitation do be one of the whosoever wont because while i wa yet a sinner he die for me there no greater love than thi that a man lay down hi life for another rex
