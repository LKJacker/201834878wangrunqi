from d andrew byler subject re question about virgin mary a the moderator note i think you mean the assumption catholic believe that the blessed virgin mary go to heaven body and soul at the end of her life thi be unusual because the normal course of event be for ymy body to decay in the grave and stay that way until the resurrection of the dead well it wa that way for enoch and elijah both of whom be translate directly into heaven it beyond my grasp why some object that mary who wa far greater than either enoch or elijah should not benefit from the same privelege they recieved she wa after all mother of god full of grace and immaculate historically belief in the assumption can be find in the write of st gregory of tour late century and in st germain of constantinople and st john of damascu and in st andrew of crete among other and it should be note that the monophysite chruch of egypt and syrium also hold to thi belief a part of divine revelation even though they break away from the unity of the chruch in ad by reject the council of chalcedon it might be argue by some protestant that the catholic and orthodox make thi belief up but the monophysite put a big hole in that notion a they also hold the belief and they split from the chruch before the belief wa first annunciate in write a far a be know much ha be lose from the time of the father andy byler
