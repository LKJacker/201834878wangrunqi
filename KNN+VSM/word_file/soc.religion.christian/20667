from sliew selbyn liew subject re an agnostic question in article jdt jim tomlinson jimt ius write goodnes that be within the power of each of u now the complication be that one of my best friend ha become very fundamentalist that would normally be a non-issue with me but he hello firstly what do you exactly mean by fundamentalist i will for the time be assume that what you mean be that ymy friend believe that the bible be god word to mankind i suspect that what happen to him be what he call be bear again anyway wa that recent if the answer be ye to all the question above it be quite understandable however imo rather give advice to ymy friend i think i be through something similar to him and one thing i can say be that the basic problem be that each of you be now try to communicate from different worldview why he talk about those thing be because they be now obviou to him what be obviou to him be not obviou to you secondly why he may be very persuasive be because from hi point of view he ha be on both side of the fence thi i mean that before he turn fundamentalist you two be agreeable because both of you see thing from the same side if suddenly a if a new world of reality ha suddenly open up to him it be like the discovery of let say a new continent or a new planet to him he get to tell you because he ha see something much more wonderful than where he wa and what he think be much better than where you be now you have get to realise that from hi point of view he mean well to you eventhough he may end up offend you to him it be worth that risk nevertheles it be really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you a well at thi moment it may be difficult because he be either very excite or feel it be too urgent to keep quiet about however he may not realise that he really put you off the bible that it be so so my question be how can i convince him that thi be a subject better leave undiscussed so we can preserve what be in all area other than religiou belief a great friendship how do i convince him that i be save so he wo try thank for any advice so far i only be try to explain thing from hi side however i do understand how you feel too because i wa a christian for a good part of my life a well i wa quite turn off by christian or fundamentalist who be really all out and enthusiastic about their faith they really scar me to tell you the truth unfortunately religiou belief be a very personal thing just a ymy agnosticism be also a very personal thing to you since the christian belief be inevitably at odd with anything non-christian religiou or otherwise it will be a touchy matter like all friendship it will take both side to do their part to make it work in thi matter maybe you can do ymy part by tell him nicely that you be not able to dig what he try to convince you about that it beyond you or not ymy concern for now do tell him it nonsense because to him it be reality and that would be a real insult he also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too like i say before i wish i could give ymy friend some advice too i admit that i do similarly to some of my friend when i become a christian in some way i wish i could have do thing a little differently however it wa difficult then because i wa so excite and just blabber away about what i find to me it wa too good not to know to some i wa crazy and i do really care most of the time what they think you will probably think he crazy too but god be very real to him a real a you be to him keep that in mind and he think he can convince you because since god be so real to him he do see why god ca be real to you too i do know how helpful thi be to you but all the best anyhow thi be quite a challenge for you to face by the way personal conviction nobody be beyond save except the one we call the devil and hi host regard selbyn liew dept of ee engineering university of melbourne victorium australium email sliew ph fax
