from kolassa john kolassa subject re definition of christianity in article clh write often we get into discussion about who be christian unfortunately there be a number of possible definition starting from the broadest commonly use definition be the next level be an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition which include all of the major strand of christianity but exclude group that be felt to be outside historic christianity thi be of course a slippery enterprise since catholic could argue that protestant be outside historic christianity etc but i think the most commonly accept definition would be base on something like the nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon are you sure you want to include chalcedon here i presume that you mean the description of jesu a fully human and fully devine almost everyone would consider the majority of copt and armenian and the jacobite a christian yet for century it ha be maintain that they disagree with the formula of chalcedon those that would consider them christian be most likely to object that these community do require a personal commitment to jesu which be only tangentially relate to the formula of chalcedon thank john kolassa kolassa a i understand the recent discussion here the copt for all practical purpose accept chalcedon they talk about one nature rather than two but the issue seem to be one of terminology rather than substance clh
