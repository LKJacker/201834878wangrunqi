from koberg allen koberg subject re the bible available in every language wa re satanic tounge in article write in article koberg allen koberg write the concept of tongue a use at pentecost seem an outdated concept now with the bible available in nearly every language and missionary who be out there in all language why do the church need tongue i gues there be at least some person who be not able to support thi claim there be still a lot of language without the bible or a part of the bible there be still many language which we be not able to write simply because the write version of the language ha not yet be define ye i suppose that true of course notice i qualify with nearly every language and there be missionary out there who can speak every imaginable language and dialect but then the fact that not all language have a written gospel lend no credence to the concept of pentecost type xenoglossolalium since most tongue occur not in these place of un-written language but rather in church full of person who do have a write language and a bible in that language but i nitpick
