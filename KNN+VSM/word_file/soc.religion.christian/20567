from dmn there a seeker bear every minute subject hell atterlep cardinal ximenez write here how i talk to non-christian who be complain about hell me do you believe you go to heaven him i do believe in heaven me so be you go there him if there wa a heaven i would me but since there be a heaven you not go there be you him no the point be that heaven be base on faith if you do believe in heaven there no way you go to be in it hmmm person in the america before the time of christ child who die young etc of course the next step be i do believe in hell either so why will i be there it seem to me that hell be eternal death and seperation from god but of course the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect be something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousnes at the very least most atheist do believe that when they die they will die forever and never see god so they do in fact believe that they go to hell i think a good number of atheist believe there be nothing beyond bodily death but it be simply an abuse of language to say they believe they go to hell they believe they go to die understand that you turn hell into a verb using the same logic it also follow that all animal be to hell are you sure thi be what you want to say presumably animal do have the opportunity to get to heaven but thi still do change the fact that they go to hell die a final death i do claim to know whether or not there be an afterlife of some sort but if hell be a you describe final death and not eternal perpetuation of consciousnes it will be true that there will never be a moment when i be aware of my non-existence assume i to hell and not to heaven in other word i never know i dead hmmm hell do have to be worse than earth to be hell because it eternal ever hear person say of a love one who wa ill and ha die at least she not suffer any more she in heaven now consider the follow statement at least she not suffer any more she in hell now the above statement sound odd but accord to ymy definition of hell it would be a true statement the person in hell would not be suffer granted they would be anything would be have any consciou experience whatsoever you say hell death be eternal however thi losis it mean to a dead person and to me it seem that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only make force if one expect to be consciou throughout thi eternity many atheist believe that the thirst for an afterlife be simply the product of propaganda friend do you want the free gift of e-ternal life it my understand that the early jew do not believe in an afterlife can anyone back me up on thi combine with the survival instinct all animal share the difference be we have consciousnes and once we get the idea of eternal life drill into my brain we then desire a sort of super-survival and it a lot worse than heaven that the only comparison that matter that would depend on what heaven be like if god be a king and an eternity in heaven consist of give thank and praise to the king i might opt for hell i read a lovely account of a missionary try to convert eskimo to christianity in the book the illusion of immortality by corlis lamont the missionary start to speak about heaven are there seal in heaven will we be able to go hunt ask an eskimo the missionary say no the group of eskimo then say something to the effect of well what good be ymy heaven if there no hunt scram i highly recommend the above book ious to anyone who want an account of the other side of the immortality coin that there be no immortality alan terlep incestuou vituperousnes oakland university rochester mi atterlep melissa eggertsen rushing in where angel fear to tread pax dana
