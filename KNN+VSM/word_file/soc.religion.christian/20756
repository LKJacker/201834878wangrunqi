from pwhite peter white subject some question from a new christian reply-to pwhite in article steven r hoskin write i have another question i would like to ask i be not yet affiliate with any one congregation aside from matter of taste what criterium should one use in choose a church i do really know the difference between the variou protestant denomination here in america person tend to think of choose a church much like they think of choose a car or a country club what i mean be that my culture be such that we tend toward satisfy my own want rather than consider thing with other in mind and not make prayer an initial and primary part of the decision proces person tend to treat church a they would a club and when something be le than to their like off they go to another one i think that scripture present the idea that god take a different perspective on the church choose proces it seem to me from that god do subscribe to the idea of u choose a church at all but that he place u in the body a he want u so i think a better question be not how do i choose a church but how do i figure out where god be try to place me if a person wa instrumental in lead you to christ the church they go to be a logical first choice you have be bear into the family of god person should hop around from church to church a often a they hop from natural family to family if you meet the lord on ymy own so to speak there may not be an easily identifiable church to try for starter here you be more like an orphan prayerfully go and leave yourself on a few doorstep and see if anyplace feel like home i would expect that god want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fit in with the person but on the other hand there be no perfect church if you have an attitude of look for problem you will both find them and make them on the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment you will spread that wherever you go in general i think that god will try to place you in a church that talk about the lord in the way that you have come to know him and be expand on that base peter white disclaimer none of what be write necessarily reflect a view of my company phil i want to know christ and the power of hi resurrection and the fellowship of share in niv hi suffer become like him in hi death
