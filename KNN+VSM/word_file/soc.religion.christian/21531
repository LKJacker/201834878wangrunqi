own life-journey the idea of johannine hour wa bear in taize a a simple response to all those who be try to assimilate the bible message in the midst of their daily life because of work or study it be often impossible to spend long hour in silence and reflection but everyone can take an hmy from time to time to enter a church sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the wood there in silence we can meditate on a passage of scripture to listen to the voice of christ during the time of silence it be important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worry if in some biblical expression we find it difficult to hear the voice of christ the idea be to communicate to other what we have understand of christ not burden them with my own hesitation but rather tell them what ha bring u joy what ha lead u to run the risk of trust more deeply perhap those who read and think about the johannine hour in thi newsgroup could share their reflection and discovery with other the
