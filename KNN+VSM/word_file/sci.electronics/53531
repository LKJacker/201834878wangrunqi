from vanderby david vanderbyl subject re mysteriou tv problem source llbgb write initial symptom no picture or sound crt filament do not glow flyback tick a describe abovew discovered when hook up the scope if strip be not put out audio or video signal everything be make simple hz pulse horiz out transistor collector case of the be a hz downgoing sawtooth with ca ring at front end guy what s going on here anyone see thi before what be happen be thi you turn the tv on the horizontal output begin normal operation thi power up the high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry a problem be sense and the horizontal oscillator shut down after it power down the cycle repeat thing to check first check for a short high power component ymy best bet be the vertical output transistor s or if there be one the voltage regulator the most common cause of thi type of failure be too much current be draw somewhere also look for shutdown circuit which ymy tv may or may not have if you can find one that be shut down the horizontal oscillator then it should be too hard to find the problem from there
