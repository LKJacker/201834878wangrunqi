from kludge scott dorsey subject re pressure zone microphone in article mpaul marxhausen paul write i remember back before commercial mike with the pzm label for pressure zone microphone start show up i read an article in some engineer journal that describe the principle involve all the physic aside from a practicle standpoint the author say they build a prototype with nothing more than a small sony lavelier mike lay up against a large aluminum disk in demonstrate it at a presentation to audio engineer thi wa impressive enough that the person present be bug them about where they could buy them yup it not all that difficult to do anyway i want to build some to use a choir mike wide coverage i have good luck use some small electret mike element i get from digi-key most of these be limited-bandwidth peakey unit but for a buck or two more i get the one spec to go out to with a bite flatter response the panasonic cartridge be bad but they be spectacular the distance of the mike open from the flat plate be kind of critical i debate whether to mount it on it side which put the open a shade under from the plate or mount it with the open actually point down into the plate at a small clearance i have dissect a unit like you can buy at radio shack to see how they do it thought do mount it on the side call up crown the company that ha the patent on the pzm and ask them for information on construction and use of the thing you may have to determine the correct space emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the design of the panasonic cartridge use a tune cavity in front of the electret element to increase the high frequency response and you be go to be alter the resistance through the cavity entrance crown ha a nice book on the subject though it unfortunately rather short on mathematics there a jae article from many year back too still for ymy application you be a lot better off buy the cheap radio shack model and use phil rastoczny modification to get a clean balance output phil mod seem to get reposted here on a regular basi scott
