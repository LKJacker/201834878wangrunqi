subject re can microwave be used to collect xyz coordinate from ganter robert ganter in article write in article robert g carpenter write it seem reasonable to me that a microwave transmitter-receiver setup could do the job for example say you want to map an acre lot it be convenient to place mw transmitter around the lot periphery either or and then carry a hand-held recorder and walk to a point on the lot pres a button and the coord of the recorder location be store a digital datum what the chance of thi work any system like thi already exist what kind of accuracy could you expect what would something like thi cost to prototype is there a better alternative than microwave of course you could develope thi system but there be already a system call global positioning satellite it gife three dimensional coordinate anywhere on earth many surveyor use thi system with a differential to get coordinate within centimeter basic receiver with resolution of a few meter on a good day be available from many source wmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmwmw weston r beal electrical engineer utah state university that the wonderful thing about crayon they can take you to more place than a starship can guinon thought it mean global positioning system there be two precision level one for army application kill ha to be very accurate today and one for civil one the civil precision be about to correct me if i wrong though it may be insufficiant for map build but there be a way with an additional reference point one fix gp system in a house to get the same high precision a the military version but it get pretty complicate then if you use a microwave system actually thi mean some type of radar you need quite a lot of number crunch to get accurate vectorized datum out of ymy original signal so the gp system seem to be the better and run idea for ymy application there have be discussion in thi newsgroup do know of an addres anymore cheer robert robert ganter universitaet basel i be a fan institut fuer informatik of my plan ganter amateurradio packet
