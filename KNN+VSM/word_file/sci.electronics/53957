from acollin andy collin subject voltage regulation and current limit one not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guy for my clas project we need to design and build a power supply to the follow spec voltatge adjustable from current limit at voltage must stay within of designate value for i from ac ripple le than mv rm of course we ca just use an adjustable voltage current-limiting regulator chip my problem be with the current limit we find stuff to do the rest of the part of the circuit what the supply must do if present with a load which would draw more than give the supply voltage be reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp thu if we be to short the thing with the ammeter we should read one amp if we measure the current through a ohm resistor at we should read one amp and the output voltage by necessity must be the only basic idea we have see for the current limiter involf a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor and therefore reduce the output so do anybody have any idea we could work from thank in advance andy collin acollin p if anybody want to flame thi a a stupid project i agree fully but i still have to do it it grade
