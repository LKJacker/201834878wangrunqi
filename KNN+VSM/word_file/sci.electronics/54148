from myer bob myer subject re switching ps question anyway i build the basic up down converter with pretty good result efficiency but i run into problem when i try to design build anything that put out seriou amp i know it can be do i have some gut on my bench but something puzzle me i use a simple choke a the storage element basicly a toroid with a single wind but all commercial model use transformer with many wind i trace a few and they seem to use some of the wind for the usual but some of the other seem to loose me what be they for better than that anyone have a full schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of i love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such low volume most commercial switcher do not use magnetic for their energy storage that handle by the big cap on the primary side those which in a linearly-regulated power supply would be consider the filter cap come right after the bridge the transformer be just that a transformer it there primarily to step the voltage up or down although the inductance see by the switch transistor on the primary side be not negligible a anyone who zap say transistor from either fail to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglect to include a snubber diode acros it would tell you actually many transistor intend for switcher use today have the diode build in the basic switched-mode power supply operate something like thi in a somewhat simplify manner the ac line be rectify to produce a high voltage more-or-les unregulated dc rail the energy storage or filter cap appear acros thi rail a do the switch transistor the transistor chop the current into the primary side of the transformer result in stepped-up or stepped-down pulse out the secondary which be then rectify and filter at least one of the transformer output be sample and feed back to the control circuit for the switch transistor which act in a pulse-width modulation pwm fashion to control by vary the pulse width the amount of energy be dump into the primary and therefore the voltage come out at the secondary the remain output may be allow to simply run at whatever value they will more-or-les track the regulate output or they may have some additional linear regulation add you may also note that the feedback between the regulate output and the pwm control which be most typically an ic be not do vium a direct electrical connection thi be due to variou safety standard which require primary and secondary circuit to be electrically isolate often the feedback path involf an optoisolator to meet thi requirement while the transformer be the primary energy-storage device in these design thi do not mean that the energy store in the transformer can be ignore beside the inductive kick give the switch transistor a bad time a note above you also need to worry about get all the energy that go in to the transformer back out again one way or another in some design thi happen more or le automatically but in other you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core do saturate which again would have disastrou result best leave to the imagination i not by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer hopefully a real one will come along soon and clean up any gros error in the above bob myer hewlett-packard co opinion express here be not system technology div those of my employer or any other myer fort collin colorado sentient life-form on thi planet
