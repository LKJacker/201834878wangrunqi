from acooney alan cooney subject re lo angele freeway traffic report i live in the san francisco bay area and word ha it that something similar be on it way here since we apparently do have the sensor base you folk have they instal camera at strategic point along the freeway initial test be go to be in the santum clara area i tell with the video be pip into a command center they build somewhere in the east bay i not sure if frame grabber or cheap labor will be use to interpret the datum but large multi-colored statu display will show the variou route use different color to represent the variou average speed for each stretch of highway an announcer will sit in front of the statu and will relay continuou verbal traffic statu to those who want to receive it they apparently also look into license a low-am frequency to be dedicate to provide continuou audio from thi system in the mean time they set up large incandescent display board along the test stretch to provide commuter with datum on traffic condition up ahead my understand be that the system be subsidize a a pilot program and information from it will be available free of charge perhap the la system be similarly free or provide at an obviously subsidize rate read cheap we also have the traffic report that be broadcast on the sap audio channel of television channel and these be verbal report qualify with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receiver like the talk that the information come next be applicable to a give area in la they probably use some other tv channel but the concept be the same try set ymy stereo tv or vcr to receive the sap audio channel and go station jump to find out which one be broadcast thi information i believe thi program be also subsidize make the in-vehicle receiver cheap to purchase and without have to incur monthly fee to use it since the maker of these in-vehicle receiver do have to pay for the broadcast thi may not be completely true they likely have no investment in keep the system up and run when the cal tran stuff hit the airwave you may have a nifty little tv audio receiver in ymy car nothing more when thi happen perhap a word to the wise i think we all be interest in a summary post if you get more info on how the la system be network and pay for cheer alan acooney
