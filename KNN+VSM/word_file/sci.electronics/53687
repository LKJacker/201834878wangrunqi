from jgd john de armond subject re what do nuclear site cooling tower do swalker write i wa wonder about those massive concrete cylinder that be ever present at nuclear poer site they look like cylinder that have be pinch in the middle do anybody know what the actual purpose of those thing be i hear that they call tower but what the heck do they cool i hope someone can help the actual hourglas be hollow and be design to generate a draft exploit the venturus effect around the base of the hourglas be a ring of water tower warm river water come from the steam condenser in the plant be spray over louvre the draft be pull through the tower cool the water by both evaporation and convection the sensible heat extract from the cool water be the drive force for draft generation it should be note that the hourglass-shaped cool tower be use on both fossile and nuclear plant it should also be note that at location where water be plentiful the cool tower be only use part time when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit it wa once think that the warm discharge water wa damage to fish fisherman know that be thoroughly incorrect nontheles stringent usually state regulation remain in some instance since it typically take hp worth of pump to move the volume of water need to cool a mwe plant the cost of use the tower be not insignificant john de armond interested in high performance mobility performance engineering magazine tm interested in high tech and computer mariettum ga send ur snail-mail addres to jgd perform for a free sample mag lee harvey oswald where be ya when we need ya
