from jackb jack brindle subject re can radio freq be used to measure distance in article tgg tom gardner write in robert g carpenter write i wonder if it possible to use radio wave to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver ye it call radar well actually not quite both radar and radio-altimeter measure distance by measure the time require to transmit a signal then receive it reflection from a target radar generally use pulse while radio altimeter use either pulse or a modulate continuous-wave transmission in the case of the latter highly accurate distance measurement can be make a an example the original bendix radio altimeter wa accurate to foot at foot altitude note however that thi be a different method of measure than the poster originally ask about the problem with gain accurate measurement between a transmitter and a seperate receiver be that you need a highly accurate time base which start at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter trigger thi can not be wire connect since radio wave will actually travel faster in free-space air in thi case than wire the difference be call the velocity factor of the cable so you need to resort to a common timebase that be automatically correct for distance etc something like a pll connect to a gp receiver should do the trick trigger both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously sound expensive not too bad but plan on spend a few buck in both equipment and effort why not go to a different method surveyor use a laser-light system where again the reflection time be measure why not try thi sound like something a should know about anyway seem to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance thi would be for short distance ft and i would need to have accuracy of inch or so thi be actually highly inaccurate since the power output of a transmitter vary from unit to unit there be variance in the antenna and transmission line and the receiver may also vary both from unit to unit and the same unit over time you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system with the radio altimeter thi be also do but since everything be locate at one place it be much easier to do note especially that the time base for the receiver and transmitter be one unit also depend on the environment in a static environent such a a waveguide ye in a dynamic environment with object move about the multipath kill thi concept nope fm capture effect say that the strongest signal win that be unles the two interfere signal be seperated by more than db in signal strength thi be the one problem that make altimeter inaccurate at very low altitude signal bounce off runway tend to be very strong what frequency would be best for thi or do matter a high a possible to eliminate outside influence and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signal radio altimeter typically use frequency around ghz hope thi help jack brindle ham radio internet jackb
