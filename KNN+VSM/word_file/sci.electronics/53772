from jott john ott subject re pinout need for in article segal gary segal write i recently pick up some display chip but i ca find any information on them it seem they be no longer make by ti and i do have an old enough datum book it appear to have a dot-matrix lead display capable of show one hex digit it be in a pin dip package but pin and be not present if you have any information on thi part pinout power requirment function please send me e-mail thank you gary segal motorola inc segal cellular infrastructure division we be stand here only to gaze at the wind pin function lead supply voltage latch datum input b latch datum input a leave decimal point cathode latch strobe input omit common gnd blank input omit right decimal point cathode omit latch datum input d latch datum input c logic supply voltage latch strobe input pin when low the datum in the latch follow the datum on the latch datum input when high the datum in the latch will not change if the display be blank and then restore while the enable input be high the previou character will again be display blanking input pin when high the display be blank regardles of the level of the other input when low a character be display a determine by the datum in the latch the blank input may be pulse for intensity modulation latch datum input pin datum on these input be enter into the latch when the enable input be low the binary weight of these input be a b c d decimal point cathode pin these led be not connect to the logic chip if a decimal point be use an external resistor or other current limit mechanism must be connect in series with it led supply pin thi connection permit the user to save on regulate vcc current by use a separate led supply or it may be externally connect to the logic supply vcc logic supply vcc pin separate vcc connection for the logic chip common ground pin thi be the vegative termnal for all logic and led current except for the decimal point john jott
