from dave dave martindale subject re a question about outlet wire jeh write hmmm how be those orange isolate grind outlet often use in computer room wire they require two separate grind one grind go to the grind pin of the outlet and the other grind wire be connect to the outlet mount tab and thu grind the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate if any the grind go to the normal distribution panel grind the outlet ground-pin wire be generally connect to an insulate busbar in the distribution panel which be in turn connect to the building-entrance main grind by it own wire so the two separate grind system be connect together at the build service entrance but one be also connect to every ground piece of electrical equipment in the whole build while the isolate grind be share only by the equipment plug into isolated-ground outlet of that panel if someone happen to accidentally short one phase of a feeder to grind the main build grind be likely to have a lot of noise on it until the breaker trip or the fuse blow while the isolate grind will remain relatively noise-free
