from subject re ir remote control receiver in article duane p mantick write marc dion write for a project of my own i would like to build a infra-red remote control receiver for regular vcr and tv remote do anybody have any info or tip on how to build such receiver in particular a which photo detector should i use which wavelength do remote use b which ics or circuit should i use c any suggestion for circuit layout another suggestion find a brand of tv that use an ir remote and go look at the sam photofact for it you can often find some very detail schematic and part list for not only the receiver but the transmitter a well include carrier freq spec and tone decode spec if the system use that probably wo help i be will to bet that every manufacturer use those little self-contained module i think sharp make them radio shack use to sell them for a few buck maybe they still do the module have lead power grind and demodulate output it contain the photo-detector amplifier integrator and demodulator all in a tiny metal can if you want to buy one try radio shack or else a tv repair shop can probably order one btw the carrier frequency be khz and each different manufacturer use a unique pulse scheme to perform each different function on their equipment jim ritterbusch or temp rf there be an art the guide say or rather a knack to fly the knack ly in learn how to throw yourself at the grind and mi
