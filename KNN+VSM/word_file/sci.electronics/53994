from g stewart beal subject re can radio freq be used to measure distance in article robert g carpenter write i wonder if it possible to use radio wave to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver seem to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance thi would be for short distance ft and i would need to have accuracy of inch or so thi would be susceptible to fade multi-path etc we use to use a system at the shop make by tellurometer in south africa it use a ghz signal between unit acros the distance to be measure the ghz wa just the carrier the real signal be several switch one around mhz or so whose relative phase at the receiver would read out the digit of the distance down to cm if need the unit come with psychrometer sp to measure the relative humidity and instruction for correction of the measurement due to rh and temp they be rather heavy and require an operator at each end current technology use polarize reflector dual polaization and psuedo-random cod of a radar pulse about the same resolution at x band much better at only one end be heavy regard stu beal national water research institute burlington ontario canada we make it through yet another nuclear winter and the lawn have just trap and eat it first robin kyle j spiller
