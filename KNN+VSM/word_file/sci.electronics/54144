from kolstad joel kolstad subject re blue led in article gladman gladman aviv write in order to emit blue light a semiconductor must have a band gap energy within the region of to electron volt according to my physical electronic prof you ca get an led with that band gap that why you do find blue led or for that matter some other colmy of led that be not to say that blue led ca be find i see led sell but they be just ymy typical visible light led in a blue plastic cover they do emit very much light um ymy professor if just plain wrong although blue led be one heck of a lot le efficient than red one typical visible light led do really exist led have a fairly narrow region of transmittence since the fermi energy around either side of the band gap fall off exponentially blah blah source solid state electronic device ben g streetman ed prentice hall you might want to check the copyright date on that blue led most certainly do exist i get a bunch at work cree research make them probably along with other company cree be big in material science though they advertise in the stuff like physic today etc you can buy them from jameco i think digikey definitely and plenty of other distributor actually these day you can get a typical visible light led it call a rainbow led and i forget who make it they advertise in edn and many of the other trade rag though it combine a reg green and blue led all on one chip and ha fmy lead nifty device although it probably fairly expensive joel kolstad
