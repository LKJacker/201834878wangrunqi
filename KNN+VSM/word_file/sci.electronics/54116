from neal neal howard subject re lead acid battery concrete in article mcovingt michael covington write in article carter ame write why do a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when store on a concrete floor i decide to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage thi year to preserve them and i just go to use them and notice that not only do they not work but they act like the two terminal be short i ask a friend and he say that you should never do that it ruin them but he could tell me why thi topic wa beat to death a year or so ago the concrete be not the problem lead-acid battery often fail from disuse not be charge for a long time but there no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the problem the concrete floor accelerate the problem because it be a heat sink and a colder lead-acid battery self-discharge at a slightly faster rate that why the old wife tale of sit it on a piece of wood on the floor work to help keep from kill the battery a fast it insulate the battery thermally it you set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam it will self-discharge even slower the best thing would be to attach a small load such a a small transistor radio with the volume turn down low and leave it on constantly but also trickle-charge it every couple day too to shallow cycle the charge in the battery such mild exercise of a lead-acid battery be the next best thing to completely remove the electrolyte for storage if you do remove the electrolyte may sure you keep separate storage container for each cell electrolyte and put it back into the same cell when you refill the battery thi be so critical for a brand-new battery in a fully charge state but will maximize the restore output of an older battery which may not be fully charge when you remove the electrolyte for storage neal howard dod computrac inc richardson tx doh neal std disclaimer my opinion be mine not computrac let u learn to dream gentleman and then perhap we shall learn the truth august kekule
