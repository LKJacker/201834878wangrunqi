from shorty david haag subject re pink noise in article david sharpe write pink noise and white noise be equal amount of all frequency thi be in most case around the hz range be use to adjust for room dynamic and stuff like that there be a few eq out on the market that have pink noise build in most all from audio control have them i know the do with regard to what you write how do one adjust for room dynamic and stuff like that i ask a professor that question just last week and he do really know himself since pink noise be believe to be due to surface state say the surface of the silicon where there a lack of a covalent bond that act a trap to nearby elecron and since thi happen at low frequency because at high frequency they be able to trap electron how do you compensate for that it seem to me that you would be able to compensate for pink noise i have see the pink noise feature however on many eq and i wa wonder how they be suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise be not due to man make noise like power line crosstalk couple etc if you have any information about thi it would be appreciate hope thi do sound too draw out thanx david shorty
