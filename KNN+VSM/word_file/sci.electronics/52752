from whit john whitmore subject re wire wrap question again in article pascal pascal goguey write in article macfitz mark d fitzsimmo write after a considerable amount of research review of discussion on thi group and mainly fruitles time on breadboard i have decide that the path of least resistance for prototyping my not necessarily someone else electronic design be wire wrap i have no idea about what you want to do but be careful wire wrap increase a lot the wire capacitance that should be a problem for slow application a few mhz but a for quicker one around mhz i doubt that it can work fortunately wire-wrapping be a better wire technique than most at high frequency cray computer up to the x-mp at least all have wirewrapped backplane wirewrap get into trouble at much higher frequency than any ttl can handle the of wire capacitance be not really relevant you have to use transmission line technique and the capacitance be no problem where can i get a decent wrap tool i like to spend le than for an ac power unit include bite and sleeve hand power be the best there be good ac power one but rather expensive a low-cost one do work very well hand-powered be a terrible choice imho unles you be a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connection at a time ymy hand will cramp battery-powered wire-wrap gun be available in the range and so be the little twiddle-stick manual type for a modest project of a couple hundred connection i prefer to borrow a professional ac unit or a pneumatic one john whitmore
