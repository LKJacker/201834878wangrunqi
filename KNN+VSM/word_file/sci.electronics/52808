from richard o white subject re help with ultra-long time in article wellison du write i have a project that wa droop in my lap that be somewhat a pain to design what i be look for be a stable ultra-long solid state timer what they want to do be to place thi thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six week every two week they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different color pellet by ga pressure out acros the snow then by dig down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measure a they come to the different color pellet the problem be try to build a timer that would stand the cold degree and a power source that would drain i have look at the timer and the standard dual timer but thier temp spec wo go that low also two week equate to second per fire which mean one big time cap i have find farad ye farad cap that have a work voltage of volt and be small in size but again the time of discharge at or lower degree be linear i wa think of use several timer chain together to fire the selonid at the end of the time period but that blast cold and the drain on a battery over six week be the pain one possibility would be to use solar panel but thi be during the six month twilight anyone have any good idea thank in advance we just a suggestion take a motorola set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten sec with either a rc or xtal clock input then fee to a a clock input and decode output for sec output might have to add a few gate or decoder chip to get output and reset pulse back to to restart cycle trigger a oneshot from the decode rise edge the one shoot then go to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher these ckt require uamp of current between volt so a volt gel cell of a few amphour would last the six week then take the ckt board battery wrap in or of foam or build a box of out of the stuff with plywood or metal exterior build a small heater out of watt resistor in series to keep the battery and ckt warm think use battery one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger insolate-insolate even though the chip state that the al rat device be good to c the battery have a considerable reduction in capacity oh make sure the area inside ha minium air leakage hope thi help rw be thi to long wind for the net be gentle
