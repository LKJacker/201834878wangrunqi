from umlangston mark c langston subject negative logic high thi may sound like a simple-minded question but thi be the first time i ever have a need for thi i be design some relatively simple chip circuit base on thing like photoresistor you know no light to photoresistor emit a logic high etc anyway i get some servo lie around and i want to do some thing with them use digital logic i know all about have to pulse the signal and everything i just have one problem i assume i need a negative ye negative logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high is a negative logic high i see thi in schematic the same thing a an active low or what i not use a bi-polar power source so how would i get a negative logic high out of thi thing i need to have all three signal available logic high logic low and negative logic high any help would be greatly appreciate also please reply vium email a i never seem to have time to read thi or any other group lately thank much mark umlangston
