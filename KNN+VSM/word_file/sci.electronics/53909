from whit john whitmore subject re suggestion on audio relay in article billq billy quinn write i build a little project use the radio shack relay to switch audio i get pretty bad when the thing switch is there a good circuit that i can use for switch audio so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio line with relay alone you will alway get a transient when you abruptly turn on or off any channel if you do want to hear the transient use some other device a photoresistor-output optoisolator be the usual sort of thing to gently mute the signal then switch then remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator it use to be standard practice to employ photoresistor in switch audio because the photoresistor time delay a few thousandth of a second keep any noise in the digital side which drife the lamp from contaminate the audio and the device be cheaper than relay john whitmore
