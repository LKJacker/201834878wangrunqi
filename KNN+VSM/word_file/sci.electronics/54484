from gsulliva glenn a sullivan subject re long distance ir detection jvanne write i design and build hardware in that would output a logic level from a tone detector upon detect a microwatt led foot away used a motorola bias linearly in a dc-feedback loop to servo out variation in sunlight and from light used no lens allen sullivan i would be interest in know more about the sense hardware what do you use for the detector could you detect the angle of location or do the system simply respond to the presence of the transmitter in the sensor field of view phototransistor with limiter feedback to base to control operate point i expect thi really hurt noise figure any comment from phototransistor expert we intend to use thi atop a stepper motor to provide head to the beacon the plan wa to have or beacon of different frequency in each room and tell the what frequency to phase-lock to we do not do so one challenge wa that the available stepper have degree step knowing the head to each beacon we would have use the surveyor technique of resection to determine robot location no i ai go to explain resection over the net given hindsight i would digitize the amplify output of the self-nulling phototransistor circuit and correlate in-phase quadrature square-wave at the several expect frequency to extract amplitude of each beacon by do thi at the numerou step even with degree step with knowledge of the angular response of the phototransistor you should be able to rather more accurately determine the head to each beacon allen sullivan
