from dino tony stewart subject re making up odd resistor value require by filter idh ian hawkin write when construct active filter odd value of resistor be often require something like a k ohm resistor it seem best to choose common capacitor value and cope with the strange resistance then demand is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance give fix resistor of the standard value per decade etc it be a common enough problem yet i cant recall see a program that tell that gife rq start with q and find prefer value x y and z cheer ian h when try to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than you need a trimmer or to screen device it ca be make from add resitor of value in parallel since the smaller device will have the error of to cope with you have choice a live with the error of tolerance device for low q circuit or low sensitivity design b buy resistor with better than tolerance c use trimmer or sot select-on-test dino the inquiring mind bb winnipeg manitoba
