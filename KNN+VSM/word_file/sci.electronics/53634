from pmalenfa paul malenfant subject optoisolator interfacing question i be interfacing some simple circuit that run on to my cpu board which run at the optoisolator be a on the lead side i put the signal i want through a resistor to the base of a on the transistor side i tie my cpu input line to the collector which ha a pull-up resistor of it function ok but seem very slow i can detect pulse that occur at about but not much faster is the time of thi device something like i should be able to detect my target of but i ca get thi be do use wire-wrap and the wire go to the cpu and to the test pin be about inch long but i not do anything high-speed in the art of electronic it mention tie the base of the phototransistor to grind through a resistor to improve the speed is that what i need to do how do i calculate the resistor value paul malenfant pmalenfa
