from cab chri best subject re need help with car stereo just a shoot here but ya never know i once buy a real cheap equalizer power amp for my car tape player at one of those motel-room truckload sale and it sound great for a while that be then one channel quit entirely i open it up and the amplifier chip for the bad channel have simply melt some of it solder joint attach it to the pcb i solder them back and it work fine i just have to keep the volume a bite lower than i do before probably lousy heat sink you say a nice alpine which i sure be a few order of mag higher in quality than the i have but the point be look inside before you scrap it since you occasionally find something you can repair maybe even the same thing i find good luck
