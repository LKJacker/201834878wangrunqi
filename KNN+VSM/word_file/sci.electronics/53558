from leek subject re adc card for computer in article you say i would like to digitize the output of a squid magnetometer range v to v and do digital signal process in a computer say a macintosh ius or a pc i would like a good bite adc with good linearity and a high conversion speed at least khz preferably khz other concern must i use an adc external to my computer to avoid digital noise feedback into my sensitive squid electronic might be a good idea the resolution you request be about in order to get what you pay for noise level better be lower than that it be kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a pc before you pay for a pc card test it out by sample a low distortion sine wave i think there be a sine wave on a cd digital domain there be possibly other low thd source run the digitize waveform through a fft transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum that should give you a good indication of the design that what i be do to test a datum acquistion system i have design i get the idea from maxim datum sheet if you can live with bite resolution i would recommend look at the from maxim it be a high speed complete sample with dsp interface the input range be and it use a serial interface which can easily be optically isolate from the computer to elinimate a major noise source the analog design guide i get from them show a noise level they claim a max typ thd look pretty good for the piece a evaluation kit be available might want to give these nice folk a call or fax and for application assistance thi assume that you can build ymy own da and write ymy own software hey you can get the a a free sample just by call the i would appreciate discussion of ymy personal experience with a mac or pc base adc system i would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be get out of ymy system by look at the noise level otherwise you might be throw out ymy money charle cunningham cec k c lee elec eng grad student i have no connection with maxim except i do in general recommend company that give sample to student to other i feel they deserve that for be nice to me
