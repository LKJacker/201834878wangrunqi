from kolstad joel kolstad subject re oversampling cd player in article hcb h c bowman write hello i just buy a new portable cd player for the office and i notice that it proudly proclaim time oversampling on the box now while i think i understand what oversampling be the rate of discrete sample exceed the highest frequency component of interest by some factor i do understand thi time busines it seem to me that when i buy my first cd player wa it really year ago the spec say time could someone please tell me whether i get senile if i not then what good do it do for the player to take sample at a higher rate if i really want better fidelity would i have to have the same higher rate of sample during the record proces furthermore be i wrong in interpret the sample rate from the player point of view a be the same thing a the datum rate for the bite stream come off the optical medium do thi mean that the datum rate relate to the rotational speed of the disk ha change since note i just try to figure thi stuff out about a month ago myself from variou person on the net so i could be wrong the datum be only ever read once bar mistrack and such of course and eventually get turn into khz bite two channel datum oversampling take two discrete datum point and interpolate point between them for n time oversampling when i ask person say that the interpolation wa not simply linear interpolation but significantly more complicate anyway then the purpose of oversampling be to move the effective sample rate up to n time khz in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filter for the same quality filter higher oversampling let you build cheaper filter wherea for the same price filter higher oversampling let you build better filter so assume the quality of all other component in a cd player remain the same oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to anti-alia filter joel kolstad
