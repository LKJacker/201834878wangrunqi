from schaerer thoma schaerer subject re voltage regulation and current limit andy collin acollin write one not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guy for my clas project we need to design and build a power supply to the follow spec voltatge adjustable from current limit at voltage must stay within of designate value for i from ac ripple le than mv rm to decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of the limiter-current and the allow temp-drift in the first case you can use a ube of a transistor a a voltage-reference of about vdc with a temp-drift of in the second case it better you use a bandgap-ref and a opamp-circuit to detect the maximum-current the output of thi opamp controll the outputstage to limit the current bye thoma
