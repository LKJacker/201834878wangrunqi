from et eric h taylor subject hole practical question wa philosophical question in article jac jim carr write i agree i come at thi from nuclear physic where one often discus particle-hole excitation and certain reaction have the effect of apply an annihilation operator and create a hole and it be a subtle question the longer one work with them the more real they become there be also quasi-particle which raise the same sort of question about how real the entity be the phenomenon be most certainly a real one ok i ask thi before and with a new thread on these line i ask thi again if a large hole current be run thru a resistor will there be r cool instead of heat can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplify hole current over normal electron current what semiconductor material have the highest ratio of hole mobility to electron mobility please quote actual test sample rather than estimate base on theory also do be limit to semiconductor consider also insulator resistor dielectric piezo-electric conductor magnet metal ceramic magnetostrictive etc note to summarize thi thread ha so far state that the only area where hole be not detectable be the vacuum that be hole particle only exist in the presence of matter previou thread have state that hole only exist in certain semi-conductor the question that naturally arise be if the hole current inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point where the semiconductor be join to a conductor say copper i do want a theoretical discussion here about whether hole could exist inside metal conductor rather i ask for an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such current if they exist also note that i have cross-posted thi to since thi be now become an electronic discussion thanx eric et a force of nature
