from kolstad joel kolstad subject re how to the disk copy protect in article guido kleman write stuff about hardware key if you put another computer on the port instead of the key you can hack them by read what happen so i be tell i never see thi do but i think it possible you need some hardware knowledge and some software to read the port true which be why many of the newer key ship out oh maybe bite or so have the key encrypt them and return them to the pc making a bunch of these bite part of ymy program code be a good way to make sure thing wo run without the key anyway then thi scheme at least defeat ymy approach it a little costly though personally i do believe in copy protection and agree with the think that the ma inconvenience that it cause all legal user far outweigh the gain from what few pirate wo be able to copy the program joel kolstad
