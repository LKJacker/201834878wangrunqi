substantively change answer note that thi be now a register faq cross-posted to and should appear in the faq list of list subject question answer in thi faq what be the nec where can i get a copy what be the cec where can i get a copy can i do my own wire extra pointer what do i need in the way of tool what be ul list what be csa approval are there any cheaper easier to read book on wire inspection how and what why should i get my wire inspect my house do meet some of these rule and regulation a word on voltage what do an electrical service look like what be a circuit ground versu ground versu neutral what do a fuse or breaker do what be the difference breaker ca i use fuse what size wire should i use where do these number come from what do mean what be a wirenut marrette marr connector how be they use what be a where should gfci be use where should i use a gfcus what be the difference between a gfcus outlet and a gfcus breaker what the purpose of the grind prong on an outlet then why be one prong wider than the other polarization what kind of outlet do i need in a kitchen where must outlet and switch be in bathroom what be what be bx when should i use each should i use plastic or metal box junction box position can i install a replacement fixture what do it mean when the light brighten when a motor start what be phase power should i use it can i get it in my house is it better to run motor at or what be thi nonsense about on circuit how do i convert two prong receptacle to three prong are you sure about gfci and ungrounded outlet should the test button work how should i wire my shop underground wire aluminum wire i buy a house what should i do what be thi weird stuff old style wire where do i buy stuff subject although we do a fair bite of wire we be not electrician and we can not be responsible for what you do if you at all uncertain about what be correct or safe do do it contact someone qualify a license electrician or ymy local electrical inspector electricity be no joke mistake can result in shock fire or electrocution furthermore my discussion be base on the national electrical code nec and the canadian electrical code cec to the best of my ability we have confirm every detail with the electrical code but we do quote section simply to keep thi thing readable if you think we wrong we invite you to correct u but please quote reference the nec and the cec do not in and of themself have the force of law many municipality adopt it en toto other however do not check ymy with ymy local build department and provincial hydro inspection office in canada to find out what apply in ymy area also ymy local electrical utility may also have special requirement for electrical service installation bear in mind too that we say here apply primarily to ordinary single-family residence multi-family dwell mobile home commercial establishment etc be sometime govern by different rule also note that contrary to popular belief in the and in some part of canada canada be not a wholly-owned subsidiary of the consequently the nec do not apply in canada lot of thing be the same include voltage line frequency and the law of physic but there be a number of crucial difference in the regulation where we can we note them flag the relevant passage with nec or cec remember that the cec and nec be minimal standard it be often smart to go beyond their minimal requirement subject what be the nec where can i get a copy the nec be a model electrical code devise and publish by the national fire protection association an insurance industry group it revise every three year the version ha be release you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by call them directly at the code exist in several version there the full text which be fairly incomprehensible there an abridge edition which ha only the section likely to apply to most house and there the nec handbook which contain the authorize commentary on the code a well a the full text that the recommend version unfortunately there no handbook for the abridge edition and the full handbook be expensive u plu ship and handle subject what be the cec where can i get a copy the canadian standard association be an organization make up of variou government agency power utility insurance company electrical manufacturer and other organization the csa publish csa standard which be update every two or three year each province adopt with some amendment thi standard and publish a province-specific code book since each province publish it own slightly modify standard it would be somewhat confuse to obtain the csa standard itself in thi faq cec really mean the appropriate provincial standard in particular thi faq be derive from the ontario hydro electrical safety code edition which be in turn base on csa edition while difference exist between the province an attempt ha be make to avoid specific-to-ontario detail the appropriate provincial code can be obtain from electrical inspection office of ymy provincial power authority in ontario it ontario hydro the ontario hydro book be overly fat it about c and include mail update i hear that these standard be somewhat easier to read than the equivalent nec publication do bother ask in quebec diy wire be ban throughout the province subject can i do my own wire extra pointer in most place homeowner be allow to do their own wire in some they not check with ymy local electrical inspector most place wo permit you to do wire on other home for money without a license nor be you permit to do wire in commercial build multiple dwell eg duplex be usually consider semi-commercial or commercial however many jurisdiction will permit you to work on semi-commercial wire if you supervise by a license electrician if you can find one will to supervise if you do ymy own wire an important point do it neat and well what you really want to aim for be a better job than an electrician will do after all it ymy own home and it you or ymy family that might get kill if you make a mistake an electrician ha time pressure ha the skill and know the trick of the trade to do a fast safe job in thi faq we consciously give a few recommendation that be in exces of code because we feel that it reasonable and will impres the inspector the inspector will know that you an amateur you have to earn hi trust the best way of do thi be to spend ymy time do a neat a job a possible do cut corner exceed specification otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgression do try to hide anything from the inspector use the proper tool ie do use a bread knife to strip wire or twist wire with ymy finger the inspector wo like it and the result wo be that safe and it take longer and you more likely to stick a hunk of wire through ymy hand that way do handle house wire when it very cold eg below or thermoplastic house wire particularly older type become very brittle subject what do i need in the way of tool first there the obviou a hammer a drill a few screwdriver both straight and phillips-head if you lucky enough to live in canada or find a source of csa-approved device you need robertson square reces screwdriver and instead of phillip for drill a few hole a or spade bite and or electric drill will do if you do a lot or be work with elderly lumber we recommend a drill right-angle drill be wonderful can be rent and or screw-point auger drill bite these bite pull you through so they much faster and le fatigue even in year old hardwood timber screw-driver bite be useful for drill expecially if you install ymy electrical box use screw drywall screw work well for strip wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire cutter do buy the k-mart combo stripper crimper and bottle opener type you should expect to pay to for a good plier-type pair it will have size strip hole and wo nick or grab the wire it should be easy to strip wire with it one model ha a small hole in the blade for form exact wire loop for screw terminal there be fancier type but they generally be necessary and pro usually do use them a pair of diagonal side cutter plier be useful for clip end in constrict place do use these for strip wire you will need linesman plier for twist wire for wire nut you should have a pair of needle-nose plier for fiddle inside box and close loop but it better to form wire loop with a loop former hole on ymy wire stripper more accurate if you use non-metallic cable get a cable stripper for remove the sheath or do what some pro do they nick the end of the sheath grab the grind wire with a pair of plier and simply rip the sheath back use the grind wire a a zipper and cut the sheath off you should try to strip the sheath with a knife point because it too easy to slash the insulation on the conductor apparently stanley utility knife fit with linoleum cutter hook blade can be use to strip sheath but there be still the possibility that you gouge the conductor for any substantial amount of work with armor cable it well worth ymy while to invest in a rotary cable splitter u hack saw be tricky to use without cut into the wire or the insulation three-prong outlet tester be a quick check for properly-wired outlet about multimeter tell you more but be a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most person a simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulate wire not supply any device be extremely helpful they cost about u at radio shack you should have a voltage detector to check that the wire be dead before do work on them neon-bulb version be cheap and work well if you get more seriou a audible alarm type be good for trace circuit without a helper though i be know to lock the drill on and hit breaker until the scream stop for run wire through exist wall you need fish tape often two tape be need though sometime a bend hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice fish tape can be rent electrical tape lot of it seriously a good and competent wire job will need very little tape the tape be useful for wrap dicy insulation in repair work another use be to wrap around the body of outlet and switch to cover the termination screw i do do thi but drywall contractor prefer it to prevent explosion when the drywall knife collide with a live outlet that ha no cover plate subject what be ul list the ul stand for underwriter laboratory it use to be an insurance industry organization but now it be independent and non-profit it test electrical component and equipment for potential hazard when something be ul-listed that mean that the ul ha test the device and it meet their requirement for safety ie fire or shock hazard it do necessarily mean that the device actually do what it suppose to just that it probably wo kill you the ul do not have power of law in the you be permit to buy and install non-ul-listed device however insurance policy sometime have clause in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim make in response to the failure of a non-ul-listed device furthermore in many situation the nec will require that a wire component use for a specific purpose be ul-listed for that purpose indirectly thi mean that certain part of ymy wire must be ul-listed before an inspector will approve it occupancy permit issue subject what be csa approval every electrical device or component must be certify by the canadian standard association before it can be sell in canada implicit in thi be that all wire must be do with csa-approved material they perform test similar to the ul a bite more stringent except that csa approval be require by law again like the ul if a fire wa cause by non-csa-approved equipment ymy insurance company may not have to pay the claim in canada there be a branch organization of the ul call ulc ul of canada ulc do not have power of law and seem to be more a liason group between the csa and insurance company subject are there any cheaper easier to read book on wire usa the follow three book be suggest by my reader residential wiring by jeff markell craftsman book carlsbad ca for isbn practical electrical wiring residential farm and industrial based on the national electrical code herbert p richter and w creighton schwan mcgraw-hill book co wiring simplified h p richter and w c schwan park publishing co try to make sure that the book be base on the latest nec revision which be currently canada knight author and publish a book call electrical code simplified there appear to be a version publish specific to each province and be very tie into the appropriate provincial code it focuse on residential wire and be indispensible for canadian it be better to get thi book than the cec unles you do a lot of wire or answer question on the net it be update each time the provincial code be thi book be available at all diy and hardware store for le than c subject inspection how and what why should i get my wire inspect most jurisdiction require that you obtain a permit and inspection of any wire that be do amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reason like insurance company not like to have to pay claim a permit and inspection provide some assurance that you ymy family ymy neighbor or subsequent owner of ymy home do get kill or lose their home one night due to a sloppy wire job most jurisdiction have the power to order you to vacate ymy home or order you to tear out any wire do without a permit californium for instance be particularly nasty about thi if fire start in ymy home and un-inspected wire be at fault insurance company will often refuse to pay the damage claim in general the proces go like thi you apply to ymy local inspection office or build department for a permit you should have a sketch or detail draw of what you plan on do thi be a good time to ask question on any thing you not sure of if you do major work they may impose special condition on you require load calculation and ask other question at thi point they will tell you which inspection you will need if you instal a main panel you will need to have the panel and service connection inspect before ymy power utility will provide a connection thi be sometime do by the local power authority rather than the usual inspector after instal the box and wire but before the go up you will need a rough-in inspection after the wall be up and the wire be complete you will need a final inspection subject my house do meet some of these rule and regulation do i have to upgrade in general there be no requirement to upgrade older dwell though there be some exception ie smoke detector in some case however any new work must be do accord to the latest electrical code also if you do major work you may be require to upgrade certain exist portion or all of ymy system check with ymy local electrical inspector subject a word on voltage one thing where thing might get a bite confuse be the different number person bandy about for the voltage of a circuit one person might talk about another or another these be all in fact exactly the same thing in north america the utility company be require to supply a split-phase volt fee to ymy house thi work out a two leg additionally since there be resistive voltage drop in the house wire it not unreasonable to find ha drop to or ha drop to by the time the power reach a wall outlet especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run for a number of reason some historical some simple personal ornerynes different person choose call them by slightly different number thi faq ha choose to be consistent with call them and except when actually say what the measure voltage will be confusing a bite just ignore it one thing that might make thi a little more understandable be that the nameplate on equipment ofen show the lower ie instead of value what thi imply be that the device be design to operate properly when the voltage drop that low be not the same a be the voltage between phase of a y circuit that be from neutral to any hot be the voltage between phase of a y circuit that from hot to neutral in keep with versu strangenes motor intend to run on three phase be often label a subject what do an electrical service look like there be logically fmy wire involve with supply the main panel with power three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire come from elsewhere the bare wire be connect to one or more long metal bar pound into the grind or to a wire bury in the foundation or sometime to the water supply pipe ha to be metal continuou to where the main water pipe enter the house watch out for galvanic action conductivity break often between copper and iron pipe thi be the ground conductor it be there to make sure that the third prong on ymy outlet be connect to grind thi wire normally carry no current one of the other wire will be white or black with white or yellow stripe or sometime simply black it be the neutral wire it be connect to the centre tap cec center tap in the nec of the distribution transformer supply the power it be connect to the ground conductor in only one place often inside the panel the neutral and grind should not be connect anywhere else otherwise weird dangerou thing may happen furthermore there should only be one ground system in a home some code require more than one ground electrode these will be connect together or connect to the neutral at a common point still one ground system adding additional ground electrode connect to other portion of the house wire be unsafe and contrary to code if you add a subpanel the grind and neutral be usually bring a separate conductor from the main panel and be not connect together in the subpanel ie still only one neutral-ground connection however in some situation certain category of separate build you actually do have to provide a second ground electrode consult ymy inspector the other two wire will usually be black and be the hot wire they be attach to the distribution transformer a well the two black wire be degree out of phase with each other thi mean if you connect something to both hot wire the voltage will be volt if you connect something to the white and either of the two black you will get some panel seem to only have three wire come into them thi be either because the neutral and grind be connect together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire be do dual-duty a both neutral and grind or in some rare occasion the service ha only one hot wire only service subject what be a circuit inside the panel connection be make to the incoming wire these connection be then use to supply power to select portion of the home there be three different combination one hot one neutral and grind circuit two hot no neutral and grind circuit two hot neutral and grind circuit neutral two circuit with a common neutral be use for most circuit supply receptacle and light within ymy house be usually use for supply power to major appliance such a stave and dryer they often have need for both and or for bring several circuit from the panel box to a distribution point be usually for special motor circuit electric heater or air conditioner note in the u the nec frequently permit a circuit similar to be use for stave and dryer namely that there be two hot wire and a wire that do dual duty a neutral and grind and be connect to the frame a well a provide the neutral for purpose three prong plug instead of fmy only for connect to the main panel when connect to most sub-panel prong plug and receptacle be require in my not-so-humble opinion thi be crazy but the nfpa claim that thi practice wa re-evaluated for the nec and find to be safe check ymy local code or inquire a to local practice there be restriction on when thi be permissible be usually wire with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for ground and have one hot wire colour red the other black a bare wire for ground and in a white wire for neutral you will sometime see wire with just a black white and grind wire since the white be hot in thi case both the nec and cec require that the white wire be permanently mark at the end to indicate that it be a live wire usually do with paint nail polish or sometime electrical tape each circuit be attach to the main wire come into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse there be in a few locale circuit that look like or except that they have two bare grind wire some place require thi for hot tub and the like one grind be frame grind the other attach to the motor thi may or may not be an alternative to gfcus protection subject ground versu ground versu neutral according to the terminology in the cec and nec the ground conductor be for the safety grind the green or bare wire the word neutral be reserve for the white when you have a circuit with more than one hot wire since the white wire be connect to neutral and the ground conductor inside the panel the proper term be ground conductor however the potential confusion between ground conductor and ground conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistake you should never use the bare wire a a ground conductor or white wire a the ground conductor even though they be connect together in the panel but not in subpanel subpanel be feed neutral and grind separately from the main panel usually in the trade and in common usage the word neutral be use for ground conductor thi faq use neutral simply to avoid potential confusion we recommend that you use neutral too thu the white wire be alway except in some light switch application neutral not grind subject what do a fuse or breaker do what be the difference fuse and circuit breaker be design to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceed safe level for example if ymy toaster short out a fuse or breaker should trip protect the wire in the wall from melt a such fuse and breaker be primarily intend to protect the wire ul or csa approval supposedly indicate that the equipment itself wo cause a fire fuse contain a narrow strip of metal which be design to melt safely when the current exceed the rat value thereby interrupt the power to the circuit fuse trip relatively fast which can sometime be a problem with motor which have large startup current surge for motor circuit you can use a time-delay fuse one brand be fusetron which will avoid trip on momentary overload a fusetron look like a spring-loaded fuse a fuse can only trip once then it must be replace breaker be fairly complicate mechanical device they usually consist of one spring load contact which be latch into position against another contact when the current flow through the device exceed the rat value a bimetallic strip heat up and bend by bend it trip the latch and the spring pull the contact apart circuit breaker behave similarly to fusetron that be they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overload than ordinary fuse with high overload they trip quickly breaker can be reset a finite number of time each time they trip or be throw when the circuit be in use some arc take place which damage the contact thu breaker should not be use in place of switch unles they be specially list for the purpose neither fuse nor breaker limit the current per se a dead short on a circuit can cause hundred or sometime even thousand of ampere to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe damage subject breaker ca i use fuse statistic show that fuse panel have a significantly higher risk of cause a fire than breaker panel thi be usually due to the fuse be loosely screw in or the contact corrode and heat up over time or the wrong size fuse be instal or the proverbial replace the fuse with a penny trick since breaker be more permanently instal and have better connection mechanism the risk of fire be considerably le fuse be prone to explode under extremely high overload when a fuse explode the metallic vapor cloud become a conduct path result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melt service wire through fire in the electrical distribution transformer and have ymy house burn down breaker do do thi many jurisdiction particularly in canada no longer permit fuse panel in new installation the nec do permit new fuse panel in some rare circumstance require the special insert to key the fuseholder to specific size fuse some device notably certain large air conditioner require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel the fuse be there to protect the motor wind from overload check the label on the unit thi be usually only on large permanently instal motor the installation instruction will tell you if you need one subject what size wire should i use for a amp circuit use gauge wire for a amp circuit you can use gauge wire in most locale for a long run though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid voltage drop gauge be only slightly more expensive than gauge though it stiffer and harder to work with here a quick table for normal situation go up a size for more than foot run when the cable be in conduit or gang with other wire in a place where they ca dissipate heat easily gauge amp we do list bigger size because it start get very dependent on the application and precise wire type subject where do these number come from there be two consideration voltage drop and heat buildup the smaller the wire be the higher the resistance be when the resistance be higher the wire heat up more and there be more voltage drop in the wire the former be why you need higher-temperature insulation bigger wire for use in conduit the latter be why you should use larger wire for long run neither effect be very significant over very short distance there be some very specific exception where use of smaller wire be allow the obviou one be the line cord on most lamp do try thi unles you certain that ymy use fit one of those exception you can never go wrong by use larger wire subject what do mean thi be use to describe the size and quantity of conductor in a cable the first number specify the gauge the second the number of current carry conductor in the wire but remember there usually an extra grind wire mean gauge two insulate current carry wire plu bare grind wire usually ha a black white and bare grind wire sometime the white be red instead for circuit without neutral in the latter case the sheath be usually red too wire usually ha a black red white and bare grind wire usually carry with neutral subject what be a wirenut marrette marr connector how be they use a wire nut be a cone shape thread plastic thingummy that use to connect wire together marrette or marr connector be trade name you usually use a lot of them in diy wire in essence you strip the end of the wire about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on though some wirenut advertise that you do need to twist the wire do it anyway it more mechanically and electrically secure there be many different size of wire nut you should check that the wire nut you use be the correct size for the quantity and size of wire you connect together do just gimble the wire together with a pair of plier or ymy finger use a pair of blunt nose linesman plier and carefully twist the wire tightly and neatly sometime it a good idea to trim the result end to make sure it go in the wirenut properly some person wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical tape thi be probably not a good idea the inspector may tear it off during an inspection it usually do because a bite of bare wire be expose outside the wire nut instead of tap it the connection should be redo subject what be a a gfcus be a ground-fault circuit interrupter it measure the current current flow through the hot wire and the neutral wire if they differ by more than a few milliamp the presumption be that current be leak to grind vium some other path thi may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the grind lead or through a person any of these situation be hazardou so the gfcus trip break the circuit gfci do not protect against all kind of electric shock if for example you simultaneously touch the hot and neutral lead of a circuit and no part of you wa ground a gfcus would help all of the current that pass from the hot lead into you would return vium the neutral lead keep the gfcus happy the two pair of connection on a gfcus outlet be not symmetric one be label load the other line the incoming power fee must be connect to the line side or the outlet will not be protect the load side can be use to protect all device downstream from it thu a whole string of outlet can be cover by a single gfcus outlet subject where should gfci be use the nec mandate gfci for or single phase outlet in bathroom kitchen within of the sink garage unfinished basement or crawl space outdoor near a pool or just about anywhere else where you likely to encounter water or dampnes there be exception for inaccessible outlet those dedicate to appliance occupy fix space typically refrigerator and freezer and for sump pump and laundry appliance the cec do not mandate a many gfci in particular there be no requirement to protect kitchen outlet or most garage or basement outlet basement outlet must be protect if you have a dirt floor garage outlet if they near the door to outside bathroom and most exterior outlet must have gfci even if you be not require to have gfcus protection you may want to consider instal it anyway unles you need a gfcus breaker see below the cost be low in the gfcus outlet can cost a little a u cost be a bite higher in canada c evaluate ymy own risk factor do ymy finish basement ever get wet do you have small child do you use ymy garage outlet to power outdoor tool do water or melt snow ever puddle inside ymy garage subject where should i use a gfcus gfci be generally not use on circuit that a do pose a safety risk and b be use to power equipment that must run unattended for long period of time refrigerator freezer and sump pump be good example the rationale be that gfci be sometime prone to nuisance trip some person claim that the inductive delay in motor wind can cause a momentary current imbalance trip the gfcus note though that most gfcus trip be real if you get a lot of trip for no apparent reason you be well-advised to check ymy wire before decide that the gfcus be break or useles subject what be the difference between a gfcus outlet and a gfcus breaker for most situation you can use either a gfcus outlet a the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a built-in gfcus the former be generally prefer since gfcus breaker be quite expensive for example an ordinary ge breaker cost u the gfcus model cost u there be one major exception if you need to protect a multi-wire branch circuit two or more circuit share a common neutral wire such a a canadian-style kitchen circuit you need a multi-pole gfcus breaker unfortunately these be expensive the cost can range into the hundred of dollar depend on what brand of panel box you have but if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice one more caveat gfcus outlet be bulky you may want to use an oversize box when instal them on second think use large actually deep box everywhere you thank yourself for it incidentally if you instal a gfcus to ensure that one specific outlet be protect such a a bathroom you do really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not gfcus anything upstream of it but protect the whole circuit be prefer when you install a gfcus it a good idea to use the little grind fault protect sticker that come with it and mark the outlet downstream of the gfcus you can figure out which outlet be downstream simply by trip the gfcus with the test button and see which outlet be dead subject what the purpose of the grind prong on an outlet then apart from their use in electronic which we wo comment on and for certain fluorescent light they wo turn on without a good grind connection they intend to guard against insulation failure within the device generally the case of the appliance be connect to the grind lead if there an insulation failure that short the hot lead to the case the grind lead conduct the electricity away safely and possibly trip the circuit breaker in the proces if the case be not ground and such a short occur the case be live and if you touch it while you ground you get zap of course if the circuit be gfci-protected it will be a very tiny zap which be why you can use gfci to replace ungrounded outlet both nec and cec there be some appliance that should never be ground in particular that apply to toaster and anything else with expose conductor consider if you touch the heat electrode in a toaster and you not ground nothing will happen if you slightly ground you get a small shock the resistance will be too high but if the case be ground and you be hold it you be the perfect path to grind subject why be one prong wider than the other polarization nowaday many two-prong device have one prong wider than the other thi be so that the device could rely not guarantee on one specific wire be neutral and the other hot thi be particularly advantageou in light fixture where the the shell should neutral safety or other device which want to have an approximate grind reference ie some radio most extension cord have wide prong too thi require that you wire ymy outlet and plug the right way around you want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one hot most outlet have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter colour screw for the neutral if not you can usually figure out which be which by which prong the terminate screw connect to subject what kind of outlet do i need in a kitchen the nec require at least two amp small appliance circuit for kitchen the cec require split-duplex receptacle outlet must be instal such that no point be more than nec mm cec from an outlet every counter wider than nec or mm cec must have at least one outlet the circuit these outlet be on may not fee any outlet except in the kitchen pantry or din room furthermore these circuit be in addition to any require for refrigerator stave microwave light etc non-dedicated outlet within of a sink must be protect by a gfcus nec only split duplex receptacle be feed with a circuit the tab be break on the hot side of the outlet and one hot go to the upper outlet and the other hot go to the lower outlet the neutral connect to both outlet through one screw when carry through to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that remove the outlet or have the neutral connection fall off do cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlet subject where must outlet and switch be in bathroom there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporate in the light fixture all such outlet must be gfci-protected subject what be what be bx when should i use each romex be a brand name for a type of plastic insulate wire sometime call non-metallic sheath the formal name be nm thi be suitable for use in dry protect area ie inside stud wall on the side of joist etc that be not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat most newer home be wire almost exclusively with nm wire there be several different category of nm cable bx cable technically know a armor cable or ac ha a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductor and be fairly resistant to damage teck cable be ac with an additional external thermoplastic sheath protection for cable in conceal location where nm or ac cable be run through stud joist or similar wooden member the outer surface of the cable must be keep at least cec nec from the edge of the wooden member or the cable should be protect from mechanical injury thi latter protection can take the form of metal plate such a spare outlet box end or conduit note inspector-permitted practise in canada suggest that armor cable or flexible conduit can be use a the mechanical protection but thi be technically illegal additional protection recommendation these be rule in the canadian code they be reasonable answer to the vague reference to expose to mechanical damage in both the nec and cec nm cable should be protect against mechanical damage where it pas through floor or on the surface of wall in expose location under foot from the floor ie use ac instead flexible conduit wooden guard etc where cable be suspend a in connection to furnace or water heater the wire should be protect canadian practise be usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall and use a short length of ac cable or nm cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance stapling nm to a piece of lumber be also sometime use where nm cable be run in close proximity to heat duct or pipe heat transfer should be minimize by mean of a air space or suitable insulation material a wad of fiberglas nm cable shall be support within of every box or fit and at interval of no more than hole in joist or stud be consider support some slack in the cable should be provide adjacent to each box while fish cable be technically in violation it be permit where proper support be impractical conductor nm cable should never be staple on edge knight also insist on only one cable per staple refer to the workmanship clause but thi seem more honour in the breach cable should never be bury in plaster cement or similar finish cable should be protect where it run behind baseboard cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joist or the lower edge of rafter where the headroom be more than whenever bx cable be terminate at a box with a clamp small plastic bush must be insert in the end of the cable to prevent the clamp force the sharp end of the armor through the insulation bx be sometime a good idea in a work shop unles cover by solid wall cover in place where damage be more likely like on the back wall of a garage you may be require to use conduit a ul or csa approve metal pipe you use variou type of fit to join the pipe or provide for the wire service entrance frequently use a plastic conduit in damp place eg bury wire to outdoor light you will need special wire eg cec nec uf look like very heavy-duty you will usually need short length of conduit where the wire the grind see underground wire section thermoplastic sheath wire such a nm nmw etc should not be expose to direct sunlight unles explicitly approve for that purpose many electrical code do not permit the rout of wire through furnace duct include cold air return plenum construct by metal sheet enclose joist space the reason for thi be that if there a fire the ducting will spread toxic gas from burn insulation very rapidly through the build teflon insulate wire be permit in plenum in many area canada appear to use similar wire designation to the u except that canadian wire designation usually include the temperature rat in celsiu eg versu ac in the u nm-b be degree celciu note local code vary thi be one of the item that change most often eg chicago code require conduit everywhere there be very different requirement for mobile home check ymy local code especially if you do anything that the slightest out of the ordinary wire selection table incomplete the real table be enormou uncommon wire type or application omit condition type cec nec dry plastic nm armor ac damp plastic nmc armor wet plastic armor exposed to weather plastic nmwu tw etc armor direct earth burial plastic nmwu uf service entrance rwu twu armor nmwu not for service entrance subject should i use plastic or metal box the nec permit use of plastic box with non-metallic cable only the reason be simple with armor cable the box itself provide grind conductor continuity plastic box do use metal cable clamp the cec be slightly different the cec never permit cable armor a a ground conductor however you must still provide grind continuity for metallic sheath the cec also require ground of any metal cable clamp on plastic box the advantage of plastic box be comparatively minor even for non-metallic sheathe cable you can avoid make one grind connection and they sometime cost a little le on the other hand plastic box be more vulnerable to impact for expose or shop wire metal box be probably better subject junction box position a junction box be a box use only for connect wire together junction box must be locate in such a way that they accessible later ie not bury under plaster excessive use of junction box be often a sign of sloppy installation and inspector may get nasty subject can i install a replacement light fixture in general one can replace fixture freely subject to a few caveat first of course one should check the amperage rat of the circuit if ymy heart be set on instal half a dozen watt floodlight you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box but there be some more subtle constraint a well for example older house wire do have high-temperature insulation the exces heat generate by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obviou bad result some newer fixture be specifically mark for high temperature wire only you may find in fact that ymy ceiling wire already ha thi problem in which case replace any device be a real adventure other concern include provide a suitable grind for some fluorescent fixture and make sure that the ceiling box and it mount be strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan you may need to install a new box specifically list for thi purpose a acros the ceiling joist make a good support metal bracket be also available that can be fish into ceiling thru the junction box hole and mount between the joist there be special rule for recess light fixture such a pot lamp or heat lamp when these be instal in insulate ceiling they can present a very substantial fire hazard the cec provide for the installation of pot lamp in insulate ceiling provide that the fixture be box in a coffin usually make by make a pair of joist high and cover with plywood that do have any insulation ye that foot long nec rule be somewhat le stringent they require at least clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation the rule also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which mean that a cec-style coffin might be worthwhile presumably that up to the local inspector the cec do actually mandate the coffin per-se thi seem to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture ca get accidentally bury in insulation ie if you have insulation blow in later there be now fixture that contain integral thermal cutout and fairly large case that can be bury directly in insulation they be usually limit to watt bulb and be unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the older type before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such use follow the installation instruction carefully the prescribe location for the sensor can vary there do not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that be approve for use in insulation the coffin appear the only legal approach subject what do it mean when the light brighten when a motor start thi usually mean that the neutral wire in the panel be loose depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up be more than and the other le than with respect to grind thi be a very hazardou situation it can destroy ymy electronic equipment possibly start fire and in some situation electrocute you ie some u jurisdiction require the stave frame connect to neutral if thi happen contact ymy electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem note a brief second brighten be sometime normal with light and motor on the same with neutral circuit a loose main panel neutral will usually show increase brightnes far longer than one second in case of doubt get help subject what be phase power should i use it can i get it in my house three phase power ha three hot wire degree out of phase with each other these be usually use for large motor because it be more efficient provide a bite more start torque and because the motor be simpler and hence cheaper you most likely to encounter a phase circuit that show volt between any hot and grind and volt between any two hot the latter show the difference between a normal common neutral circuit which be volt between the two hot there be phase circuit with different voltage bringing in a phase fee to ymy house be usually ridiculously expensive or impossible if the equipment you want to run ha a standard motor mount it be much cheaper to buy a new or motor for it in some case it be possible to run phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor a a auto generator these be tricky but be a good solution if the motor be non-standard size or too expensive or too big to replace the taunton pres book the small shop ha an article on how to do thi if you must note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by use such a converter the law of thermodynamic guarantee that subject is it better to run motor at or theoretically it do make any difference however there be a difference be the amount of power lose in the supply wire all thing be equal a motor will lose time le power in the house wire than a motor thi also mean that the startup surge los will be le and the motor will get to speed quicker and in some circumstance the smaller power los will lead to longer motor life thi be usually irrelevant unles the supply wire be more than foot long subject what be thi nonsense about on circuit it be a universal physical law that hp be equal to watt given heat los power factor and other inefficiency it be usually best to consider hp be go to need watt a circuit can only deliver watt to a motor so it can not possibly be more than approximately hp given rational efficiency factor be more like it some equipment manufacturer sear in particular most router manufacturer in general advertise a hp rat that be far in exces of what be possible they be give you a stall horsepower or similar that mean the power be measure when the motor be just about to stop turn because of the load what they do mention be that if you keep it in that condition for more than a few second hopefully ymy breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt it draw far more current than it can continuously when compare motor compare the continuou horsepower thi should be on the motor nameplate if you ca find that figure check the amperage rat which be alway present subject how do i convert two prong receptacle to three prong older home frequently have two-prong receptacle instead of the more modern three these receptacle have no safety grind and the cable usually ha no grind wire neither the nec or cec permit instal new prong receptacle anymore there be several different approach to solve thi if the wire be do through conduit or bx and the conduit be continuou back to the panel you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle box nec mainly cec frown on thi practise if there be a copper cold water pipe go nearby and it continuou to the main house grind point you can run a conductor to it from the third prong run a grind conductor back to the main panel easiest install a gfcus receptacle the grind lug should not be connect to anything but the gfcus protection itself will serve instead the gfcus will also protect downstream possibly also two prong outlet if you do thi to protect downstream outlet the grind must not be connect together since it would be connect to a real grind a wire fault could energize the case of prong device connect to other outlet be sure though that there be indirect grind plug connection such a vium the sheath on bx cable the cec permit you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the u grind with a non-conducting goop like caulk compound thi be not permit in the nec subject are you sure about gfci and ungrounded outlet should the test button work we sure about what the nec and cec say remember though that ymy local code may vary a for the test button there a resistor connect the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you pres the test button current through thi resistor show up a an imbalance and trip the gfcus thi be a simple passive and reliable test and do require a real grind to work if ymy gfcus do not trip when you pres the test button it be very probably defective or miswired again if the test button do work something break and potentially dangerou the problem should be correct immediately the instruction that come with some gfci specify that the grind wire must be connect we do not know why they say thi the cause may be a mundane a an old instruction sheet or with the formality of ul or csa list perhap the device wa never test without the grind wire be connect on the other hand ul or csa approval should only have be grant if the device behave properly in all list application include ungrounded outlet replacement one of u call leviton their gfci be label for installation on ground circuit only the technician wa surprise to see that he agree that the nec do not require it and promise to investigate subject how should i wire my shop a with any other kind of wire you need enough power for all device that will be on simultaneously the code specify that you should stay under of the nominal capacity of the circuit for typical home shop use thi mean one circuit for the major power tool and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac use at least gauge wire many power tool have big motor with a big start-up surge if you can use amp breaker nec though cec require standard receptacle which mean you have to replug all ymy equipment light should either be on a circuit of their own and not share with circuit in the rest of the house or be on at least two separate circuit the idea be that you want to avoid a situation where a blade be still spin at several thousand rpm while you grope in the dark for the off switch do install lot of outlet it easier to install them in the begin when you do have to cut into an exist cable it useful if at least two circuit be accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time a the tool you really want but use metal box and plate and maybe even metal-sheathed cable you may have object fly around at high speed if something go a bite wrong note that some jurisdiction have a no horizontal wire rule in workshop or other unfinished area that be use for work what thi mean be that all wire must be run along structural member ie staple to stud other possible shop circuit include heater circuit circuit for some large tool and air compressor circuit do overload circuit and do use extension cord if you can help it unles they rat for high current a coil extension cord be not a safe a a straight length of wire of the same gauge also the insulation wo withstand a much heat and heat dissipation be the critical issue if ymy shop be locate at some remove from ymy main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive ymy shop wire from it if you have young child you may want to equip thi panel with a cut-off switch and possibly a lock if you want to install individual switch to safe particular circuit make sure you get one rat high enough for example ordinary light switch be not safely able to handle the start-up surge generate by a table saw buy horsepower-rated switch instead finally note that most home shop be in garage or unfinished basement hence the nec requirement for gfci apply and even if you know that you never use one of ymy shop outlet to run a lawn mower the next owner of ymy house might have a different idea note fine woodworking magazine often carry article on shop wire april be one place to start subject underground wiring you will need to prepare a trench to specification use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tube and possibly lumber do use creosote lumber it rot thermoplastic insulation and act a a catalyst in the corrosion of lead the transition from in-house to underground wire be generally vium conduit all outdoor box must be specifically list for the purpose and contain the appropriate gasket fit etc if the location of the box be subject to immersion in water a more seriou style of water-proof box be need and of course do forget the gfci the require depth and other detail vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult ymy inspector about ymy specific situation a hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that say bury power line and bury it a few inch above where the wire ha be place subject aluminum wire during the aluminum instead of copper wire become quite popular and wa extensively use since that time aluminum wire ha be implicate in a number of house fire and most jurisdiction no longer permit it in new installation we recommend even if you allow to that do not use it for new wire but do panic if ymy house ha aluminum wire aluminum wire when properly instal can be just a safe a copper aluminum wire be however very unforgiving of improper installation we will cover a bite of the theory behind potential problem and what you can do to make ymy wire safe the main problem with aluminum wire be a phenomenon know a cold creep when aluminum wire warm up it expand when it cool down it contract unlike copper when aluminum go through a number of cycle it losis a bite of tightnes each time to make the problem worse aluminum oxidise or corrode when in contact with certain type of metal so the resistance of the connection go up which cause it to heat up and corrode oxidize still more eventually the wire may start get very hot melt the insulation or fixture it attach to and possibly even cause a fire since person usually encounter aluminum wire when they move into a house build during the we will cover basic point of safe aluminum wire we suggest that if you consider purchase a home with aluminum wire or have discover it later that you hire a license electrician or inspector to check over the wire for the follow thing fixture eg outlet and switch directly attach to aluminum wire should be rat for it the device will be stamp with or the latter supersede the former but both be safe these fixture be somewhat more expensive than the ordinary one wire should be properly connect at least way around the screw in a clockwise direction connection should be tight while repeat tighten of the screw can make the problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection note that aluminum wire be still often use for the main service entrance cable it should be inspect push-in terminal be an extreme hazard with aluminum wire any connection use push-in terminal should be redo with the proper screw connection immediately there should be no sign of overheat darken connection melt insulation or bake fixture any such damage should be repair connection between aluminum and copper wire need to be handle specially current canadian code require that the wire nut use must be specially mark for connect aluminum to copper the nec require that the wire be connect together use special crimp device with an anti-oxidant grease the tool and material for the latter be quite expensive not practical to do it yourself unles you can rent the tool any non-rated receptacle can be connect to aluminum wire by mean of a short copper pigtail see above show reasonable workmanship neat wire properly strip not nick wire etc if when consider purchase a home an inspection of the wire show no problem or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wire safe if there be sign of problem in many place we suggest you look elsewhere if the wrong receptacle be use you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtail have thi professionally do can range from to per you can do thi yourself too subject i buy a house what should i do congratulation but it generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hide gotcha not just for wire but plumb and structural a well if an inspection of the wire show no problem or only one or two minor one we believe that you can consider the wire safe after any minor problem be fix if there be sign of problem in many place we suggest you look elsewhere here some hint on what to look for obviou non-code wire can include zip cord wire either conceal or nail to wall hot wire on the identify neutral conductor without proper mark ungrounded ground outlet except when downstream of a gfcus splice hang in mid-air other than proper knob-and-tube switched neutral unsecured romex swing about like grapevine certain wire practise that be actually to code or be at one time sometime reveal diy wire that may have hide violation switch that seem to control nothing abandon perhap not properly terminate wire a wall switch that shut off a group of light that be separately control by other wall switch except when it really convenient switch and outlet in bizarre location great number of junction box without outlet or lamp junction box with great number of wire go into them wiring that pas through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling backwrapped ground wire subject what be thi weird stuff old style wire in the year since edison invent electricity several different wire style have come and go when you buy an older home you may encounter some of thi stuff thi section describe the old method and some of their idiosyncrasy the oldest wire system you likely to encounter be call knob and tube k t it be make up of individual conductor with a cloth insulation the wire be run along side structural member eg joist or stud use ceramic stand-off knob wire be run through structural member use ceramic tube connection be make by twist the wire together solder and wrap with tape since the hot and neutral be run separately the wire tend to be rather confuse a neutral often run down the centre of each room with tap off to each fixture the hot wire tend to run from one fixture to the next in some case k t be colour-coded so the neutral be often the same colmy a the hot wire you see k t in home build a late a the comment on k t the person instal k t be pretty paranoid about electricity so the workmanship tend to be pretty good the wire insulation and insulator tend to stand up very well most k t i see for example be in quite good condition no ground grounding be usually difficult to install box be small receptacle replacement particularly with gfcus can be difficult no bush on box either so wire change need special attention to box entry sometime the neutral be balance very well between separately hot circuit so it be sometime possible to overload the neutral without exceed the fuse on any circuit building code do not permit insulation in wall that contain k t connection to exist k t from new circuit can be tricky consult ymy inspector modern wire practise require considerably more outlet to be instal than k t system do since k t tend to be in pretty decent condition it generally be necessary to replace it simply because it k t what you should watch out for be renovation that have interfere with it and be cautiou about circuit load in many case it perfectly reasonable to leave exist k t alone and add new fixture on new circuit use modern technique after k t they invent multi-conductor cable the first type you will see be roughly a cloth and varnish insulation it look much like the romex cable of the last decade or two thi stuff wa use in the and again no ground conductor it wa instal much like modern wire it major drawback be that thi type of insulation embrittle we see whole system where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch bx cable of the same vintage ha similar problem thi stuff be very fragile and become rather hazardou if the wire become bare thi wire should be leave untouched a much a possible whenever an opportunity arise replace it a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hmy long frustrate fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink tube after thi wire technique the more modern romex wa invent it almost a asphalt impregnate cloth often a bite sticky thi stuff stand up reasonably well and do present a hazard and be reasonably easy to work with it do not need to be replace it should be consider a safe a the modern stuff thermoplastic insulation wire just do abuse it too much subject where do i buy stuff try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you their price will often be considerably better than chain
