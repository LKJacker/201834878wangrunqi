from glenne glenn elmore subject re single chip receiver for fsk john ackermann x jra write my next project be to come up with an module for fast to packet radio use no fancy modulation scheme just wide fsk for use at or mhz i a bite familiar with the motorola chip but i wonder if there be newer design that might work at higher input frequency my goal be to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back end with if input on one end and an fsk demondulator on the other i particularly interest in way to use a higher if than do any current chip work up to say with internal downconversion so a normal if filter can be use any suggestion john what you describe be very close to what i build and describe in the arrl computer network conference proceed i build watt fsk transceiver at mhz they be essentially double conversion transverter with digital mod and demod at mhz the receiver use the which be the same fsk receiver chip i use previouslyu in the mbp ghz datum link i first publish in ham radio and which be now also in the arrl handbook the which include a vhf converter section could also be use at these speed there be a newer and perhap slightly improve design of thi the if i remember rightly while use thi would have let me reduce the external if count on receive it do really offer all that much help on transmit so i do bother with it the radio i build be first design and build for kbp in a mhz channel but later reduce to half that these kbp radio actually have do quite well in across-the-bench test at kbp and speed be pretty much a function of filter design handling the datum stream be another matter entirely some of the exist radio be currently deploy on hilltop in a beacon test mode while there be not yet end-end two-way datum flow due to lack of resource to debug software for the digital hardware mio also show in the cnc proceed datum be perfect copy at even though the datum clock be currently at about half speed the a kbyte of the test text chapter of isaiah take only a little over of a second i be hop that someone would get interest enough to step in and get involve in write code to make the whole thing usable borland ide environment with remote debug possible a mention in the proceed but to date a couple of u have be on my own and run low on resource of time money and energy if anyone in the sf bay area want to check it out there be also a cw id after the text on the mark side at mhz from beacon on sonoma mtn and black mtn overlook si valley the antenna be horizontally polarize i gues in retrospect my suggestion be that thi be a fairly costly approach if the radio be intend for user rather than backbone and you might want to carefully consider ymy target if you ca arrange ymy path such that you have complete line-of-sight i think you want to addres the inter-symbol-interference cause by multipath and probably link budget if path be very far from lo for more detail see the cnc i currently work on a spread spectrum direct conversion design to addres some of these problem i be glad to help a i can with any design problem glenn elmore amateur ip glenn internet glenne
