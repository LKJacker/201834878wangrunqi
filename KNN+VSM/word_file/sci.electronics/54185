from gsulliva glenn a sullivan subject re how do you build neural network mmos matthew d mos write in other word be there some sort of neural network circuit i could build after a visit to a local r-shack marvin minsky hi there write of build perceptron in the use motor-driven potentiometer to vary the weight he report that the circuit work even tho there be wire error can you say robust cadium sulfide cell vary with light cmo or ttl gate provide the sigmoid somewhat-linear-yet-somewhat-limiter transfer function often use low power schottky gate and earlier gate ha about a gain of led probably output enough light to easily control cd cell even at a few ma and paper with dark and light region control by pencil and eraser could also control cd resistance the very high input resistance of cmo gate may let you charge up cap to serve a memory allen sullivan
