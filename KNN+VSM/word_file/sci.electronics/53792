from john d zitterkopf subject info amp ic amp sec possible pspice model hi being a electronic engineering student with only electronic ius under my belt i find myself need to build a moderate wattage audio amp so i throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the please explain how watt be calculate in audio amp circuit no not just how it relate to one of the follow ai current gain av voltage gain ap power gain or whatever i already have a wonderful cheap schematic for a amp but i would like to the circuit the problem be that the part list ha and a amplifier they look like pin sip package with a heatsink thi schematic wa publish in a mag so it may be non-existant now anyway i try look up a replacement in the latest digi-key cat and find it not list the close i could figure wa a pin sip a anyone get any idea i think hey i can rin a pspice simulation use opamp model yea great it work but i gues the wa make for high power amp a a result i get a voltage gain of worse than i start with do anyone have a pspice ckt file with cheap yet good gain how about some model for some of the chip list in thi e-mail any ascius chip info you guy can send me i open to please e-mail since i have little time to search the news and i post if there and interest john ibm ee major do it best atarus john d zitterkopf rule aol zitt
