from mpaul marxhausen paul subject re passive mixer shaffer-wendy wendy shaffer write i try to build a mixer for a friend of mine to run several thing into a single boom box i have a circuit that use an op-amp power by either a couple of battery or use some kind of power supply but in a catalog i wa look at recently a passive mixer for guitar wa advertise taht do appear to use any power at all do anyone know what the circuit for thi would be because then i could just adapt it for rca jack and save my friend and i alot of mess with battery and plug thank well the fastest crudest mixer aside from just physically connect all ymy input together directly be to run each signal through a resistor to a common output the resistor give some isolation so the signal source be drive directly into each other taking a wild seat-of-the-pants gues i say that if you be mix high-impedance source like some dynamic mike electric guitar pickup etc ymy resistor ought to be maybe or so if you be mix line-level stuff or the output of a walkman or such i go with input output input input paul marxhausen university of nebraska lincoln grace happen
