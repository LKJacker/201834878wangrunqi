from mpaul marxhausen paul subject how to kill ac inductive load spike is there a fast dirty way to kill the line spike that occur when an inductive load be turn on sometime other than at zero-crossing of the ac cycle a capacitor kludged in somehow etc i get a microcontroller that be run a bunch of valf and pump in a big instrument washer and almost everything be be switch with zero-crossing solid state relay so that stuff stay quiet ac-wise but there one steam valve that get turn on by a mechanical relay in the water tank system and it not under control of my ssr and it do sometime a spike that reset one of my peripheral chip my software time out and try again but i love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid have to do some major a varistor would help but might not be sufficient idea paul marxhausen university of nebraska lincoln grace happen
