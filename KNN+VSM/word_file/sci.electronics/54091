from dino tony stewart subject re need help with video detection circuit verity steve verity write i be try to build a circuit that detect the presence of video v a blank screen by monitor the r g and b output of a graphic card it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at mhz which would mean detect a n pulse it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen about mv and a dim screen say around mv oh ye it also need to be cheap my first circuit wa a dismal failure i use compariator each compariator have the input go to one of the gun the input go to a reference create by a voltage divider a potentiometer the first problem wa that the compariator wa way too slow i need to get several pixel in a row before it would fire the compariator so i could have a whole screen full of text but my the second problem be that there wa more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen in fact the difference between completely black and completely white be only mv i be wonder if i be go to have to amplify the video signal to make thi work there be faster compariator but they be expensive and require split supply i would need to replace my quad compariator with three compariator and create a whole new power supply circuit at thi point i think what i need be some sort of transistor circuit transistor be fast and cheap and should do the trick unfortunately i be way out of my league when it come to design transistor circuit so i be appeal to the net for help any idea tip circuit pointer reference etc would be greatly appreciate oh ye i only sample the output of thi thing every second or so so i do need a fast response time at all however i have find a way to take advantage of that fact thank a lot for any help anybody might be able to give of course you will have my undying gratitude steve verity steve verity maxed on midi verity in order to get the n response time you need you be better off go to an ecl slicer which can run off a single or v supply you just need to bia or do some level shift perhap to get it in the range check out the ecl book for a simple cheap solution dino the inquiring mind bb winnipeg manitoba
