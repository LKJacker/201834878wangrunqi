from squish shishin yamada subject re atarus processor in article ifarqhar ian farquhar write in article squish shishin yamada write the atarus use a cpu just like their entire line computer a well a the game machine wrong it ha a sorry ian i have toy with it in several year i have see the inside in quite a few year i just saw the post lag for quite a few day and think i tos in my i assume the wa functionally similar to the wa it also make by mo technology i really be more verse in the base atarus computer the come later on the have some extra asic chip that be basically modify graphic chip and pium for the joystick it have one custome chip not an asic in the sense that word be now understand the tium sometime know a the although most other manufacturer list that a the cium complex interface adapter tium stand for television interface adapter and it handle sound paddle and the minimal video hardware the possess in the atarus computer the cium chip you refer to sound an awful lot like the ctium color television interface adapter chip use in the early model later atarus upgrade thi to the gtium graphic other colorful literature state that the gtium might have stand for george the developer of the chip there wa also a standard ram timer riot plu a voltage regulator and if memory serve a timer that all later model might have incorporate many of the chip into one ascus a the weight of the machine and part count decrease a lot over the year not accord to the service documentation i have here the do not change intenally very much at all funny i have an old and new model the old one wa significantly heavier additionally i think the use and up to of rom for their game rom be map into the upper of the addres space and game be fine but later and game need bank switch atarus and other make much of these huge cartridge i have no idea how much ram it have to work with but i would hazard a gues of or ram sorry i be way out of line here my first microcontroller i build wa a base chipset with byte onboard that wa not easy to work with in addtion to a small on-board eprom wrong it have byte of ram from the riot thi wa multiply map into both page pseudo-register and page stack and also throughout the bottom of memory tium register also sit in thi addres space a byte of ram wa somewhat limit some later cartridge also carry ram themself which wa interest a atarus have provide no write line to the cart thi wa manage by map the read from ram into one addres range and the write into another but all the time thi scheme eat into the very scarce rom addres space ian
