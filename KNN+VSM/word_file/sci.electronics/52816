from ritley subject seeking thermocouple amplifier circuit i would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which be output from a thermocouple preferably by a factor of or so that the result voltage can be feed more easily into a personal-computer-based adc datum acquisition card might anyone be able to point me to reference to such circuit i have see simple amplifier circuit before but i be not sure how well they work in practice in thi case i like something which will amplify sufficiently nicely to be use for thermocouple say a few degree accuracy or better any pointer would be greatly appreciate
