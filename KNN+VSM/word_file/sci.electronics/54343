from peter j demko subject re pc parallel i from article by baden baden de barus erickson alan erickson write i try to bring in bite to a pc and would like to use interrupt-driven routine without buy an io board or make a new port where can i bring in these bite lpt seem to have only a few input but i hear rumour that some lpt have bidirectional line anybody know fer sure if any bi-d lpt which board have them i be run a new ye it be possible i make a stepper controller board with digital input and up to digital output from the port one main thing that will tell you whether the port be bi-directional or not be the bu tranceiver on it look for a chip number if you do have thi then it probably a which will do you no good for read in now if you do have the then do the follow first find the addres of the port decimal either or in pascal you would write port xxx where xxx be the addres in either hex or decimal the statu line pin a well a the strobe pin be bi-directional line and be read by base addres so for to read from statu then read from you can also output to these line in the same fashion a to the datum line in pascal do port xxx value hope thi help let me know if you need more help inspiration come to o baden those who baden seek the baden de barus unknown a it happen you helped me quite a bit i considering building a very similar device just for something to do thi summer the idea is to code the output bit into multiple current-amplified output channel software will handle the way the amplified output are manipulated so that thi magic box can handle more application than just stepper motor also looking for a robot arm cheap to attach thi box to so i can wow and impres my friend any hint peter j demko
