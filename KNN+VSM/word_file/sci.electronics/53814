from wout wout serdijn subject re how can uf be different from two in series in mg michael golan write i wa look at the amp diagram for sony receiver and i wa amaze to find a difference between the u and canadian model on the capacitor s that hang off the output to the speaker to speaker identical both model from amp idnetical both model canadian model only u model and world-wide model only candian model only gound the board itself be also identical with room for all three cap the version be clearly indicate in both place how do that make sense be essentially for cap there be just standard cap no special please explain thi michael golan mg the only explanation i can think of be that two capacitor in series can handle twice the output voltage sometime two elco in antiseries you know positive side face eachother be use to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltage a well so there probably be no design-philosophical reason but a production-cost one best wouter
