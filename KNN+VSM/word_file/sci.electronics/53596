from gerald belton subject re a question about so here my question it seem to me that i have the same electrical circuit if i hook the neutral jumper from the neutral over to the grind screw on new prong ground outlet what wrong with my reason here first go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of wiring simplified by richter now if ymy house be wire with metal conduit you do need a seperate grind wire assume the house be wire correctly and the pipe be connect to a cold water pipe in ymy basement the outlet that have a neutral hook to the grind screw seem wrong anyone else think so back in the i wa a service technician for a cash register company the cash register use microprocessor circuit and back then they be very susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise the biggest problem come from outlet that be not properly ground in almost every place we go to do an installation we find outlet with the grind connect to the neutral for of the thing you can plug into one of these they work fine for my cash register they be a nightmare line noise tend to scramble the memory periodically with modern electronic use switch power supply thi should be le of a problem even the company i use to work for be no longer recommend a dedicate line with a seperate grind for their equipment i imagine if you check most household wire you will find that the grind and neutral be connect although not ideal it should be for most application slmr my reality check just bounce the ozone hole bb a private bulletin board service full service node usrobotic bp gig file skydive new orlean rime network mail hub usenet newsgroup please route all question or inquiry to postmaster
