from kolstad joel kolstad subject re can radio freq be used to measure distance in article robert g carpenter write i wonder if it possible to use radio wave to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver ye you could seem to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance thi would be for short distance ft and i would need to have accuracy of inch or so well letsee whip out soon to be gx nanosecond resolution hmm that be rather difficult the more standard read better method be to use ultrasound generally somewhere around sound travel a heck of a lot slower than light radio wave and be therefore much easier to deal with what frequency would be best for thi or do matter it might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerou sonic estimator type device that do what you want here many be pretty cheap too in fact for awhile the stanley estimator wa sell for something like that the one i buy joel kolstad
