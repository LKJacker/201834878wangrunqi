from billn bill nelson subject re power signal surge in home dplatt dave platt write what kind of power must he be put out to cause the effect the affect equipment be about foot from the road might be a couple of hundred watt from the sound of it kicking sound out of the tv and stereo speaker by direct rf rectification require a mighty strong carrier i hear of linear so powerful that trigger them while the car wa idle would stall the engine by pull down the battery voltage it would take a lot more than that it sound like the radio equipment be actually not shut completely off but just go to a standby situation i suspect that the story be just that story the voltage can only be suck down so far instantaneously when you try to jumpstart someone car when ymy vehicle be at idle do ymy car stall no the other car just do not crank well now the engine might stall because the idle wa too low to start with when the extra current be draw the idle speed will drop a the alternator load down the engine to compensate for the increase amperage requirement is resolution of thi problem a matter for the power company the fcc or both ultimately it likely to be ymy problem to resolve i afraid the fcc be so understaffed that they do pay much attention to citizen complain about rfi or so i hear they just send you a pamphlet describe how you can apply corrective measure talking to the power company might help they might be able to install filter device at ymy service panel or recommend a type which you could have instal by a license electrician a transmitter be not go to be affect house power if surge be occur there it be due to another cause not a transmitter unfortunately there a fair chance that enough signal be be pick up by ymy house wire that a simple service-panel filter wo suffice you may need to install heavy-duty rfi filter at the power connection of ymy affect equipment it be probably not that much of a problem often toroid coil on the power lead will solve that part of the interference problem it will not solve internal equipment deficiency if the problem occur regularly you may need to stake out the street in question and watch for truck or car with big antenna drive by at the time interference occur if you can identify the vehicle which be transmit you may be able to contact it owner and complain it be probably not the transmitter that be at fault if the person be an amateur then will probably be will to help if you explain that the person be cause interference bill
