from jvanne subject re long distance ir detection in article cstrockb caleb strockbine write could make for some interest choreography light and sound could be control directly by the position of a dancer on stage or by the number of dancer on stage neat you could even build a spotlight that follow the dancer around on stage can you tell u more about what you do sound like a very cool program ti only a gleam in my eye at thi point i have yet to choose a track method the initial requirement wa to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zone acros the stage i do some experiment with pyroelectric detector and find them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition and dancer stand still alot so their ir signature go away the good thing about pryoelectric be that their signal be proportional to the size of the warm body or body part and the velocity of say body thi could be useful for detect the intensity of a dance gesture dancer also really hate to wear little box and battery strap on their body but they really need to be emit some kind of signal to be track the current toy i have be work with be a program call mandala for the amiga use with a live video digitizer thi work with a video camera train on the stage you can set threshold for a zone within the field of view and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event event can be midi object or sequence amiga sound or graphic object it be fun to play with but the documentaion be arcane and the digitizer be noisy still it very appeal the dancer do have to wear any appliance you can have ot of zone s it speak midi which can be use to control light and i do have to build any electronic it all do with light and video brightnes and contrast adjustment i have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic but i have hope
