from squish shishin yamada subject re blink led in article dmn there a seeker bear every minute write where can i buy blink led beside radio shack do anyone sell blink led with variable flash rate by voltage i gues if so what hertz pulse rate be they adjustable or set to i like blink led that can be set for approx hz hz hz or hz something like that i interest in what out there for flash rate i like the idea of led with flasher circuit already in them i hate solder ics in general gues i do have a hell of a lot of patience thank dana if you want slow led flash rate adjustable by switch or by a digitally control switch i suggest look at a oscillator chip they cost at radio shack much cheaper in quantity at quality place and you will be able to find good info about simple circuit in a oscialltor notebook i think forest mim ha one at radio shack you have to toy with value or you can use ymy head with a little math to get the right frequency any engineer worth hi salt can make a osciallator it in the book and leave up to you to see i hate do ascius circuit graphic the can accurately go from a few hz to about khz i think about the tape recorder gizmo you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel a a datum line for flash led and one a audio line for voice or music thi would eliminate a lot of noise the datum line be probably most easily do by some kind of pll or bandpas filter use just an op-amp the chip be a good pll and not hard to work with however if you nothing about how a pll work i suggest you do try thi op-amp information can also be find in the forest mim radio shack info-booklet and the popular op-amp be a snap to work with setting frequency and bandpas filter value be not so easy so i would suggest the method firstmost i have no idea what thi be go into so i be really generalize a for manufacture technique if you only goof with it i suggest you breadboard the thing no need to solder wire-wrap would be the next more permanent step and lastly make hope that clear thing squish
