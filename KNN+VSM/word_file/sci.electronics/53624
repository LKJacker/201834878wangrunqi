from tomb tom bruhn subject re a question about outlet wire crisp rus crisp write so here my question it seem to me that i have the same electrical circuit if i hook a jumper from the neutral over to the grind screw on new prong ground outlet what wrong with my reason here may i respectfully suggest you not do thi the grind be suppose to be a protective grind and though what you suggest look good on paper it dangerou to rely on the same wire for power and protection it never meet code and if you now own the property and later sell it you may end up with liability you do want and if you now own it well there a wire faq that i think address thi i believe an alternative be use of a gfcus but i really not sure what current code allow in thi area the gfcus sense alternate unwanted current path and do rely on a specific protective grind wire at least not beyond the gfcus in the protect circuit gfcus breaker be available but expensive
