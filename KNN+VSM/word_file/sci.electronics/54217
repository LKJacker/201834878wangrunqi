from billn bill nelson subject re power signal surge in home brian brian kantor write while it possible that it a ham radio transmitter that you hear it be likely every bite of signal that do go out the antenna be waste a far a a ham be concern and most ham be it be the radiate signal that would cause the problem technically competent to ensure that they do waste any signal if they can possibly avoid it to get their ham license they have to pa a government exam that test them on that point among other however you could be hear a radio transmitter for sure there be lot of other service where the operator are require to be technically competent citizen band cb for example there be nothing in the amateur radio test that require an technical competence at all it be a simple matter to memorize all the question and answer however that say most ham that i know do spend quite a bite of time gain some technical skill listen to the interference if you hear voice clearly it almost certainly is ham radio and might well be cb if you can record a do count on that bite of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operator house and ask him for hi opinion of what you hear most community you can not do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen if the interference occur at a specific time each day then it would be possible to do such schedule if nothing else you could invite the ham over to transmit from ymy driveway to see if he interfere if he do then you probably need to have ymy equipment work on to make it immune to rf interference have a ham radio interference committee whose member be most will to help you resolve interference complaint look in the phone book or ask at the local ham radio store or call the fcc for contact info the fcc may or may not have such information they have enough to do without get call for such information if nothing else call ymy city office or polouse department general busines number they should have the name of a local ham contact if it a ham he more than likely will to help get rid of the problem after all it would be hi signal he waste if it be the interference committee or the fcc may be able to suggest solution see above ymy concept of waste signal be erroneou if hi rig be transmit properly then the chance of interference with the exception of harmonic television interference be the greatest since he be put out the strongest signal it be unfortunately the case that a transmit station that be operate perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a piece of consumer audio or tv equipment just because the manufacturer of the consumer equipment cut corner on one little section of the device that would affect one person in a thousand but which bite you often that can be remedied for just a few penny by a knowledgeable person perhap even the person operate the transmitter you hear unfortunately most consumer equipment be succeptable it be all poorly design btw ham be allowed amplifier cb be illegal ham amplifier do compute it do but not for a mobile radio there be very few mobile rig that could power a watt amplifier bill
