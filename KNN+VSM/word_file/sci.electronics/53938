from duane p mantick subject re long distance ir detection sburton stan burton write i would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an ir emit source at a distance of about meter more be better in daylight the ir source could be emit a signature i lean toward khz square wave with duty cycle i be consider the use of a quadrant detector from centronic inc to give information to a head to point the sensor and thu determine the angle for the source i be consider wazing the heck out of an ir led s possibly an optek or motorola wazing would mean at least amp current pulse at thi current the duty cycle of the led drop to and i would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the require ha anyone do something like thi yeesh you will be nail those irled may i suggest get ymy mitt on the siemen irled thi unit be design to take some big current pulse if you can get ymy duty cycle down a bite it will output nearly a watt mw with real short duty cycle time nice thing about the be that it be cheap i get mine for about cent a piece even though i have to buy of them btw i have see irled with output up to watt honest watt i do have the book here at work so i ca recall the company name the watter ai cheap around but if you want some power mamamium that pretty hot they also have a watt a watt and a watt device in their line and will sell small quan to individual if you be interest i can find the book at home and get the pertinent info now a for the position detector you might try eltec in florida phone number list in the etid be they seem like nice person their specialty be passive infrared detection device so they might be able to help you out i curiou about ymy application if you do mind say the device sound like it could be useful in a lasertag game although you need to up ymy carrier signal concept to khz duane
