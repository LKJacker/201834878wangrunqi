from tomb tom bruhn subject re trace size for a amp supply acollin andy collin write how thick do i need to make a pcb trace for amp of current and do anybody have any other think on the proces what kind of pcb to use material thicknes of copper any advice graciously accept in fmy reply i see no hard number so here go for trace on the outside not inner layer expect in oz copper at amp the follow temperature rise versu width thi be from sam reference datum for engineer seventh edition pg which claim in turn to be from width temp rise inch degree c at amp the rise for the width be only about degree power go a square of the current plu the copper resistance go up a temperature go up certainly trace should be ample for what you want to do and ounce copper almost cut the require width in half i do oz at about width myself i think give that the rat current be amp and the be a transient or fault condition there another question will the voltage drop be low enough but you should be able to figure thi one out with wire table or just the resistivity of copper keep trace short and use separate sense trace where appropriate a mention by another poster
