from dp david prutchi subject re long distance ir detection in article sburton stan burton write i would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an ir emit source at a distance of about meter more be better in daylight the ir source could be emit a signature i lean toward khz square wave with duty cycle i be consider the use of a quadrant detector from centronic inc to give information to a head to point the sensor and thu determine the angle for the source i be consider wazing the heck out of an ir led s possibly an optek or motorola wazing would mean at least amp current pulse at thi current the duty cycle of the led drop to and i would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the require ha anyone do something like thi stan burton sburton dre suffield box medicine hat ab canada a method which will directly almost provide you with the information that you require be that which be commonly use for coordinate measurement of human body landmark eg the selspot system by selspot ab sweden and the watsmart system these use lateral photoeffect detector lindholm and oberg woltring and marsolai to determine the position of a spot of light project use a camera len over it surface in escence the detector be a large photodiode with fmy cathode one on each of the fmy side of the square detector crystal and a single anode the back of the crystal a spot of light will produce current which be proportional to the position of the spot on the detector face let try some ascius graphic in so the detector ha two cathode to detect linear position cathode xxxxx xxxxx light xxxxx divider output xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx gnd xxxxx xxxxx anode xxxxx cathode if the dot of light from the led be the only source of light then the position of the projection be give by thi circuit regardles of the level of illumina tion the divider be use to normalize relative to total receive power when thi circuit be use in the presence of other source of light then the way of tune to it be to sample for a few msec the background signal light the led for an equal time and sample that signal separately the difference between the two be the position of the led hamamatsu photonic sell linear and lateral photoeffect detector and they also sell the require signal process electronic the ready-made system by selspot and other be not cheap lindholm and oberg an optoelectronic instrument for remote on-line movement monitoring biotelemetry woltring and marsolai opto-electronic selspot gait measure ment in two and three dimensional space a preliminary report bull pro thetic research most probably thi technique can provide you with a much more accurate measurement than you need but i think that it simplicity beat scan a quadrant detector with a system until you reach zero difference david david prutchi washington university prutchi campu box dp one brooking drive st loui mo
