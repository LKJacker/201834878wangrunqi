from jgd john de armond subject re what do nuclear site cooling tower do nagle john nagle write great explaination however you leave off one detail why do you alway see them at nuclear plant but not alway at fossil fuel plant at nuclear plant it be prefer to run the water close cycle wherea fossil fuel plant can in some case get away with dump the hot water a i recall the water be a hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plant and of course there be le danger of radioactive contamination actually the reason you do see so many cool tower at fossil plant be fossil unit multiple unit per plant be generally smaller than nuclear plant mwe seem to be a very popular size when many fossil plant be build the average nuclear plant be mwe many fossil plant be grandfathered when water discharge regulation be adopt why those old dirt burner ca harm anything let go power draft cool tower low enough to the grind to be generally not visible from off-site be quite popular with fossil plant fossil plant use to get much le regulatory attention than nuclear actually fossil fuel plant run hotter than the usual boiling-water reactor nuclear plant there a gripe in the industry that nuclear power use vintage steam technology so it more important in nuclear plant to get the cold end of the system a cold a possible hence big cool tower oil and ga fire steam plant also have condenser but they usually be size to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient some plant do cool the condenser with water rather than air a one canadian official ask about thermal pollution de-ice a river say up here we view heat a a resource actually the condense environment be essentially the same for plant of similar size the issue be the same regardles of where the heat come from condenser be run at a high a vacuum a possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine the condenser pressure be normally water vapor pressure at the condense temperature it be desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplet because moisture in the steam cause severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blade and because entrain water move at high velocity cause erosion of the condenser tube the coldest and thu lowest pressure condense environment be alway the best a relate issue be that of pump the condensate from the hotwell where the water end up after drip off the condenser tube since the condenser be at a very low pressure the only force drive the condensate into the hotwell pump be gravity if the condensate be too hot or the gravity head be too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubble and cause the condensate pump to cavitate thi be a particularly destructive form of cavitation that be to be avoid at all cost the hotwell pump be locate in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pump how much lower they must be be a function of how hot the water be allow to get in the hotwell typically hotwell temperature run between and degree depend on the temperature of the river water thi term be use to describe the river grade water even when the cool tower system be operate in close loop mode and essentially no river water be pump when the river water temperature be high in the summer operator will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head there be a tradeoff involve since higher hotwell level will encroach onto the condense tube and reduce the condenser area at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exist in the air the river water will almost alway be cooler than the discharge water from the cool tower the temperature of the discharge water from the cool tower be set by the ambient air temperature and humidity it be very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperature exceed degree a vast difference from the typical day degree humidity we see routinely in the east it be not unusual particularly where the econazi have be successful in clamp rigid discharge water temperature limit on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the fire rate when the air temperature get too high and the condenser can not handle the heat load without excessive pressure everybody run closed-cycle boiler the water use be purify of solid which otherwise crud up the boiler plumb when the water boil purifying water for boiler use be a bigger job than cool it so the boiler water be recycle true actually secondary plant the part that make electricity and fee feedwater to the boiler water chemistry ha be the bastard stepchild until recently and ha not get the respect it deserve the plant chemist have just in the past decade or so fully understand the cost of impure water by impure i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity a few ppm of dissolve oxygen secondary water be now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory john john de armond interested in high performance
