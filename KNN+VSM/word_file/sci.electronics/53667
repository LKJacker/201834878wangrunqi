from richard d warner subject uart-cpu-rom-ram subsystem thi be a followup post to something i write previously several person respond with good information but i do think i communicate exactly what i be look for i work on a custom device that will communicate with a host vium my custom circuitry will use an or ec cpu and require about of ram preferably flash ram in look around i see that lot of person have engineer uart-cpu-rom-ram subsystem that be ready to be interfaced to ymy custom device it be do so much that it would be best if i can avoid reinvent a system it just need to use an or cpu and be able to load a program from the host then transfer control to that program well there one other thing the rom need to know how to do it should have routine to send and receive byte the host that utilize the hardware control line dtr rt dt ct everything i see be in the and up range that too much for thi application i need something around the cpu ha the uart built-in so you only look at a few chip do anyone know a company that market a good board in thi range or some public domain circuitry i can use thank in advance for the info rich
