from wtm bill mayhew subject re dumb question function generator output offset obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope and adjust the internal output offset contorl there be virtual certainty that there be an internal ajustment for the offset control zero detent position verify that the function generator be properly load many generator expect you to supply a ohm load go to a hamfest flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through ohm terminator that ha a male and female bnc or whatever connector on it the calibrator on my tektronix scope be design to put out into a meg load but volt into a ohm load you may also find that load the output of the function generator also reduce the harmonic distortion build an attenuator you do have to use and i would want to use the input impedance of the device under test a part of the voltage divider to drop the input test voltage consider thi ohm gen ohm load think about the ratio of and then think about the accuracy to which you can read voltage on ymy oscilloscope you can virtually discount the load of the also you have the millivolt test generator you want good luck bill mayhew neoucom computer service department rootstown oh usa phone wtm
