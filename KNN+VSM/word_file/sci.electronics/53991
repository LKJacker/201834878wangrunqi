from wout wout serdijn subject re pink noise tony wayne write what be pink noise and how be it use in sound experiment tony pink noise be a random signal with more low-frequency component than white noise if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer you will find that the spectrum power density be flat which mean that every frequency be present in the noise signal often pink noise be obtain from white noise by integrate of low-pas filter a white noise signal therefore pink noise contain much more low-frequency component the effect of pink noise be sometime use to simulate thunder or roar animal an additional low-pas filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why enjoy it wouter
