from johnh john haddy subject re help with ultra-long time in article mcovingt michael covington write do use big capacitor they be unreliable for time due to leakage instead use a quartz crystal and divide it frequency by time or something like that mhz divide by cycle per week approximately i would expect any component other than battery or electrolytic capacitor to fail at c or f for that matter either the battery be go to be ymy big problem also of course ymy circuit should depend on exact value of resistor which a crystal control timer wo would a crystal be affect by cold my gut feel be that a a mechanically resonate device extreme cold be likely to affect the compliance terminology of the quartz and hence it resonant frequency michael a covington internet mcovingt artificial intelligence program phone the university of georgia fax athen georgia amateur radio johnh electronic department school of mpce macquarie university sydney australium email johnh ph fax
