from dmn there a seeker bear every minute subject flash led with sound i look for a circuit that will flash an lead on in response to the output from a walkman cassette player how could i do thi i do want it just to turn on i want it to once so to speak per every beep i put on a cassette tape would it be better to use a circuit base on the volume of the beep on the cassette or better for the lead to respond to a tone of a certain frequency is there any easy way to do either of these i look for the simplest circuit possible i gues what i ask for be some sort of color organ but not quite let me trt to explain again i go to have a pattern of beat or beep on a cassette tape so on the tape you hear beep pause beep pause beep pause etc with speed increase a time go on i want to synchronize an led probably two of them with the beep on the cassette tape so the led with each beep would go on and off real quick generate a strobe light sort of effect the rapidity of the beep on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blink of the led and if there wa no sound on the tape except for background hi the led would remain off please help thank dana
