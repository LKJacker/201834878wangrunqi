from alung aaron lung subject re uninterruptible power supply in article cab chri best write i no expert at up but you say something that make it sound like you do realize something on a typical up well on our anyway there be no switchover from ac to dc all the protect equipment be alway run from the battery vium an inverter with the usual condition of also have them on charge if the power fail big deal the computer never see it until the battery start to droop but there something like car-sized battery in that cabinet so it take a while if you be gon na run the gut on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time then there be no switchover to screw thing up and no have to sense the failure fast just keep the dc on charge when the power be on and it be there in zero time when you need it actually it a bite more complicate than that i sound to me ymy up take in ac rectify it to dc to charge the battery and then take the battery dc and chop it to ac again feed ymy equipment thi approach be the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the main to battery once ymy power kick out since a you mention nothing will know about what happen down the line another way to do the up scheme be to use the main until you lose power and then kick in the battery backup with it inverter to replace the lose power the problem here be the switchover time and you get to resync the ac in no time flat unfortunately most everything be build around the assumption that ac be available so the up guy have to provide and ac output to be usable ya sortum have to make it work with what there already similar story with my telephone system it wa first invent back in the we still use the same damn system medium a they do back then if i have a phone from back then i can assure you it work on today phone system it cost too much to overhaul everyone to a new system so they make it work with what be out there
