from segros steve gros subject re how to the disk copy protect in article kschang kuo-sheng kasey chang write in article guido kleman write in article kschang kuo-sheng kasey chang write byteocide what i believe the company should do be implement the above plu a special patch once the user register that loudly exclaim upon bootup registered to xxxxx addres city state zip and disable the above two benefit encourage registration cut down on pirate and make it more traceable because if the patch registration message be encrypt it will be quite hard to change and therefore provide a stable trail of who allow their copy out of their hand and thu violate their license agreement you take two copy with a different registration id compare them byte for byte and you know where they be locate usually you will be able to find out what be what after that probably but the point be the company make the registration patch not you sure you can probably find another registerred user and compare note but why it not hinder you in any way unles you be just hack problem about person who cut too much from quote and what keep me form register a john doe from the company public domain yellow brick road tinseltown or something nothing but if you read my whole suggestion i say that you register vium mail by mail in ymy registration card then the company send you the patch which include the info you put on the registration card kasey chang i glad to see thi idea come up because i have something similar in mind what if you have an authorization key that compute from the name and addres datum when the user register you do even need to send executable code just compute key and send instruction to enter in the appropriate place the follow doe main street ca every user need a unique key the executable can propagate a much a you like the author can respond to the registration by e-mail post card whatever unauthorized user would have to put up with someone else name show up maybe on a main menu screen a well a a startup message authorized user can make a many copy a they like upgrade their machine whatever the main motivation here be guilt and irritation at see someone other than yourself a the register owner
