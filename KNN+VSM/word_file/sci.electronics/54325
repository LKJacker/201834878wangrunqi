from jmichael subject re solvent for duct-tape adhesive acetone will likely damage the carpet first solvent to try be denature alcohol do not waste ymy time with rub alcohol you can use methyl alcohol instead of denature alcohol if you want to have a cocktail while you be remove the goo use pure grain alcohol if the alcohol do not work try carbon tetrachloride if neither of these work you may need to try a stronger solvent but the alcohol work for most adhesive good luck jim
