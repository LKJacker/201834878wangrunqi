from rdell subject re lead acid battery part in article write in article vanderby david vanderbyl write lot of stuff delete the lead-acid secondary cell discharge reaction be exothermic i be glad you do not dispute thi point if you do want the lead storage battery to discharge it should be store such that it charge state be the equilibrium state during winter the grind be it cover with concrete dirt or wood maintain a cooler temperature on average than the surround air or the battery the heat capacity of air be le than that of concrete dirt or wood so it heat faster conversely air cool faster too the normal storage procedure for a battery be to leave it in an unheated garage or basement the storage surface be often cooler than the surround air with the battery temperature somewhere in-between the basement air temperature may be f the floor temperature f and the battery temperature f the air temperature be higher than the battery temperature the heat of reaction be not go to move up the gradient the floor temperature be lower than the battery temperature and heat be go to move to it the floor be an incredible heat sink might depend on where you live i know locally for most of the winter the grind and concrete floor within shed and garage unheated be signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature the air do get warmer during the day but during the night the grind and concrete be definitely warmer especially when protect by the wall from the albedo effect and the night be longer by several hour than the day rest of quote text delete jeff white richard dell
