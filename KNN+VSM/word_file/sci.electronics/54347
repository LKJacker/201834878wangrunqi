from tgk todd kelley subject re pc parallel i erickson alan erickson write i try to bring in bite to a pc and would like to use interrupt-driven routine without buy an io board or make a new port where can i bring in these bite lpt seem to have only a few input but i hear rumour that some lpt have bidirectional line anybody know fer sure if any bi-d lpt which board have them i be run a new i know for sure that the everex magic can be jumpered for a printer mode or for a general purpose bidirectional mode also i know for sure that the ibm technical reference say the follow about the monochrome display printer adapter and the ibm parallel printer adapter it be essential that the external device not try to pull these line refer to the datum line to grind and later if an external device should be drive datum on these pin in violation of usage grind rule at the time of an input thi datum will be with the latch content i will accept no responsibility if you incur damage of any kind a a result of my say i do not know for sure but i think you should be able to use a traditional parallel port a an input port by write to the datum line and then read from the datum line while an external device drife them the input datum will not be latch so noise could make thi infeasible todd
