from johnh john haddy subject re help with ultra-long time in article wellison write i have a project that wa droop in my lap that be somewhat a pain to design what i be look for be a stable ultra-long solid state timer what they want to do be to place thi thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six week every two week they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different color pellet by ga pressure out acros the snow then by dig down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measure a they come to the different color pellet the problem be try to build a timer that would stand the cold degree and a power source that would drain i have look at the timer and the standard dual timer but thier temp spec wo go that low also two week equate to second per fire which mean one big time cap i have find farad ye farad cap that have a work voltage of volt and be small in size but again the time of discharge at or lower degree be linear i wa think of use several timer chain together to fire the selonid at the end of the time period but that blast cold and the drain on a battery over six week be the pain one possibility would be to use solar panel but thi be during the six month twilight anyone have any good idea thank in advance we firstly i would never consider try to make a one-shot timer ymy cap will have be design a a ram battery substitute rather than for use in application where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current their performance in some respect be more akin to battery than to a normal cap the other point be that big electro be usually rat with tolerance so calculate exactly what capacitance you have particularly when consider the cold you should be look at design a micropower oscillator and divider chain that roll over from zero to maximum count or vice-versa once every second if you be to use something like a clock you would need a divider chain of to give an error of le than one percent in the fire time over the six week period of course you could trim the oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator remain exactly constant at be low anyway i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in fire the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit caveat i not experience in low temperature electronic so i ca guarantee that thi or any other approach be the best for inhospitable condition johnh electronic department school of mpce macquarie university sydney australium email johnh ph fax
