from alung aaron lung subject re telephone on hok ok circuit in article moffatt john thomson write just a think of mine here since an on-hook line be aprox and off-hook it usually drop below how about an led in series with a zener say around on-hook led on off-hook led off would thi work if anyone it please let me know aye there the rub if you draw enough current to light an led the equipment at the phone company will think you go off hook in the on-hook state you not suppose to draw current which mean you should just use ymy digital voltmeter you can use an old vom but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think there something wrong with the cable look guy what the problem here if you want a light that go on when the be off hook all you need it to run it in series with the line a i mention in my previou post if you want a light that go on when the be on hook all you need be a voltage threshold detector if you go to do the series diode thing which be the easiest just make sure that the led can take the current i ca recall it off-hand but it something like or more careful now folk also consider the that be force on ring and tip when the phone suppose to ring even with a simple zener and led setup you might end up with some carbon real quick whatever scheme you use make sure you get at least component on the frontend also remember that if i not mistake the phone line be a equivalent circuit any current you draw from the or so get drop acros that that fine until you down to roughly when ma bell consider it to be off-hook but drop it that far down be probably a big no-no the easiest implementation to accomplish the above tip rectifier resistor diode v zener resistor v led ring thi be only a suggestion go ahead and blow hole in it but you get the idea choose a high-efficiency led so you do need much current to get it to light up choose value for the other component a require aaron
