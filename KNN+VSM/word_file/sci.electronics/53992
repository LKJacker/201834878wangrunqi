from cmh hick subject re oversampling cd player mcmahan dave mc mahan write in a previou article kolstad joel kolstad write in article hcb h c bowman write i just buy a new portable cd player for the office and i notice that it proudly proclaim time oversampling on the box now while i think i understand what oversampling be the rate of discrete sample exceed the highest frequency component of interest by some factor i do understand thi time busines it seem to me that when i buy my first cd player wa it really year ago the spec say time could someone please tell me whether i get senile if i not then what good do it do for the player to take sample at a higher rate the datum be only ever read once bar mistrack and such of course and eventually get turn into khz bite two channel datum oversampling take two discrete datum point and interpolate point between them for n time oversampling when i ask person say that the interpolation wa not simply linear interpolation but significantly more complicate you be quite correct in ymy understand the filter be not interpolation a that would distort the frequency content of the signal they do interpolate it not linear interpolation though you be correct that the frequency content be not alter more specifically the baseband spectrum be preserve and so be every nth image spectrum the other in n image spectrum be remove where n be the oversampling rate you be listen to generally these player run the sample thru an all-pas filter network i have do thi for ecg waveform from a person ideally the filter ha a gain of from to and a gain of from to the new nyquist frequency in practice a finite transition band be require and there be also a certain amount of pass-band ripple and stop-band leakage with a high order eg tap digital filter a very good approximation can be easily achieve bit deleted about observation of interpolation filter at work in case you care the filter method use an fir finite impulse response filter i gues that cd maker use the same kind of method anybody out there know the real answer i say that they use a tap delay line with weight to accomplish the filter thi strike me a the most cost effective method for volume production run no they actually use a digital fir just like your but build in hardware on custom vlsi chip for mainly economic reason anyway then the purpose of oversampling be to move the effective sample rate up to n time khz in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filter for the same quality filter higher oversampling let you build cheaper filter wherea for the same price filter higher oversampling let you build better filter so assume the quality of all other component in a cd player remain the same oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to anti-alia filter actually i think the only reason they do thi be so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic i would gues that it be acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not you can use sloppier component and give the filter a roll-off that be so sharp it too bad that they charge more for something that i think be actually le costly to build i gues that the answer be somewhere between the two a an interest aside some of you out there may be aware of a scheme use by pioneer and wadium which be call by pioneer at least legato link i have hear one of these player but by read advertise blurb and a couple of pseudo-technical article i deduce that all they do be build a lousy digital oversampling filter and let a load of the first image ie aliassed spectrum through talking to bob stuart of boothroyd stuart aka meridian confirm my suspicion he say that it sound awful but then he would would he christopher christopher hick paradise be a linear gaussian world cmh also report to taste hot and sweaty
