from tomb tom bruhn subject re do analog system need ground plane soh kam yung write i understand the need for a grind plane in a digital system however i would like to know if such a grind plane be also necessary in an analog system note thi grind plane will not be connect except at one point to the signal grind i keep get conflict answer over thi do have a grind plane in an analog system help reduce noise also my system only deal with low frequency signal up to only well one reason for get conflict answer be that it depend on what you want the grind plane to do a continuou conductor be a good electrostatic shield do you have signal on ymy board that need shield rom other thing thi shield wo do much good for magnetic field unles you make it continuou around the circuit to be shield like a faraday cage the flip side of the coin if you be work with very high impedance you could end up with capacitance to the gound plane that cause problem you be likely to encounter thi at but at it can be a real problem one that bite me once
