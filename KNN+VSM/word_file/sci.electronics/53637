from jeh subject re need help with car stereo in article paul simundza write my friend ha a nice alpine car stereo and it only ha channel but one of them do not work it do not put out any current or voltage at all be that channel therefore blow i then shut the radio off and run continuity into the two speaker ouput of the channel and it charge and discharge so i know the wire just aint bad thi probably only tell you that the dc block capacitor that in series between the one-chip single-ended audio amp and the speaker terminal be there any idea open it up and look for the power amp ics they be fairly obviou replace the one connect to the dead output also how would i locate where the signal of the unit be before it get amplify because then could i hook up rca output to that signal so then he could just use a little amplifier well one thing you should do be poke around the terminal of the power amp chip use a probe with a resistor like a scope probe connect to the input of a small audio amp if you find line-level input to both chip one of the chip be bad and can probably replace pretty easily if you want to pick off a near-line-level signal suitable for feed to an outboard amp the outer leg of the volume control pot will often be good enough thi be before the volume control and usually before the tone and balance control too if you take off from the center and grind leg of the volume pot thi will be after the volume control but again probably before the other control if the unit be a modern type with an electronic volume control chip you should probably forget the whole thing jamie hanrahan kernel mode system san diego ca internet jeh uucp uunet cmkrnl jeh ci
