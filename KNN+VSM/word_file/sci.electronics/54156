from cpuig carlo m puig subject re analog demodulator msf michael fulbright write i be try to build a synchronou demodulator and i hit a snag in my application i want to be able to change the gain of an op amp amplifier from to controlable vium a digital input the most obviou way i come up with be to use analog switch to adjust the gain of the op amp the only analog switch i have experience with it the unfortunately i want to switch an ac signal which go from about to and the be only for positive signal i have recently use the to switch a bipolar signal i simply run the off a bipolar supply in thi case a long a ymy analog input signal stay between the supply rail the will work fine of course ymy control logic input must use a the logic low and a the logic high reference so that either all ymy drive logic must be cmo with the same bipolar supply or you must provide some kind of voltage level shift circuit between the and the control logic in my case i wa able to use the bipolar supply all the way carlo puig cpuig san jose ca
