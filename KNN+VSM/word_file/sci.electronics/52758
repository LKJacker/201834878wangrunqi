from dtmedin dave medin subject re what be zero db in article seharus babak seharus write in mark underwood write i be somewhat familiar with the db measurement a they apply to electrical circuit it be the gain of for example an amplifier measure on a logarithmic scale however thi require that you have a reference value the ouput be with respect to the input signal stuff delete what you actually talk about here be dbm and not db however the term be use loosely by most person dbm be power with respact to wherea db be a ratio now like these two english statement i be do well i be do good similarly person usually use db for dbm another common mistake be spell db instead of db a you do in ymy article see the b be for bell company the mother of at t and should be capitalize with highest regard babak seharus good gravy decibel be all ratio the question that remain in any ratio be the reference unit use sometime thi will be a reference power such a milliwatt give a certain circuit impedance which should also be include in the fine print or know like ohm in an rf circuit of that impedance lead to an accept notation of dbm maybe it might be dbv disregard the impedance of the circuit and power develop use volt a reference amplitude rather than reference power or it might have an arbitrary or omit reference that be not include in the notation lead to just plain db so look at it thi way ha an imply reference while notation such a ha an explicit reference for power db p measure p reference for amplitude db a measure a reference be for bel which be a standard term for a log ratio to the base name after alexander graham bell a bel be of a bel it ha nothing to do with the bell telephone company except for the common founder name the small be per si notation convention i do know anyone that be crucify for mess it up common reference for audio be dbm milliwatt acros ohm dbv volt vu a zero on the vu meter dbm pro gear line level vu consumer gear line level often time a power amp vu meter will be align use the rat power of the amp a the db point it be all do to whatever reference be reasonable for the application or moment note that in a circuit with a give and maybe unknown linear impedance if the amplitude go up so many decibel the power will also increase the same amount thi proof can be do with the above two identity and ohm law dave medin phone w ssd networking h intergraph corp internet dtmedin huntsville al uucp uunet ingr catbyte dtmedin everywhere you look at least around my office the opinion express here be mine or those of my machine
