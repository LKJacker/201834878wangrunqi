from chri christian reisel subject re what do nuclear site cooling tower do in john eaton write during the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough to melt when thi happen the liquid uranium be pump to the cool tower where it be spray into the air contact with the cool outside air will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cool tower floor there it be collect by a clean crew use shop vac and be then reform into pellet for reactor use the next day cooling tower be a lot taller than they really need to be power company be force to make them that tall by some enviromental law that require the raw uranium emision to be hold to under thi law be now under attack by lawyer argue that the should be measure at the edge of the property rather than the edge of the cool tower eliminating thi law will save power company thousand of dollar in concrete cost for new nuke john eaton hp-vcd johne i think you post ymy article day too late april be over i do like nuclear powerplant but i think it not fair to tell such story about them ok let me try to explain what that tower be use to even the modernst nuclear powerplant be only a simple steam-engine it ha an hightech boiler but the rest be still verry verry conventional and if you already visit any condensation powerstation have see the cool tower too if you look at any good book about thermophysic you find a chapter about the carnot-proces which describe how to get energy from a temperature difference and that be the reason for cool tower too you only can get energy if you an temperature gradient that mean that you have steam on the one side and need to cool down the steam you get water again on the other side if you want to get aprox of the energy you or better the uranium bring into the water to let it boil if you only have hot steam on the one and cold steam on the other side you loose much more of the energy and so they cool down the steam to get at least the of energy that carnot will give them the cool tower be for cool the steam the vapor you see be not the steam of the main core circulation because that steam be radioactive the circulation be divide in at least circuit connect about heat exchanger to prevent radioactive pollution of the environment ok the main core is hot but even in the modernst hightemperature reactor htr they only run at deg celsiu thi be still verry far away from uranium melt point which be somewhere around deg celsiu but you have lot of problem with the boiler steel that because at thi temperature the metal be attack by steam and will corrode verry fast thi be only for bwr the new he cool reactor have temperature up to deg celsiu but thi be only experimental i personaly think that nuclear waste should be a low a ever possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the year today mrem and next year mrem wo be mrem at all it accumulate and even in year you still have mrem and i not interest in glow in the night and get child with head thi be my point of view only my christian reisel student of electronic science christian reisel goldammerweg buebingen germany voice fax email pgp pubkey begin p h fe ea ox mmo k vh u m w t q end
