from kludge scott dorsey subject re using generate power on large sound system in article ekv pashdown pete ashdown write i bother the rental shop and audio shop about the problem but most of them have preciou little experience in deal with generate power my suspicion be that i do really need anything larger than and thi could all be resolve with a transformer of some sort nope ymy problem be either be cause by excessive voltage drop in the long cable from the generator or just plain not have enough power i would suspect that those amp be go to draw a lot of current on short peak you can try use larger and shorter cable to the generator or try strap the amp for service and run main cable out which will minimize the line drop if these do work though you go to need a bigger generator i assume that you use well-maintained generator and have watch the voltage output on the generator properly if you do have come out of the unload generator you never get at the other end can anyone offer any advice i want to do a lot of outdoor event thi summer and it would be nice if thi power problem could be resolve easily i be look into buy a power-pack so i could tap into junction box directly but have no idea where to start one that would resolve my generator problem a well would be of high value to me i recommend you talk with an electrician who ha experience in thi sort of work and not with the pro-audio person also i recommend that you do try to tap into junction box at all but hire a license electrician if you do really know what you be do i have to clean up after two person who nearly kill themself play in hot box and it wa much fun scott
