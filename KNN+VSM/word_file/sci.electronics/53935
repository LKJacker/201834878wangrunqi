from henry henry spencer subject re help real time clock standby mode in article mgregory martin john gregory write i be have trouble obtain the specify standby current drain from a real time clock lowest current drain i can acheive at vcc be thi be three time the specify maximum made sure that reset be assert for trlh after powerup and a be low during thi time made sure that there be a cycle on a after the negation of rd or wr during which stby wa assert are any of the input to the chip come from ttl standby-drain spec for cmo chip typically apply only if input be pull all the way down to zero or all the way up to vcc ttl be good at do the former and it wo do the latter at all without help from pullup resistor thi sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable factor because the cmo transistor that be suppose to be off be all the way hard off all work be one man work henry spencer u of toronto zoology kipling henry utzoo henry
