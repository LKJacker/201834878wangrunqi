from kschang kuo-sheng kasey chang subject re how to the disk copy protect in article sjmadsen steve madsen write backupable if restore to the same machine depend on the programmer do use a disk drive characteristic if the user do an upgrade to the machine should reinstall all program any way no document look-up no disk wear-and-tear thi be not a good idea i upgrade my motherboard last fall i would have be quite piss at any software that would have force me to reinstall simply because i change motherboard opinion be understandable i assume you have a tape drive not all of u have about floppy around for backup you know any info in the bio be too volatile to use a a checksum are you go to require that a user re-install all their software if they add of ram to their computer i do that a couple of week ago it in the bio and if software have tell me thi be the machine you instal me on i would never have use that software again really bad idea ram be something you add all the time so no it more like bio manufacturer processor type datum can not be use esp with these new flash rom bio machine with update on a diskette on the other hand to make thi les intrusive it could be disguise a please insert original disk xx a i need file yyyyyy for update it would be perfectly reasonable sort of i do not say that the original would allow only one install the user conscience should do that thi be silly it much easier to loan disk to a friend and let them do an install than to backup ymy copy already on disk and then give them that ymy scheme be go to stop anyone of course it be easier are you say then the original should allow only one install what be ymy point you know how many byte you need to change in x-wing to disable the quiz two ye two and do ask me which one they be do you know any assembly language at all all anyone need to do if find the part of the code that do the quiz and insert a jmp instruction to just completely skip it not that difficult really and there be very little that commpany can do to stop thi type of thing using pklite or some similar utility would help but only if the result compress exe be tag a uncompressable i know and assembly quite well thank you i know exactly which two byte need to be change i have the code to do them too i just say do ask me which one i do say i do know what that mean such hack can be easily discourage by add anti-patching code which do a self-check upon execution and refuse to load if crc do not match value store encrypt of course in the program it could be claim a a part of anti-viru code and it would not be far from the truth what i believe the company should do be implement the above plu a special patch once the user register that loudly exclaim upon bootup registered to xxxxx addres city state zip and disable the above thi be by far the best idea you present in ymy post making it plainly obviou who register be go to stop casual pirate but the determine one be just go to answer joe blow to the question of what ymy name so thi wo stop them in the long run did anyone read what i write that be not what i write or mean what i say wa the program should have certain restriction such a the restrict-to-one-machine until the program be register with the manufacturer the manufacturer will then supply the then-proven-legitimate-user with a patch that will disable the restriction and proudly proclaim the legal copy with the registered to xxx screen pirate be alway go to win thi fight they simply have more time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme of course they will but that wa not my point the purpose of copy protection be to discourage casual pirate oh can i have a copy of that sure here and the le sophisticate pirate let look for all those call to any one determine enough to break copy protection can and will succeed they can alway backtrace the entire load-sequence of the program the point of copy protection be to make such attempt take a long a possible while not intrude upon the use or to minimize such intrusion of legitimate use pirate who see copy protection a a challenge love break them and no amount of copy protection will stop them but the rest of u will be stop how many of these hardcore pirate be there compare to rest of u not that many kasey chang
