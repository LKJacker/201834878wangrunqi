from vanderby david vanderbyl subject re lead acid battery concrete neal neal howard write the concrete floor accelerate the problem because it be a heat sink and a colder lead-acid battery self-discharge at a slightly faster rate that why the old wife tale of sit it on a piece of wood on the floor work to help keep from kill the battery a fast it insulate the battery thermally it you set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam it will self-discharge even slower there be a number of inaccuracy here in fact a colder battery will self-discharge more slowly thi be why battery should be store in a cool dry place an battery place on concrete do not become colder than one place on wood the battery the wood and the concrete will all be at the same general temperature ignore temperature fluctuation and thu none will effect the other the best thing would be to attach a small load such a a small transistor radio with the volume turn down low and leave it on constantly but also trickle-charge it every couple day too to shallow cycle the charge in the battery such mild exercise of a lead-acid battery be the next best thing to completely remove the electrolyte for storage there be no need to the battery just keep it charge a trickle charger will do the job stuff delete
