from behnke behnke subject re peltier effect heat pump in article snap paj paul johnson write i wa have a look through a couple of component catalogue when i come acros a range of peltier effect heat pump intend for cool component for those who have not hear of thi effect you put a current through one of these device and it pump heat from one side to the other reverse the current and you reverse the effect i think a temperature difference can give you an emf a well anyway it strike me that you could make a nice box for picnic with one of these a power regulator a thermostat and a couple of heat sink the biggest device can shift with an efficiency of which ai bad although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hmy so-called cool-hot box have be advetised for several year i recall damark advertise them in a recent catalog problem with the unit be they do a job of keep food the peliter device use just do seem to have enough punch to keep up if you want something hot you need to heat it up before you put it in the box and end up hour later with food that only moderately warm same go for cold item unfortunately the catalogue do list anything more than the basic spec a a heat pump i imagine that you would get a back-emf a the temperature gradient acros the device increase if so presumably it power decrease a the back-emf increase until eventually we have a steady state with no current be consume assume no leakage if so then the final temperature difference between the two side could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more although that would be a lousy way to control it what i would like to know be are the above guess correct what be the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device i just want to be sure that my coolbox be not go to get warm too fast when i unplug it probably be better off get a good coleman tm cooler and stock up on blue ice block how do a peltier effect heat pump actually work it look like magic why do they use these thing in domestic same a above not enough punch in them to thing thank in advance paul paul johnson paj tel ext these idea and other like them can be have gec-marconi research be not for each from any reputable idealist responsible for my opinion mike behnke senior quid est illuidin aqua fermi nat accel lab equipment suuport batavium il computing div pistrix pistrix behnke my opinion be my own not of the lab so if you do like them call
