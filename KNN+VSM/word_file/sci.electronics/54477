from subject re microcontroller question for newcomer do anyone have recommendation on whether a smart datum print spooler digital sample etc would be better implement with a dma chip or a dedicate microcontroller essentially what i be try to decide be the best way to handle move datum from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use by the smart datum which dma or microcontroller chip would be best to use fast cheap and easy to obtain would be nice but i wo limit my choice to only those that fit those characteristic even an under would do what i want but i be sure there be a better alternative like a microcontroller with onchip e eprom so i essentially want to hear about all dma and microcontroller that be simple to interface and will move datum from one place to another while monitor a few line jeff white
