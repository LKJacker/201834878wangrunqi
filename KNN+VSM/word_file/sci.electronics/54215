from billn bill nelson subject re power signal surge in home drand dougla s rand write ham can legally run up to watt it be very unlikely however that a ham would be run that kind of power from a car ham rig not possible either you need about a amp alternator for just the amplifier i can just see it you need to slow down on a downgrade so you hit the push to talk button well amp anyway transmission be generally for a short interval the battery would supply the rest of course if you transmit too much you would run the battery down it really would not be that much of a brake even at efficiency watt would only consume horsepower bill
