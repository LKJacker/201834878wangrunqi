from paj paul johnson subject peltier effect heat pump i wa have a look through a couple of component catalogue when i come acros a range of peltier effect heat pump intend for cool component for those who have not hear of thi effect you put a current through one of these device and it pump heat from one side to the other reverse the current and you reverse the effect i think a temperature difference can give you an emf a well anyway it strike me that you could make a nice box for picnic with one of these a power regulator a thermostat and a couple of heat sink the biggest device can shift with an efficiency of which ai bad although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hmy unfortunately the catalogue do list anything more than the basic spec a a heat pump i imagine that you would get a back-emf a the temperature gradient acros the device increase if so presumably it power decrease a the back-emf increase until eventually we have a steady state with no current be consume assume no leakage if so then the final temperature difference between the two side could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more although that would be a lousy way to control it what i would like to know be are the above guess correct what be the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device i just want to be sure that my coolbox be not go to get warm too fast when i unplug it how do a peltier effect heat pump actually work it look like magic why do they use these thing in domestic thank in advance paul paul johnson paj tel ext these idea and other like them can be have gec-marconi research be not for each from any reputable idealist responsible for my opinion
