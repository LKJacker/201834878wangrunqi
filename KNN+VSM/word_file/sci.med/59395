from banschbach subject re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article bgm rind david rind write in article banschbach write oxygen just like it do in the vagina a much stuff a there be in the lay pres about l acidophilu and vaginal yeast infection i really amaze that someone ha not do a clinical trial yet to check it out i mention thi study a couple of time now ingestion of yogurt contain lactobacillu acidophilu a prophylaxi for candidal vaginitis annal of internal medicine do you have a problem with the study because they use yogurt rather than capsule of lactobacillu even though it have positive result the study wa a crossover trial of daily ingestion of ounce of yogurt there wa a mark decrease in infection while woman be ingest the yogurt problem with the study include very small number patient enrol and many protocol violation only patient be analyze still the difference in rate of infection between the two group wa so large that the study remain fairly believable david rind david thi study look like a good one gordon rubenfeld do a medline search and also send me the same reference through e-mail since commercial yogurt do not alway have a good lactobacillu a or bulgaricu culture a negative find would not have be too informative thi be often the reason why lactobacillu acidophilu tablet be recommend rather than yogurt i gues the next question be why would thi introduction of good bacterium back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida bloom if the anu wa not serve a a candida reservoir a fact that gordon r vehementy deny i see two possible theory one the l acidophilu which be a facultatively anaerobic bacterium could make it through the gut and colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida thi would not explain the reoccurance of candida bloom in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion wa stop though the other be that the additional bacterium in the intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the fece and candida loose it major food source getting lactobacillu acidophilu to colonize the vaginal tract where it be normally find would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal yeast bloom though an acetic acid lactobacillu acidophilu douche ha be use to get thi effect but i not see any such treatment report in the medical literature thi would be an example of physician conduct their own clinical trial to try to come up with treatment that help their patient when thi be do in private practice the result be rarely if ever publish it wa the hallmark of medicine until the modern age emerge with clinical trial it really raise a big question do the medical profession cast out the adventerou few who try new treatment to help patient or do it look the other way thi particular issue be really a very simple one since no real dangerou therapy be involve even the anti-fungal be not all that dangerou but there be some area like edtum chelation therapy where the fire be pretty hot and somebody could get burn it really tough do i follow only well establish protocol and then give up if they do work that well or do it try something that look like it will work but ha be prove to work yet my stand be to consider other treatment possibility especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient getting good bacterium back into the gut after antibiotic treatment be one treatment possibility the other be get l acidophilu into the vaginal tract of a woman who be have a problem with recur yeast infection marty b
