from banschbach subject depression some of the md in thi newsgroup have be rid my butt pretty good maybe in some case with good reason in thi post on depression i lay it all out i continue to post here because i think that i have some knowledge that could be useful once you have read thi post you should know where i come from when i post again in the future in article lchaplyn lida chaplynsky write a family member of mine be suffer from a severe depression bring on by menopause a well a a mental break down she be be treat with halydol with some succes but the treatment be provide through her psychiatrist be not satisfactory someone suggest contact a nutritionist to discus alternative treatment since she be sensitive to medication i think thi be a good suggestion but do know where to begin if anyone can suggest a philly area nutritionist or else some literature to read i appreciate it lida i can emphasize with ymy situation both my wife and i suffer from bout of depression her wa bring on by breast cancer and mine wa a rebound stres reaction to her modify radical mastectomy and chemotherapy lida i use my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six month of chemotherapy with the approval of her oncologist when severe depression set in a few month after the chemo stop i try to use supplement to bring her out of it i have cure her pm use supplement and i really think that i know enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression a well it do work and she wa put on prozac by her oncologist two winter ago three year after by wife breast cancer i get hit with severe depression pretty typical and one reason why many marriage break up after breast cancer or another stressor i try to take care of it for several month with supplementation did work my internist end up put me on prozac i wa go to give you a list of several study that have be do use niacin folate and to cure depression i not go to do that because all you would be do be fly blind like i wa lida i do believe that depression can have a dietary component but the problem be that you need to know exactly what the problem be and then use an approach which will fix the problem for chemotherapy i know exactly what drug be go to be use and exactly what nutrient would be affect same thing for pm i wa fly blind for both of these stressor but the literature that i use to devise a treatment program wa pretty good depression be just too complicate what you really need be a nutritional scan thi be not a diet analysi but an analysi of ymy body nutrient reserve for every vitamin and mineral except vitamin c you have a reserve the rda be not design to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserve full it be only design to keep them from be empty which would cause clinical pathology stres will increase ymy need for many vitamin and mineral thi be when ymy reserve become very important lida without ymy permission i go to use ymy post a a conduit to try to explain to the reader in thi group and scus med where i come from i have teach a course on human nutrition in one of the osteopathic medical school for ten year now i write my own textbook because none wa available what i teach be not a rehash of biochemistry i preach nutrient reserve ye my lecture in thi course be refer to by my student a sermon here be what i cover indroduction and carbohydrate lipid protein i protein ius energy balance evaluation of nutritional statu i a clinical perspective evaluation of nutritional statu ius evaluation of nutritional a biochemical perspective statu iius homework assignment using the nutritionist iv diet and fitnes analysi software program weight control food fad and fact age-related change in nutrient requirement food additive contaminant and cancer drug-nutrient interaction mineral and water balance sodium potassium and chloride calcium magnesium and phosphoru iron zinc and copper iodine and fluoride other trace mineral vitamin a vitamin e vitamin d and k vitamin c thiamin and niacin riboflavin and pyridoxine pantothenic and folic acid biotin and other nutrient factor enteral nutrition parenteral nutrition every three year i spend my entire summer review the medical literature to find material that i can use in my nutrition textbook i last do thi in the summer of i read everything that i can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handout which be bind in three separate book that have and page opposite each page of write text which i write myself i pull figure table and graph from variou copyright source since thi material be only be use for educational purpose i can get around the copyright law so far i can not send thi material out to newsgroup reader a i be ask to do i be now in the proces of try to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab thi be the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that i need to make my education program complete thi lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamin and mineral that be know to be require in human the mayo clinic already use a similiar lab to design supplement program for their cancer patient cancer treatment center of america which be a private for-profit organization with hospital in illinoi and oklahoma tulsa also operate a nutritional assessment clinical lab i also believe that the pritikin clinic in californium ha a similiar lab setup for physician read thi post i would suggest that you get the new clinical nutrition textbook that ha just be publish feb by mosby i have be use alper manual of nutritional therapeutic a little brown series book a a supplemental text for my course but alper be gear more to residency train two have write thi new clinical nutrition textbook and it be gear more toward medical student education and it do a good job of cover the lab test that can be run to ass a patient nutritional statu let me quote a few sentence from the preface of thi new text so-called nutrition specialist be in reality gastroenterologist hematologist or pediatrician who just happen to profes some knowledge of nutrition a it relate to their field of practice unfortunately about two third of the medical school in the united state require no formal instruction in nutrition but time and medical practice have change more than half of the lead cause of death in thi country be nutrition relate thi monograph should accomplish the follow two objective it should complement ymy medical train by emphasize the relevance of nutrition to ymy medical practice and it should heighten ymy awarenes of nutrition a a medical speciality that be vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of disease of essentially every organ system roland l weinsier md drph lida my advise to you be that you tell ymy family member to try to find a physician who ha an understand of the role that vitamin and mineral ye even magnesium may play a role in depression play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run menopause be often a time when woman suffer depression there be a lot of hormonal change that be occur but they be not the same one that occur during pm a nutritionist may also be able to help not too long ago a poster mention that hi nutritionist have diagnose a selenium deficiency base on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test the specific test for the selenium reserve most clinical lab will not run thi test and i advise him to try to make sure that the lab that do the test wa certify there be also a lot of hair and nail analysi lab setup to do trace mineral analysi but these lab be not regulate check of these lab use certify standard and also those do water lead analysi show some pretty shoddy test wa go on if you or anyone else find someone who will run these speciality nutrition test make sure that they be use a lab that ha be certify under clium the clinical laboratory improvement act a diet analysi may be helpful since many nutrient reserve have be show to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake a monitor by food log and software analysi nutritionist iv and other software program but there be still about half of the nutrient require by human that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve statu until we have more nutritional assessment clinical lab in operation in the and physician who have be train how to use the nutritional profile that these lab provide to devise a treatment approach that use diet change and supplementation anti-depressant will probably continue to be the best approach
