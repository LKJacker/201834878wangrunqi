from fulk mark fulk subject re science and methodology wa homeopathy tradition in article sasghm gary merrill write in article fulk mark fulk write i do think extra-scientific be a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundary of science except a a propose definien extra-rational be a better phrase in fact there be quite a number of well-known case of extra-rational consideration drive science in a useful direction yeah but the problem with hold up the extra-rational example a exemplar or a refutation of well found methodology be that you run smack up against such unuseful direction a lysenko such extra rational case be curiosity not guide to methodology a ha be note before there be the distinction between motivation and method no experimental result should be accept unles it be describe in sufficient detail to be replicate and the replication do indeed reproduce the result no theoretical argument should be accept unles it be present in sufficient detail to be follow and reasonable knowlegeable person agree with the force of the logic but person try experiment and pursue argument for all sort of crazy reason irrational motivation be not just curiousity they be a large part of the history of science there be a couple of negative point to make here a theory of qi could conceivably become accept without direct verification of the existence of qi for example quark be an accept part of the standard model of physic with no direct verification what would be need would be a theory base on qi that predict medical reality better than the alternative the central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment a long a there wa a sufficient body of experimental datum that the qi theory predict better than any other i would hold my breath wait for the triumph of qi though i do think that there be even a coherent theory base on it much le a theory that explain anything at all better than modern biology and it be hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verify the existence of qi science ha not historically progress in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence most experiment be carry out and interpret in pre-existing theoretical framework the theoretical controversy of the day determine which experiment get do overall there be a huge messy affair of personal jealousy crazy motivation petty hatred and the like that determine which experiment and which computation get do what keep it go forward be the critical function of science result do count unles they can be replicate the whole system be a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test the generate part can be totally irrational a long a the test part work properly pasteur could believe whatever he like about chemical activity and crystal but even mitscherlich have to agree that racemic acid crystal be hand that when you separate them by handednes you get two chemical that rotate polarize light in opposite direction and the right-rotating version wa indistinguishable from tartaric acid pasteur irrational motivation have lead to a replicable and important result thi be where lysenko creationist etc fail they have usually not even produce coherent theory that predict much of anything when their theory do predict and be contradict by experiment they do not concede the point and modify their theory rather they try to suppres the result lysenko or try to divert attention to other evidence they think support their position creationist mark a fulk university of rochester computer science department fulk
