particle linked to seriou asthma attack american lung association a new study publish by the american lung association ha show that surprisingly low concentration of airborne particle can send person with asthma rush to emergency room for treatment the seattle-based study show that roughly one in eight emergency visit for asthma in that city wa link to exposure to particulate air pollution the actual exposure level record in the study be far below those deem unsafe under federal air quality law person with asthma have inflame airway and airborne particle tend to exacerbate that inflammation say joel schwartz of the environmental protection agency who wa the lead author of the study when person be on the threshold of have a seriou asthma attack particle can push them over the edge the seattle study correlate month of asthma emergency room visit with daily level of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of micron or le these finer particle be consider hazardou because they be small enough penetrate into the lung city be consider out of compliance with clean air law if the average concentration of exceed microgram per cubic millimeter of air in seattle however a link between fine particle and asthma wa find at level a low a microgram the author conclude that for every microgram increase in the four-day average of the odd of someone with asthma need emergency treatment increase by percent the find be publish in the april american review of respiratory disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung association medical section the study be the latest in a series of recent report to suggest that particulate matter be a greatly under appreciate health threat a study by dr schwartz and dougla dockery of harvard find that particle may be cause roughly premature death each year in the united state other study have link particulate matter to increase respiratory symptom and bronchitis in child government official and the medium be still very focus on ozone say dr schwartz but more and more research be show that particle be bad actor a well one problem in set standard for particulate air pollution be that pmio be difficult to study unlike other regulate pollutant such a ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter be a complex and vary mixture of substance include carbon hydrocarbon dust and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april acid aerosol researcher ca put person in exposure chamber to study the effect of particulate air pollution say dr schwartz we have no way of duplicate the typical urban mix of particle consequently most of what be know about particulate ha be learn through population-based research like the seattle study given that the epa current priority be to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standard the agency be unlikely to reexamine the standard any time soon until change be make there appear to be little person with asthma can do to protect themself from airborne particle in some area you can get report on air quality but the report only cover the pollutant that be closest to violate it standard and that rarely particulate matter say dr schwartz however do have to be near it violation range to be unhealthy hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april nih consensu development conference on melanoma the national institute of health consensu development conference

fmy type of cancer center basic science cancer center which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer center which focu on clinical research comprehensive cancer center which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer center which specialize in cancer prevention and control research although some cancer center exist in the late and the it wa the national cancer act of that authorize the establishment of new cancer center a well a continue support for exist one the passage of the act also dramatically transform the center structure and broaden the scope of their mission to include all aspect of basic clinical and cancer control research over the next two decade the center program grow progressively in there be comprehensive cancer center in the nation today there be of these institution all of which meet specific ncus criterium for comprehensive statu to attain recognition from the ncus a a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pa rigorou peer review under guideline newly establish in the eight criterium for comprehensivenes include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific field such a biology and molecular genetic a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research find into clinical practice moreover five of the criterium for comprehensive statu go significantly beyond that require for attain a cancer center support grant also refer to a a or core grant the mechanism of choice for support the infrastructure of a cancer center operation these criterium encompas strong participation in nci-designated high-priority clinical trial significant level of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activity all of which be fund by a variety of source the other type of cancer center also have special characteristic and capability for organize new program of research that can exploit important new find or addres timely research question hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april of the nci-designated cancer center be of the basic science type these center engage almost entirely in basic research although some center engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigator and in cooperative project with industry to generate medical application from new discovery in the laboratory clinical cancer center in contrast focu on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliate clinical research institution into their overall research program there be such center today finally consortium cancer center of which there be one be uniquely structure and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research these center interface with state and local public health department for the purpose of achieve the transfer of effective prevention and control technique from their research find to those institution responsible for implement population-wide public health program consortium center also be heavily engage in collaboration with institution that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospital within a network of cooperate institution in clinical trial together the nci-designated cancer center continue to work toward create new and innovative approach to cancer research and through interdisciplinary effort to effectively move thi research from the laboratory into clinical trial and
