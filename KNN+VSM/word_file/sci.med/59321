from rhaller rich haller subject resound hear aid theory a i understand it the follow be base on copy i wa give of some article publish in hearing instrument i would appreciate any comment about thi and other technology for hear aid the resound system wa develop on the basi of some research at at t and appear to take a different approach from other aid it appear to me that a new aid like the widex just use a more flexible and programmable version of the classical approach of amplify some part of the spectrum more than other and add some compression to try and help out in situation the major difference in the resound approach be that it divide the spectrum into low and high frequency split point be programmable apparently base on the fact that lot of vowel information can be find in the low frequency while the important consonant information unfortunately for me be in the high frequency the two band then be treat with different compression scheme which be programable they have also develop a new fit algorythm that build on what they call growth of loudnes thi latter be interest and fit my own personal experience though i think the phrase be missleading what appear to be the case be that a you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hear los the deficit become progresslively le compare to normal and by the time you reach the loud point the sensitivity curf appear to converge thi mean that if you just boost all sound level you be overload at the high end for person with hear loss hence what you want be progressively le amplification a the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point you want to boost low volume sound more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency part of the spectrum specially for someone like me who be relatively normal up to cp and then fall off a cliff aid with simple compressor do descriminate between energy in the low and high frequency and can therefor useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency component particularly impressive wa the resound performance with whisper speech and in simulate restaurant noise situation rich haller rhaller university of oregon eugene or usa
