from banschbach subject vitamin a and infection i send gordon r my post on protein vitamin c and vitamin a prior to post on internet a a professional courtesy somehow i manage to delete my vitamin a post from my text file gordon r have promise to send it back to me but he pretty mad at me right now so i just retype it since dig through all my reference be very time consume take me all day for that pm post i not go to cite any reference gordon r ha them i go to include some of the material from weinsier and morgan new nutrition textbook which wa not in my original material to point out that what i go to say ha some support in the medical community diet ha be know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long time protein ha alway have the biggest role in infection and i already cover the role of protein in protect you against infection now i go to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in the a far a infection be concern vitamin a when vitamin a wa originally discover it wa commonly refer to a the anti-infection vitamin many person linu pauling be one have decide to take thi title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c which i already cover big mistake in my opinion vitamin a be also get a reputation a an anti-cancer vitamin with good reason the ncus currently ha numerou clinical trial in progress to see if vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it a well it role in both cancer and infection be almost identical but not quite vitamin a come in two completely different form retinol and beta-carotene retinol be the animal form and it toxic beta-carotene be the plant form and it completely nontoxic both retinol and betum carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile be present the liver store all of ymy retinol and dole it out for other tissue to use by synthesize retinol bind protein rbp a normal human adult liver should have to of retinol store we be bear with in my liver autopsy ha show that about of american die with the same or le amount of vitamin a a they be bear with if you do believe that nutritional reserve like that of retinol in the liver be important then thi low vitamin a reserve be not go to affect you but if you believe like i do that the nutrient reserve be important then there be a problem with vitamin a in the the rda for vitamin a in an adult male be re or of vitamin a for adult feamle it re or of vitamin a diet survey show that most american be get thi amount of vitamin a either retinol or beta-carotene from their diet but the nrc national research council wa go to release a new rda table in that have the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raise c to per day and a to per day for adult male that report and it recommendation wa kill why concern over the increase supplementation wa the main reason rda be set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserve full many scientist in the feel that the time ha come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move toward the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good datum now that show that nutrient reserve be extremely important during period of stres the nutritonal concervative win that battle and a new group of scientist be collect to come out with the rda list which lower the rda for several nutrient and move the dietary guideline back to where they be when we first start in the get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserve we know from autopsy that only about of american have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserve to i preach nutrient reserve to my student and tell them to measure them in their patient but for vitamin a only a liver biopsy or autopsy datum will tell you how much somebody ha store we can tell very easily if someone ha overfill hi or her liver with vitamin a by measure the serium retinol level level above be highly suggestive that you have fill ymy liver with vitamin a and it time to stop take retinol the normal range of serum retinol will be hypervitaminosi a be diagnose with a serum retinol level of or higher interpretation of diagnostic test wallach a little brown series book thi level of vitamin a in blood mean that medical attention be necessary due to vitamin a toxicity weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin a toxicity than do wallach a you will see later in thi post between and you should have plenty of warn that it time to eliminate the retinol from ymy diet headache rednes of the skin hair los joint pain i tell all my student that will use vitamin a in their practice that they have better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there be clear sign that the liver be full you will never really know if the patient need the vitamin a because you can not measure the pool in liver but you will alway know when it time to stop just like in those vitamin a for pm study beta-carotene can be take to fill up ymy liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol that occur in both ymy gut and ymy liver will slow down stop in the liver and slow down in the gut when ymy liver be full of retinol but take beta-carotene a the source of retinol take a very long time to fill the liver up i see estimate of year if you be in the that only ha a much a you be bear with in ymy liver one other problem with beta-carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert a much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that do thi conversion require zinc in addition the release of retinol from the liver be a zinc dependent proces so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin a deficit even if ymy liver ha plenty of vitamin a now what do vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection the body use vitamin a retinol for many different thing vision the first to be nail down and where you see overt clinical pathology use the aldehyde retinal and alcohol retinol form of vitamin a reproduction use the retinol form and some retinal infection and cancer protection use retinoic acid how do you convert retinol which ymy white blood cell and the mucosal cell get from blood to retinoic acid you use enzyme one of which require vitamin c thi be why pauling ha try to pull the title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin a vitamin c do play a role in infection interferon production for example but it biggest role be the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid if you increase ymy intake of vitamin c you will increase ymy formation of retinoic acid but retinoic acid can not be convert back to retinol a retinal can and once it form it use and then lose to the body thi be why the nrc group want to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda most person take large amount of vitamin c really think that they be help themself if they do have much vitamin a in their liver and they be not also increase their intake of vitamin a they actually do themself more harm than good retinoic acid function in white blood cell to promote antibody formation in the mucu membrane it be the main factor in promote good mucu production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectiou agent from enter the blood system the mucu membrane be refer to a the first line defense against infection for cancer retinoic acid ha be show to act a a cell brake it counteract the effect of cell promoter which stimulate cell to divide cancer ha two distinct step dna alteration and cell promotion for cell that normally divide all the time promoter be not that important but for lung and breast tissue which do not normally divide promoter be real important in the malignant proces thi be the major reason why the ncus ha so many different clinical trial in progress use retinol beta-carotene chronic infection irritation of the mucu membrane be a signal that vitamin a may not be adequate i tell my student that any patient who walk into their office with a complaint of chronic infection ha to be work up for vitamin a along with the other factor that medicine already ha on it list of cause for chronic infection i drive thi home in my course at the osteopathic college in tulsa when i teach at the allopathic medical school in tulsa ou branch campu and when i give cme lecture dark adaptation be the best clinical test for vitamin a statu since night vision be impact when liver reverve drop to of retinol the serum level of retinol can also be use but it do not drop until liver reserve drop below to asking a patient if they have trouble see at night be a good initial screen if cataract be rule out in one study do on spanish-american where serum retinol level be measure of the sample population have a serum retinol level below a more study be do on serum retinol level in population group of the that have have a history of high infection rate we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rate and low serum retinol level what do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a here be excerpt from their book vitamin a function in vision in the forrm of retinol it be necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and be require for reproduction embryonic development and bone growth protein-calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin a retinaldehyde be convert to retinoic acid which ha biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a statu be to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum the normal range for vitamin a content for a child be to lower value be indicator of deficiency or deplete body store serum level greater than be indicative of toxic level of vitamin a dark adaptation test and electroretinogram measurement be also useful but difficult to perform on young child rapidly proliferate tissue be sensitive to vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state the bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat gland be adversely affect a daily intake of more than about of retinol be not advise and chronic use of amount over can result in a dry and itch skin desquamation erythematou dermatitis hair los joint pain chap lip hyperostoi bony depositis headach anorexium edema and fatigue they recommend of retinol vium im injection in child for vitamin a deficiency but do not discus treatment for adult their toxic serum retinol level be very conservative i recommend that my student try in adult that be have problem with chronic infection they have to rule out a zinc deficit first by get an rbc zinc run or if their clinical lab ca run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin a at per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pull the patient into the office on a regular basi to run a serum retinol both elaine and jon find doctor who use a much higher dose of vitamin a recall that the pm paper be use to of vitamin a i do suggest that my student use these high dose if you want to fill the liver up fast a part of a clinical trial and be monitor the serum retinol level then you would be okay but my knowledge of the vitamin a literature suggest to me that for patient with a demonstrate vitamin a deficit dark adapatation test or serum retinol will provide a good and steady improvement a long a zinc and vitamin c statu be good without have to worry about toxicity if they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol but vitamin a retinol should never be give in high dose to woman who could become pregnant since vitamin a show teratogenicity toward the human fetu the dose need to show thi effect on the develop fetu be of retinol per day beta-carotene will never have thi effect on the human fetu could just take beta-carotene instead of retinol supplement help ye but the effect will take a long time to develop my advise be to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it full vitamin a be probably one nutrient that be better off leave to prescription by doctor but when we have the in thi newsgroup jump all over me and other doctor that propose the use of vitamin a supplement for treat patient with chronic sinu and gi distres i think that the most prudent option be to keep vitamin a in the otc market but require manufactor to provide package insert to educate the general public about the danger of vitamin a supplementation marty b
