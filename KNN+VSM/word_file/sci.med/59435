from nigel allen subject new method for diagnosing alzheimer disease discovered here be a pres release from huntington medical research institute new method for diagnosing alzheimer disease discovered at huntington medical research institute result to be reported to national desk health writer contact john lockhart or belinda gerber or for the huntington medical research institute lo angele april a new method for diagnose and measure chemical imbalance in the brain which lead to alzheimer disease and other dementia ha be discover by researcher at the huntington medical research institute hmrus in pasadena calif result of their research will be report in the may issue of the scientific journal radiology using an advance form of magnetic resonance image mrus call magnetic resonance spectroscopy mr a research team lead by brian d ros d phil conduct a study on elderly patient who be believe to be suffer from some form of dementium the exam use standard mrus equipment fit with special software develop at hmrus call clinical proton mr clinical proton mr be easily apply give doctor confirmatory diagnosis in le than minute an automate version of clinical proton mr call proton brain examination probe reduce the examination time yet further provide confirmatory diagnosis in le than minute by comparison the current standard of care in test for alzheimer disease call for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological test which can be very upset to the patient be not definitive and can only be confirm by autopsy in addition to alzheimer disease the new clinical proton mr exam may have application in diagnose other dementia include aids-related dementium parkinson disease and huntington disease we develop a simple test which can be administer quickly and relatively inexpensively use exist mrus equipment fit with either the mr or probe software say dr ros add thi will help physician to diagnose alzheimer earlier and intervene with therapeutic before the progression of the disease cause further damage to the delicate inner work of the brain dr ros and hi hmrus team measure a family of chemical in the brain know a inositol and myo-inositol mi act a a marker in the study in comparison to healthy patient those diagnose with alzheimer show a percent increase in mi while their level of another chemical call n-acetylaspartate naa wa significantly lower indicate a los of brain-stimulating neuron believe to be associate with the progression of the disease current drug therapy for alzheimer disease be widely consider to be inadequate thi be attributable dr ros believe to the theory that alzheimer be cause by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cell thi belief ha be adhere to over the last year and consequently most drug to treat alzheimer be base on the change receptor for acetylcholine physician have a real need for a test to differentiate alzheimer from other dementia to provide the patient and hi or her family with a firm diagnosi and to monitor future treatment protocol for the treatment of thi disease for thi reason we consider thi test a major advancement in medicine say bruce miller a note neurologist at harbor-ucla mr researcher and a co-author of the study other member of the hmrus research team include rex a moat truda shonk thoma ernst and suzanne woolley the probe software can be fit on the approximately general electric mrus unit currently in use in the united state and will be configure for other manufacturer mrus unit soon for interview with dr ros advance copy of the radiology may issue and other information please contact john lockhart or belinda gerber for hmrus at or q a on alzheimer disease what be alzheimer disease and how be it cause alzheimer disease ad be an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first describe in by the german neuropathologist aloi alzheimer a the disease progress it lead to los of memory and mental function follow by change in personality los of control of bodily function and eventually death how many person do it affect alzheimer disease affect an estimate million adult in the united state and be the fourth lead cause of death take approximately life each year while alzheimer debilitate it victim it be equally devastate both emotionally and financially for patient family ad be the most common cause of dementium in adult symptom worsen every year and death usually occur within year of initial onset what be it sign and symptom although the cause of ad be not know two risk factor have be identify advance age and genetic predisposition the risk of develop ad be le than one percent before the age of yar old but increase steeply in each successive decade of life to reach percent by the age of in patient with familial ad immediate family relative have a percent chance of develop ad one of it first symptom be severe forgetfulnes cause by short-term memory los dr herman weinreb of the school of medicine at new york university say whether forgetfulnes be a seriou symptom or not be largely a matter of degree and suggest the follow criterium forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently be normal forgetting the name of a love one be seriou forgetting where you leave ymy key be normal forgetting how to get home be seriou doctor suggest that person with severe symptom should be evaluate in order to rule out alzheimer disease and other form of dementium canada remote system toronto ontario
