from dsew david sewell subject and water bio-availability do anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine or the two in combination can reduce the body ability to make use of available water i have kind of an odd experience on a group hike recently become dehyrated after about hour of rigorou hike despite have bring gallon of water c liter i drink close to twice a much a anyone else and no one else wa dehydrate i do think general physical condition wa an issue since i wa in at least the middle of the pack in term of general stamen so far a i could tell it may be that i just plain need more water than most person but i be wonder if theophylline ephedrine might be aggravate thing i take a couple of primatene tablet during the hike to control asthma mg ephedrine mg theophylline i gather that both those drug be diuretic so now i wonder do that mean they can reduce the body ability to utilize available water would it be a particularly stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather exercise i alway assume diuresi just mean you urinate a lot but that wa the case yesterday
