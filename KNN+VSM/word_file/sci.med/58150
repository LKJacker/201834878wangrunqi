from edwin barkdoll subject re blindsight in article geb gordon bank write in article werner john werner write in article geb gordon bank write explain i think there be type of cone equivalent to rgb you basically right but i think there be just type one be sensitive to red and green and the other be sensitive to blue and yellow thi be why the two most common kind of color-blindnes be red-green and blue-yellow ye i remember that now well in that case the cone be indeed color sensitive contrary to what the original respondent have claim i not sure who the original respondent wa but to reiterate cone respond to particular portion of the spectrum just a rod respond to certain part of the visible spectrum bluegreen in my case reddish in certain amphibium just a the hoseshoe crab limulu polyphemu photoreceptor respond to a certain portion of the spectrum etc it be a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with be color sensitive however the two be not synonymou so in sum and to beat a dead horse when the output of a cone be match for number of absorb photon irrespective of the absorb photon wavelength the cone output be indistinguishable cone be simply detector with different spectral sensitivity and be not any more color sensitive than be rod ommatidium or other photoreceptor color vision arise because output of receptor which sample different part of the spectrum cone in thi case be process centrally the handwave be intentional i work and publish research on rod and cone for over year so the adherence to the belief that cone can detect color be frustrate but do take my word for it i reposting a few excellent article together with two rather good but oldish color vision text the text robert boynton human color vision holt rhiehart and winston leo m hurvich color vision sinauer associate the original article baylor and hodgkin detection and resolution of visual stimulus by turtle phoreceptor j physiol baylor lamb and yau reponse of retinal rod to single photon j physiol schnapf et al visual transduction in cone of the monkey macaca fasciculari j physiol edwin barkdoll barkdoll edwin barkdoll
