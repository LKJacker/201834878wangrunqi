combat aid it should be note that while aid lead in hasten global health interdependence it be not the only illnes do so disease such a malarium and many respiratory and intestinal pathogen have similarly inhibit the economic development of most of humanity and act to marginalize large population berkley mention the enormou social and economic impact that aid will have on many develop country

administration with a promise of substantial difference in approach to international health and development in general and in particular vice president al gore propose in hi book earth in the balance

other than aid such a malarium and respiratory and intestinal illness have similarly inhibit economic development in develop country and deserve much more attention than they be get berkley disagree with the contention that aid be receive too much attention hiv differ from other disease in most develop country because it be continue to spread for most endemic disease the outcome of neglect intervention for one year be another year of about the same level of needle disease and death but with aid and it increase spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially be much greater intervention in the early part of a rampantly spread epidemic like hiv be highly cost-effective because each individual infection prevent significantly interrupt transmission berkley say he agree with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effect of aid and about the need for political leadership but he conclude that not only be assertive political leadership need in the united state for the aid epidemic but even more so in develop country with high rate of hiv infection and where complacency about the epidemic ha be the rule hicnet medical newsletter page

the national institute of health ha open the first trial of experimental hiv vaccine in child who be infect with the human immunodeficiency viru hiv the viru that cause aid the trial will compare the safety of three hiv experimental vaccine in child recruit from at least site nationwide volunteer must be hiv infect but have no symptom of hiv disease hh secretary donna e shalala say thi initial study can be see a a hopeful milestone in my effort to ameliorate the tragedy of hiv-infected child who now face the certainty they will develop aid anthony s faucus director of the national institute of allergy and infectiou disease and of the nih office of aid research say the trial be the first step in find out whether vaccine can help prevent or delay disease progression in child with hiv who be not yet sick if these vaccine prove to be safe more sophisticate question about their therapeutic potential will be assess in phase ius trial the center for disease control and prevention estimate child in the united state have hiv by the end of the decade the world health organization project million child will be infect worldwide the study will enroll child age month to year old niaid which fund the aid clinical trial group network anticipate conduct the trial at nine actg site around the country and three site participate in the actg but fund by the national institute of child health and human development preliminary evidence from similar study under way in infect adult show that certain vaccine can boost exist hiv-specific immune response and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april stimulate new one it will be several year however before researcher know how these response affect the clinical course of the disease the result from the pediatric trial know a actg will be examine closely for other reason a well thi trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system respond to candidate hiv vaccine say daniel hoth director of niaid division of aid we need thi information to design trial to test whether experimental vaccine can prevent hiv infection in child in the united state most hiv-infected child live in poor inner-city area and more than percent be minority mainly black or hispanic nearly all hiv-infected child acquire the viru from their mother during pregnancy or at birth an infect mother in the united state ha more than a one

aids-related infection by to year of age these infection include severe or frequent bout of common bacterial illness of childhood that can result in seizure pneumonium diarrhea and other symptom lead to nutritional problem and long hospital stay at least half of the child in the trial will be year of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune response of the younger and older participant

medicine will coordinate the trial assist by jame mcnamara medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of niaid division of aid we will compare the safety of the vaccine by closely monitor the child for any side effect to see if one vaccine produce more swell arm or fever for example than another say dr mcnamara we also look at whether low or high dose of the vaccine stimulate immune response or other significant laboratory or clinical effect he emphasize that the small study size preclude compare these response or effect among the three hicnet medical newsletter page volume

evidence that the hiv can cause disease independently news from the national institute of dental research there be new evidence that the human immunodeficiency viru can cause disease independently of it ability to suppres the immune system say scientist at the national institue of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection cause scale skin condition to develop in mouse carry the gene for hiv although the hiv gene be active in the mouse they do not compromise the animal immunity the researcher find thi lead them to conclude that the hiv itself cause the skin disease my find support a grow body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affect the immune system say lead author dr jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research nidr dr kopp and hi colleague describe their study in the march issue of aid research and human retroviruse developing animal model of hiv infection ha be difficult since most animal include mouse can not be infect by the viru to bypas thi problem scientist have develop hiv-transgenic mouse which carry gene for hiv a well a their own genetic material nidr scientist create the transgenic mouse by inject hiv gene into mouse egg and then implant the egg into female mouse the result litter contain both normal and transgenic animal institute scientist have create mouse that carry a complete copy of hiv genetic material in those mouse however become sick and die too soon after birth to study in depth in the present study the scientist use an incomplete copy of hiv which allow the animal to live longer some of the transgenic animal develop scale wart-like tumor on their neck and back other transgenic mouse develop thicken crust skin lesion that cover most of their body resemble psoriasi in human no skin lesion develop in their normal non-transgenic littermate study of tissue take from the wart-like skin tumor show that they be a type of noncancerou tumor call papilloma although the papillomaviru can cause these skin lesion laboratory test show no sign of that viru in the animal tissue sample take from the sick mouse throughout the study reveal the presence of a protein-producing molecule make by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april evidence of hiv protein production prove that the viral gene be turn on or active say dr kopp the scientist find no evidence however of compromise immunity in the mouse no increase in their white blood cell count and no sign of common infection the fact that hiv gene be active but the animal immune system be not suppress confirm that the viru itself wa cause the skin lesion dr kopp say further proof of hiv gene involvement come from a test in which the scientist expose the transgenic animal to ultraviolet light the light increase hiv genetic activity cause papilloma to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increase hiv genetic activity prove the gene be responsible for the skin condition the scientist say no lesion appear on normal mouse expose to the uv light the transgenic mouse use in thi study be develop at nidr by dr peter dickie who be now with the national institute
