from doyle howard r doyle subject re persistent v chronic in article kenneth gilbert write in article rind david rind write in article horace enea write can anyone out there tell me the difference between a persistent disease and a chronic one for example persistent hepatitis v chronic hepatitis i do think there be a general distinction rather there be two class of chronic hepatitis chronic active hepatitis and chronic persistent hepatitis i ca think of any other disease where the term persistent be use with or in preference to chronic much a these two term chronic active and chronic persistent sound fuzzy the actual distinction between the two condition be often fairly fuzzy a well i beg to differ chronic active hepatitis imply that the disease remain active and generally lead to liver failure at the very minimum the patient ha persistently elevate liver enzyme what some call transaminitis chronic persistant hepatitis simply mean that the patient ha hbsag in blood and can transmit the infection but show no evidence of progressive disease if i have to choose i much rather have the persistant type being a chronic hbsag carrier do not necessarily mean the patient ha chronic persistent anything person who be chronic carrier may have no clinical biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosi or hepatocellular carcinoma most case of chronic persistent hepatitis cph be probably the result of a viral infection although in a good number of case the cause can not be determine the diagnosi of cph be make on the basi of liver biopsy it consist of find of portal inflammation an intact periportal limit plate and on occasion isolate focus of intralobular necrosi but in contrast to chronic active hepatitis cah there be no periportal inflammation bridge necrosi or fibrosi cph ha indeed an excellent prognosi if i have to choose between cah and cph there be no question i would also choose cph however a david point out the distinction between the two be not a neat a some of u would have it the histology can sometime be pretty equivocal with biopsy show area compatible with both cph and cah maybe it be a sample problem maybe it be a continuum i do know howard doyle doyle
