from fulk mark fulk subject re science and methodology wa homeopathy tradition in article sasghm gary merrill write in article fulk mark fulk write what be wrong with the above observation be that it explicitly gife the impression and you may not in fact hold thi view that the common perhap even the correct approach for a scientist to follow be to sit around have flight of fancy and scheme on the basi of hi jealousy and petty hatred flight of fancy and other irrational approach be common the crucial thing be not to sit around just have fantasy they be of any use unles they make you do some experiment i know a lot of scientist whose fantasy lead them on to creative work usually they wo admit out loud what the fantasy wa prior to the consumption of a few beer simple example warren jelinek notice an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresi gel of human alu fragment he get very excite hop that he see some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic gene thi fantasy lead him to sequence sample of the band and carry out bind assay the result wa a well-conserved or so bp sequence that occur about time in the human genome unfortunately for warren fantasy it turn out to be a transposon that be present in so many copy because it replicate itself and copy itself back into the genome on the other hand the characteristic of transposon be much elucidate the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase wa recognize and the standard method of recognize human dna wa create other specie have different set of transposon fortunately for me warren and i use to eat dinner at friday all the time it further at least implicitly advance the position that science go forward and it be not clear what thi mean give the context in which it occur by generate in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypothesis and theory that be then weed out vium the critical function of science i not sure that it random but there be no know rational mechanism for generate a rich set of interest hypothesis if you be really work in an unknown area it be unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true under those circumstance the best thing to do be just follow whatever instinct you have if they be wrong you will find out soon enough but at least you will find out something if you try to do experiment at random with no prior conception at all in mind you will probably get nowhere though why thi critical function should be le subject to the non-rational force be a mystery unfortunately the critical function do sometime become hostage to non-rational force then we get variety of pathological science lysenko mirsky opposition to dna-as-gene cold fusion and so forth if experimental design hypothesis creation and theory construction be subject to jealousy and petty hatred then thi must be equally true of the application of any critical function concern replication thi be what lead one ala feyerabend to an anything go view i do agree that thi follow in fact thi be exactly the point at which i disagree with feyerabend it be a most important part of the culture of science that one keep one jealousy out of the referee proces failure there be aplenty but on the whole thing work out another point there be a couple of sense of the phrase experimental design i say that the le rational part be in experimental choice not design alexander fleming proc royal soc choose to look for bacteriophage in hi own mucu for strange reason phage have previously be find in locust diarrhea fleming probably think runny bottom runny nose what the hell it worth a try but hi method of look for phage wa well-designed to detect anything phage-like in fact he find lysozyme true the generation part can be totally irrational but typically it be not anecdote concern instance where a hypothesi seem to have result in some way from a dream or from one political view simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science it be not clear to me what you mean by rational v irrational perhap you can give a few example of surprise experiment that be try out for perfectly rational reason or interest new theory that be first advance from logical grind the main example i can think of be from modern high-energy physic which be not typical of science a a whole mark a fulk university of rochester computer science department fulk
