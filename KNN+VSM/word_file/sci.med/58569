batch queue program available from variou source platform variou description any program that warn you of an upcoming appointment can be turn into an ad hoc rsi management tool or any batch queue submission program that let you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen using window a an example create a calendar file and include thi filename in ymy line so you get it on every startup of window suppose you want to have break every minute start from be pres special time to enter an appointment enter hit enter and type some text in say what the break be for then pres to set an alarm on thi entry and repeat for the next appointment by use window recorder you can record the keystroke that set up break throughout a day in a rec file put thi file on ymy line a above and you will then with a single keypres be able to set up ymy daily appointment with rsi exercise the above method should be adaptable to most calendar program an example use batch job would be to submit a simple job that run at be and warn you to take a break thi will depend a lot on ymy operate system while these approach be not ideal they be a good way of force yourself to take a break if you ca get hold of a suitable rsi management tool if you be techie enough you might want to write a version of typewatch see above for ymy operate system use batch job or whatever fit best tool digital watch with count-down timer available from variou source casio description many digital watch have timer that count down from a settable number of minute they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically while these be a very basic tool they be very useful if you be write read drive or do anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the great advantage be that they remind you to break from whatever you be do comment my own experience wa that cut down a lot on my type lead to my write a lot more and still read a much a ever which actually aggravate the rsi in my right arm though the leave arm improve getting a count-down timer watch ha be very useful on some occasion where i write a lot in a day i have try an old fashion hour-glas type egg timer but these be not much good because they do not give an audible warn of the end of the time period keyboard remapping tool these enable you to change ymy keyboard map so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout one-handed type tool may help but be very careful about how you use them if you keep the same overall type workload you be simply double ymy hand use for the hand that you use for type and may therefore make matter worse tool hsh public domain available from anonymou ftp platform unix do know which one description allows one-handed type and other general keyboard remapping only work through tty so you can use it with a terminal or an xterm but not most x program tool dvorak keyboard tool variou available from anonymou ftp also build into window description the dvorak keyboard apparently use a more rational layout that involf more balance hand use it may help prevent rsi a bite but you can also use it if you have rsi since it will slow down ymy type a lot dan wallach one of the most attractive feature of a connection dwallach machine be the array of blink light on the face office of it cabinet cm pari ref manual
