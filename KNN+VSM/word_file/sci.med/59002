from mmm mark robert thorson subject re barbecued food and health risk i do understand the assumption that because something be find to be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the i think that naturally occur substance exclude control substance be pretty much unregulated in term of their use a food food additive or other consumption it only when the chemist concoct sp an ingredient that it fall under fda regulation otherwise if they really look closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything how in the world do you suppose it legal to consume tobacco product which probably should be ban no there be something call the delany amendment which make carcinogenic food additive illegal in any amount thi wa pass by congres in the before stuff like ma spectrometry become available which increase detectable level of substance by a couple order of magnitude thi be why thing like cyclamate and red be ban they be very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantity in rat so under the act they be ban thi also apply to natural carcinogen some of you might remember a time back in the when root beer suddenly stop taste so good and never taste so good again that wa the time when safrole wa ban thi be the active flavor ingredient in sassafra leaf if it be possible to market a root beer good like the old day someone would do it in order to make money the fact that no one do it indicate that enforcement be still in effect an odd exception to the rule seem to be the product know a gumbo file thi be nothing more than coarsely grind dry sassafra leaf thi be not only a natural product but a natural product still in it natural form so maybe that how they evade delany or maybe a special exemption wa make to appease powerful louisiana democrat
