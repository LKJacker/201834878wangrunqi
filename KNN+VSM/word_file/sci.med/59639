from antonio franklin antonio subject re thermoscan ear thermometer in article ashwin ashwin ram write do the thermoscan instrument really work it be suppose to give you a fast and accurate temperature read in the ear how far in the ear do one have to insert the instrument is it worth the it be currently sell for no they do not work well my doctor start use one recently and i think the concept wa so amaze that i buy one too the thing work by read the infrared emission from the ear drum the ear drum be hotter than the ear canal wall so you have to point the thing very carefully thi mean tug on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal then insert the thing snugly then push a button unfortunately there be many thing that can go wrong it be almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself i get read which differ from each other by up to degree and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to degree i talk to one of the nurse in my doctor office recently about thi and she say she do like them either for same reason she do give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear and what correct insertion feel like but she say she think it wa impossible to do correctly on one self she also say that she and other nurse have complain to the company about inaccurate read and that someone from the company have tell them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time she demonstrate thi prior to read my temperature and manage to get a read within degree of the oral temperature i take at home before drive to the dr office i have also notice tha some nurse click the button then remove the probe immediately thi cause wrong read in my experience you have to leave the probe in a good to second after click the button to get a good measurement the nurse i talk with agree i suspect that many person do realize thi and therefore get bad read for yet another reason in short it a great idea it may work for some folk but i believe it do work well for a person who want to take hi own temperature
