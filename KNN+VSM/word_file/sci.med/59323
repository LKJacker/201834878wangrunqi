from banschbach subject pms-can it be prevented by a diet change thi question come up in scus med nutrition and i post my answer here only medical school in the teach course on human nutrition we have already see what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stone present themself to the medical community i think that the best example of where medicine be really miss the mark when it come to a knowledge of nutrition be pm so many woman and their husband suffer from thi disorder that it be really criminal that most physician in the be not teach that pm be primarily cause by diet and diet change can prevent it from ever happpening before shoot ymy flame read the entire article and then decide if flame be justify from a poster in scus medi nutrition in a psychological anthropology course i be take we get sidetrack onto a short conversation about pm some rumor share by several of the student include idea that vitamin level sugar intake and caffeine intake might affect pm symptom is there any datum on thi or be it just so much hooey many thank michael i want to reply to thi post ever since i saw it but i get side-tracked with candida pm be a lot like candida bloom most physician do recognize it a a specific disease entity here be everything that you would ever want to know about pm premenstrual syndrome ha be divide into fmy specific subgroup pmt-a anxiety pmt-d depression anxiety depression irritability forgetfulnes insomnium confusion depression lethargy pmt-c craving pmt-h hyperhydration crave for sweet weight gain increase appetite breast congestion and tendernes sugar ingestion cause abdominal bloat and tendernes headache edema of the face and extremity palpitation fatigue or faint pmt-a be characterize by elevate blood estrogen level and low progesterone level during the luteal phase of a woman cycle pmt-c be cause by the ingestion of large amount of refine simple carbohydrate during the luteal phase of a woman cycle there be increase glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge the metabolic find believe to be responsible for pmt-c be a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin thi condition of hypoglycemium be not unique to pm but there be a number of different cause of hypoglycemium magnesium and seem to be specific to pm hypoglycemium a am j psychiatry unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substitute for sugar magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation increase to of the total calory use safflower oil or even primrose oil a source of alpha linoleic acid pmt-d be characterize by elevate progesterone level during the midluteal phase of a woman cycle another cause of pmt-d ha be find to be lead toxicity in woman without elevate progesterone level during the midluteal phase effect of metal ion on the bind of estridol to human endometrial cystol fertil steril pmt-h be associate with water and salt retention along with an elevate serum aldosterone level salt restriction magnesium and vitamin e for breast tendernes have all be effective in treat pmt-h thi general discussion of the pm syndrome come form a management of the premenstrual tension sundrome rational for a nutritional approach a year in nutritional medicine j bland ed keat publishing b nutritional factor in the etiology of premenstrual tension syndrome j reprod c premenstrual tension prob obstet gynecol treatment ha traditionally involve progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for pm just about a hard a find one that will treat you for candida bloom while progesterone will work supplementation with vitamin and mineral work even better there really ha be an awful lot of research do on pm much more than candida bloom many of these study have be what be call experimental control study the type of rigorou clinical study that doctor like to see do here be a few of these study carbohydrate experimental controlled study effect of a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet on symptom of cyclical mastopathy lancet pt with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least year duration be randomly select to receive specific train to reduce dietary fat to of total calory and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or give general dietary advise with no train after month there wa a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swell and tendernes in the train group a report by self-reported symptom a well a physical exam which quantitated the degree of breast swell tendernes and nodularity vitamin a experimental controlled study the use of vitamin a in premenstrual tension actum obstet gynecol scand pt with severe recur pm receive to vitamin a daily or a placebo serum retinol level be monitor and high dose supplementation wa discontinue when evidence of toxicity occur serum retinol above the intent of the study wa to load the liver up with vitamin a and get a normal pool size to and then see if thi normal vitamin a pool could prevent pm get the high dose vitamin a have complete remission of the symptom of pm only get the placebo report get complete relief of pm sysmptom of the vitamin a treat group report no improvement in pm symptom experimental controlled study premenstrual tension treat with vitamin a j clinical endocrinology pt receive of vitamin a daily start on day of their cycle with supplementation continue until the onset of pm symptom after month all pt report a significant improvement in pm symptom vitamin a supplementation wa stop once evidence of toxicity wa demonstrate and all pt be follow for one year after high dose vitamin a supplementation wa stop pm symptom do not reoccur in any of these pt for upto one year after the vitamin a supplementation wa stop most american do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver these study and several other be design to see if get a normal store of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pm of all the vitamin give for pm vitamin a and vitamin e vitamin a ha show the best single effect thi be probably because vitamin a be involve in steroid metabolism in the liver getting ymy liver full of vitamin a seem to be one of the best thing that you can do to prevent the symptom of pm but vitamin a be toxic and you do want to be try to do thi without be see by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin a toxicity vitamin experimental double-blind crossoverr study pyridoxine vitamin and the premenstrual syndrome a randomize crossover trial coll gen pract woman age with moderate to severe pm randomly receive daily or placebo after month the group be switch and follow for another month have a significant effect on the emotional aspect of pm depression irritability and tirednes other symptom of pm be not significanttly affect by supplementation experimental double-blind study the efect of vitamin supplementation on premenstrual sysmptom obstet gynecol pt with moderate to severe pm receive daily or placebo for month analysi of convergence show that significantly improve premenstrual symptom relate to the autonomic nervou system dizzines and vomit a well a behavior change poor mental performance decrease social interaction anxiety depression and water retention be not improve by supplementation vitamin be below the rda for both american man and woman birth control pill and over different drug increase the requirement in man woman on birth control pill should be supplement with mg of per day the dose should be increase if symptom of pm appear dr david r rubinow who head the biological psychiatry branch of nimh wa quote in clin psychiatry news december a state that should be consider the first-line drug for pm over progesterone and if the patient do not respond then other treatment should be try vitamin can be toxic nerve damage if consume in dose of or more each day vitamin e experimental double-blind study efficacy of alpha tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome j reprod med pt receive vitamin e daily for cycle or a placebo vitamin e treat pt have who report a significant reduction in physical symptom weight gain and breast tendernes while the placebo group have who report a significant reduction in physical symptom the vitamin e group report that have a significant reduction in anxiety versu for the placebo group for depression the vitamin e group have with a significant decrease in depression compare with for the placebo group experimental double-blind study the effect of alpha-tocopherol on premenstrual symptomalogy a double blind study j am coll nutr with benign breast disease and pmt randomly receive vitamin e at or daily or placebo after month of supplementation of vitamin e or higher significantly improve pmt-a and pmt-c the dose wa need to significantly improve pmt-d no dose of vitamin e significantly improve pmt-h other study have show that a higher vitamin e dose will relieve pmt-h symptom magnesium experimental double-blind study magnesium prophylaxi of menstrual migraine effect on itracellular magnesium headache pt with perimenstrual headache receive mg daily of magnesium a magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a placebo treatment wa start on the day of the cycle and continue until menstruation after month the pain total index wa significantly lower in the magnesium group magnesium treatment wa also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the menstrual distres questionnaire score pretreatment magnesium level in lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear leukocyte be significantly lower in thi group of pt compare to control woman who do not suffer from pm after treatment magnesium level in these cell wa raise into the normal range experimental double-blind study oral magnesium successfully relieve premenstrual mood change obstet gynecol age randomly receive either magnesium carboxylic acid of mg per day or a placebo from the day of the cycle to the onset of the menstrual flow after cycle both group receive magnesium the menstrual distres questionnaire score of the cluster pain wa significantly reduce during the second cycle month for the magnesium treatment group a well a the placebo group once they be switch to magnesium supplementation in addition the total score on the menstrual distres questionnaire wa significantly decrease by magnesium supplementation the author suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood change that occur during pm there be numerou observational study that have be publish in the medical literature which also suggest that pm be primarily a disorder that arise out of a hormone imbalance that be dietary in nature but since observational study be consider by most physician in scus med to be anecdotal in nature i have not bother to cite them there be also over a half dozen good experimental study that have be do on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pm i choose the best specific study on individual vitamin and mineral to try to point out that pm be primarily a nutritional disorder but doctor do recognize nutritional disorder unles they can see clinical pathology beri-berus pellagra scruvy etc pm be probably the best reason why every doctor be train in the should get a good course on human nutrition pm be really only the tip if the iceberg when it come to nutritional disorder it time that medicine wake up and smell the rise here some study which show the importance in supplementation diet change in prevent pm experimental study effect of a nutritional programme on premenstrual syndrome a retrospective analysi complement med be give dietary instruction and supplement with optivite r plu additional vitamin c vitamin e magnesium zinc and primrose oil the dietary instruction be to take the supplement and switch to a low fat complex carbohydrate diet on a retrospective analysi of the report an improvement in their pm symptom with of the sample state that they no longer suffer from pm experimental double-blind study role of nutrition in manage premenstrual tension syndrome j reprod med a low fat high complex carbohydrate diet along with optivite supplementation significantly decrease pm score compare with diet change and placebo after month on the experimental program the supplementated group have significantly decrease estradiol and increase progesterone in serum during the midlutel phase of their cycle experimental double-blind study clinical and biochemical effect of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome j reprod med randomly give optivite tablet per day or a placebo the treat group show a significant decrease in pm symptom compare to the placebo another group of get optivite tablet per day or placebo for thi second group of patient no significant effect of supplementation on pm symptom wa observe martin banschbach professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine
