from mcelwre subject biological alchemy biological alchemy another form of cold fusion alternative heavy element creation in universe a very simple experiment can demonstrate prove the fact of biological transmutation reaction like mg o ca si c ca k h ca co etc a describe in the book biological transmutation by loui kervran edition be best and in chapter of the book the secret life of plant by peter tompkin and christopher bird obtain a good sample of plant seed all of the same kind some kind might work better that other divide the sample into two group of equal weight and number sprout one group in distil water on filter paper for three or fmy week separately incinerate both group weigh the residue from each group the residue of the sprout group will usually weigh at least several percent more than the other group analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for mineral content some of the mineral atom of the sprout group have be transmuted into heavier mineral element by fusing with atom of oxygen hydrogen carbon nitrogen etc biological transmutation occur routinely even in my own body ingesting a source of organic silicon silicon with carbon such a horsetail extract or radish can speed healing of broken bone vium the reaction si c ca much faster than by merely ingest the calcium directly some mineral deposit in the grind be form by micro organism fusing together atom of silicon carbon nitrogen oxygen hydrogen etc the two reaction si c ca by micro-organism cause stone sicknes in statue build brick etc the reaction co catalyse by very hot iron create a carbon-monoxide poison hazard for welder operator and person near woodstove even properly seal one some bacterium can even neutralize radioactivity all of these thing and more happen in spite of the currently accept law of physic include the law which say that atomic fusion require extremely high temperature and pressure biological transmutation and their application in chemistry physic biology ecology medicine nutrition agrigulture geology edition by c loui kervran active member of new york academy of science page illustrated swan house publishing co box binghamton ny the secret life of plant by peter tompkin and christopher bird page harper row new york chapter and be about radionic entire book be fascinating for more information answer to ymy question etc please consult my cited source the two book un-altered reproduction and dissemination of thi important information be encouraged robert e mcelwaine physic and astronomy uw-ec
