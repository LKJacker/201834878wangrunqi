from mmm mark robert thorson subject re barbecued food and health risk thi remind me of the last graham kerr cook show i saw today he smoke meat on the stovetop in a big pot he use a strange technique i never see before he take a big pot with lid and place a tray in it make from aluminum foil the tray wa about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray make by crumple a sheet of foil around the edge in the tray he place a couple spoonful of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice he say any rice will do the content of two teabag of earl grey tea and a few cleave on top of thi wa place an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer with two chicken breast in it the lid wa put on and the whole assembly go on the stovetop at high heat for or minute later he remove what look like smoke chicken breast what surprise and concern me be no wood chip where do the smoke flavor come from about or year ago i remember hear that carmel color obtain by caramelize sugar a common color and flavor agent have be find to be carcinogenic i believe they inject it under the skin of rat or something if the result be conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the yet it be still be use wa the initial research result find to be incorrect or what about or year ago i remember earl grey tea be implicate a carcinogenic because it contain oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citru fruit do anyone know whatever happen with that story if it be carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it a an additive yet it apparently continue to do so wrt natural wood smoke i smoke a duck right now a it happen i notice that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eat directly out of the smoker if the smoke ha only recently stop flow i find the best taste to be have by use dry wood chip get lot of smoke right up at the begin of the cook proces then slowly barbeque for hour and hour without add additional wood chip my theory be that the unpleasant tangy molecule be low-molecular weight stuff like terpenis and that the smoky flavor molecule be some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drife off the low-molecular weight stuff just leave the flavor behind do anyone know if my theory be correct i also remember hear that the combustion product of fat drip on the charcoal and burn be carcinogenic for that reason and because it cover the product with soot and some unpleasant tangines i only grill non-drippy meat like prawn directly over hot coal i do stuff like thi duck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coal at one end and the meat at the other end the fat drop directly on the floor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coal and yet another reason i hear not to smoke or barbeque meat be that smoke cure meat like pork sausage and bacon contain nitrosamine which be carcinogenic i pretty sure thi claim actually ha some stand do know about the other an amuse incident i recall wa the duncan hine scandal when it wa discover that the person who make duncan hine cake mix be put a lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppres weevil thi be a fumigant which be know to be carcinogenic the guy who represent the company in the pres conference defend himself by say that the risk from eat duncan hine product every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eat two charcoal broil steak what a great analogy when i first hear that my immediate reaction wa we should make that a standard unit one charcoal broil steak would be equivalent to duncan
