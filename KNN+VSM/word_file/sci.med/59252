from robert e schmieg subject re quack-quack wa re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction ken write i do know the first thing about yeast infection but i be a scientist no scientist would take ymy statement no convince empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome to tell you anything except an absence of datum on the question the burden of proof rest upon those who claim the existence of thi syndrome to date these claim be unsubstantiated by any available datum hopefully a a scientist you would take issue with anyone overstate their conclusion base upon their datum beasty with present method even if they be there noring and the fellow from oklahoma sorry forget ymy name have also suggest one set of anecdotal evidence in favor base on their personal experience namely that when person with certain condition be give anti-fungal many of them appear to get better gee i have many interest and enlighten anecdote about myself my friend and my family but in the practice of medicine i expect and demand more rigorou rationale for base therapy than aunt susie brother-in-law anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesi but rarely prove anything in a positive sense and unlike mathematics boolean logic rarely apply directly to medical issue and so evidence of do not usually disprove but rather modify current concept of disease so if you have any evidence against the hypothesi for example control double-blind study show that the anti-fungal do do any better than sugar water then let hear it if you do then what we have be anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject disbelief on the other in which case please there be no point in yell back and forth at each other any longer since neither side ha any convince evidence either positive or negative i would characterize it not a disbelief but rather outrage over vastly overstate conclusion it appear to me the main question now be whether the proponent can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convince and document enough manner to make a good case for carry out a good control double-blind study of antifungal or else forget convince anybody else to carry out the test just carry it out themself and also whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptom on which such a study should be carry out to provide a fair test of the hypothesi i have no problem with such an approach but thi be not what be happen in the of thi diagnosi bob schmieg
