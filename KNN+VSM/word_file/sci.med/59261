from vrao vinay rao subject perception of doctor and health care the follow article by columnist mike royko be hi humorou commentary on some of the public perception of doctor and their salary i hope some of you will find it a amuse a i do reprinted permission there no cure for stupidity of poll on doctor salary by mike royko tribune medium service on a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctor earn be right up there it almost score a perfect brain-dead it wa commission by some whiny consumer group call family usa the poll tell u that the majority of american believe that doctor make too much money the pollster also ask what a fair income would be for physician those poll say oh about a year would be ok how generou how sport how stupid why be thi poll stupid because it be base on resentment and envy two emotion that run hot during the political campaign and be still simmer you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earn and get the same result since the majority of american do make those buck they assume that those who do be steal it from them maybe the berlin wall come down but do kid yourself karl marx life it also stupid because it do ask key question such a do you know how much education and train it take to become a physician if those poll say no they do know then they should have be disqualify if they give the wrong answer they should have be drop what good be their view on how much a doctor should earn if they do know what it take to become a doctor or maybe a question should have be phrase thi way how much should a person earn if he or she must a get excellent grade and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to b be accept by a good college and spend fmy year take course heavy in math physic chemistry and other lab work and maintain a average or better and c spend fmy more year of grind study in medical school with the third and fourth year in clinical train work to hour a week and d spend another year a a low-pay hard-work intern and e put in another three to year of post-graduate train depend on ymy specialty and f maybe wind up in debt after medical school and g then work an average of hour a week with many family doctor put in hour or more until they retire or fall over a you have probably guess by now i have considerably more respect for doctor than do the law firm of clinton and clinton and all the lawyer and insurance executive they have call together to remake america health care based on what doctor contribute to society they be far more useful than the power-happy ego-tripping program-spewing social tinkerer who will probably give u a medical plan that be to health what clinton first budget be to frugality but propaganda work and a the stupid poll indicate many american wrongly believe that profiteer doctor be the major cause of high medical cost of course doctor be well-compensated they should be american now live longer than ever but who be responsible for my longevity lawyer congres or the guy flip burger in a mcdonald and the doctor prolong my life despite my have become a nation of self-indulgent lard-butted tv-gaping couch cabbage ah that be not something you hear president clinton or super spouse talk about during the campaign or since but instead of try to turn the medical profession into a villain they might have be more honest if they have say let u talk about medical care and one of the biggest problem we have that problem be you my fellow american ye you eat too much and eat the wrong food many of you guzzle too much hooch still
