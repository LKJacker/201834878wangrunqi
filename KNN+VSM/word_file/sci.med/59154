sequence datum weis cohen n indurkhya tutorial program tutorial will be conduct at the bethesda ramada hotel on tuesday july introduction to molecular biology for computer scientist prof mick noordewier rutger university thi overview of the essential fact of molecular biology be intend a an introduction to the field for computer scientist who wish to apply their tool to thi rich and complex domain material cover will include structural and informational molecule the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and select other topic in the area of structure function and regulation a relate to current computational approach dr noordewier ha appointment in both computer science and biology at rutger and ha extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to hi current work in computational biology introduction to artificial intelligence for biologist dr richard lathrop mit arri corp an overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be present a it relate to actual and potential biological application fundamental technique symbolic program language and notion of search will be discuss a well a select topic in somewhat greater detail such a knowledge representation inference and machine learn the intend audience include biologist with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence dr lathrop co-developer of ariadne and relate technology ha work in the area of artificial intelligence apply to biological problem in both academium and industry neural network statistic and information theory in biological sequence analysi dr alan lapede lo alamo national laboratory thi tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of intelligent system for molecular biology that of machine learn technique apply to sequence analysi closely interrelate topic to be address include the use of artifical neural network to elicit both specific signal and general characteristic of sequence and the relationship of such approach to statistical technique and information-theoretic view of sequence datum dr lapede of the theoretical division at lo alamo ha long be a leader in the use of such technique in thi domain genetic algorithm and genetic programming prof john koza stanford university the genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problem wa originally inspire by a biological metaphor thi tutorial will cover both the biological motivation and the actual implementation and characteristic of the algorithm genetic programming an extension well-suited to problem where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution be a major part of the problem will also be address particular attention will be pay to biological application and to identify resource and software that will permit attendee to begin use the method dr koza a consulting professor of computer science at stanford ha teach thi subject since and be the author of a standard text in the field linguistic method in sequence analysi prof david searl university of pennsylvanium shmuel pietrokovski weizmann institute approach to sequence analysi base on linguistic methodology be increasingly in evidence these involve the adaptation of tool and technique from computational linguistic for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structure and phenomenon use formal language theory the identification of significant vocabulary and overlap code in sequence datum and sequence comparison reflect taxonomic and functional relatednes dr searl who hold research faculty appointment in both genetic and computer science at penn represent the branch of thi field that consider higher-order syntactic approach to sequence datum while shmuel pietrokovski ha study and publish with prof edward trifinov in the area of word-based analysis registration form mail with check
