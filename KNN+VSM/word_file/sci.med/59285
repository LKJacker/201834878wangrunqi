from david david dodell subject medical news part cut here call for employer to keep information about the hiv statu of health-care worker confidential but doctor who know of an hiv-positive colleague who ha not seek advice must inform the employ authority and the appropriate professional regulatory body the guideline also emphasize the significance of notify all patient on whom an invasive procedure ha be do by an infect health-care worker a model letter to patient who have come into contact with such an individual be provide along with suggestion for health official on how to deal with the medium in addition a advisory panel on hiv infection in health-care worker ha be form to provide specific occupational recommendation to those treat such patient property of an hiv nature vol no p volvovitz franklin and smith gale the question raise by moore et al about recombinant envelope glycoprotein precursor from produce by microgenesy be advantage rather than disadvantage write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesy in meriden conn moore et al say that in a baculoviru expression system do not bind strongly to the receptor and that thi recombinant do not stimulate the same antibody a the viru do in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant in patient infect with broaden specific envelope-directed immune response include crossreactive antibody to epitope and and cytotoxic t-cell response volvovitz and smith claim that they never intend their molecule to be identical to the native protein antibody response against native protein include the type describe by moore et al exist in nearly all aid patient but do not prevent hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april progression of hiv disease in addition the bind of or antibody complex to ha be show to interfere with antigen specific activation of cell and trigger program cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesi of hiv infection the absence of bind by the microgenesy vaccine may therefore be view a an add safety feature phase i study have demonstrate stable count stimulation of cytotoxic t cell and the suggestion of restoration of immune function based on these and other clinical result microgenesy wa choose by researcher at the karolinska institute in sweden for the first phase iius vaccine therapy study conclude volvovitz and smith infection breast milk and

infection wa report in five of the patient include fmy who have clear evidence of risk factor for the disease one patient who have only a single evaluation by the dentist deny high-risk behavior comparative dna sequence analysi show that the viruse from the dentist and these five patient be not closely relate the study suggest the potential for hiv transmission from a general dentist to hi patient be minimal in a set in which universal precaution be strictly observe conclude dickinson et al april aid patient be susceptible to recurrence of tb study say washington post p tuberculosi can strike aid patient more than once which make the resurge health hazard harder to control accord to a study publish in today new england journal of medicine person who contract tb usually develop an immunity that protect them if they be expose to the bacterium again but a person whose immune system be deplete may not be able to fight off a new tb infection doctor find peter m small of the howard

lancet march issue schechter et al call duesberg hypothesi that inject and orally use recreational drug and azt lead to aid a hindrance to public health initiative however their hypothesi that hiv be the cause of aid ha not attain any public health benefit the government spend billion annually but no vaccine no therapy no prevention and no aid control have result from work on thi hypothesi schechter et al conclude that hiv ha a key role in depletion and aid base on epidemiological correlation with antibody against hiv and with self report recreational drug use among homosexual from vancouver however their survey neglect to disprove duesberg drug aid hypothesi because it do not provide control confirm drug free aid case and because it do not quantify drug use and ignore azt use altogether to refute duesberg hypothesi schechter would have to produce a control study demonstrate that over a period of up to year hiv-positive patient who use recreational drug or azt or both have the same aid risk a positive who do not do so the year period be claim by hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april proponent of the hiv hypothesi to be the time need for hiv to cause aid

reichman professor of medicine at the university of new jersey medical school and president of the american lung association say right now it a big city problem but potentially it everyone problem the ala predict that million american be infect with tb and about percent of them will develop the disease because their immune system be depress especially those with aid or hiv gene hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april tamme a center for disease control expert say that be why the cdc ha issue guideline warn hospital and institution not to mix aid with tb patient state health official believe the tb be also spread because those who be most susceptible be the least likely to follow through with treatment in addition the increase be attribute to a shortage of public health service in new york city tb be an epidemic because the number of case be increase faster than we can treat person say dr george diferdinando director of the new york state tb control according to diferdinando curb the spread of tb entail keep percent or more of diagnose tb case in treatment about percent of infect new york city resident do complete therapy when tb patient do finish take their

partially relate to misclassification of risk write okey c nwanyanwu et al of the center for disease control in atlantum ga the researcher investigate such aid case from broward and coastal palm beach county all of these case attribute to heterosexual transmission report sexual contact with bisexual man inject drug user or person bear in country where heterosexual contact be the primary route of hiv transmission medical record of patient in addition to record from social service hiv counsel and test center and sexually transmit disease std clinic be review if no other hiv risk factor wa find from medical record review patient be interview use a standardize questionnaire once std clinic and other medical record be review man and woman be reclassify into other hiv transmission category after adjustment be make for the reclassification the percentage of aid case report from palm beach and broward county between january and march that wa attribute to heterosexual transmission decrease from percent to percent among man and from percent to percent among woman while the percentage of heterosexually transmit aid case in southern florida decrease after adjustment wa make for reclassify
