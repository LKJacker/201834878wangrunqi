from banschbach subject re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article elisabeth s davidson write in a previou article banschbach say least a few enlighten physician practice in the it really too bad that most medical school do cover nutrition because if they do candida would not be view a a non-disease by so many in the medical profession case western reserve med school teach nutrition in it own section a well a cover it in other section a they apply deficiency in neuro a a cause of neuropathy deficiency in hematology a a cause of megaloblastic anemium yet i sill hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine candida can cause mucocutaneou candidiasi and in already very sick patient with damage immune system like aid and cancer patient systemic candida infection i think the yeast connection be a bunch of hooey what do thi have to do with how well nutrition be teach anyway elisabeth let set the record straight for the nth time i have not read the yeast connection so anything that i say be not due to brainwash by thi hat book it okay i gues to hate the book by why hate me elisabeth i go to quote from zinsser microbiology edition a book that you should be familiar with and not hate candida specie colonize the mucosal surface of all human during birth or shortly thereafter the risk of endogenou infection be clearly ever present indeed candidiasi occur worldwide and be the most common systemic mycosi neutrophil play the main role in prevent a systemic infection candidiasi so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or sick neutrophil to see a systemic infection poor diet and persistent parasitic infestation set many third world resident up for candidiasi ymy assessment of candidiasi in the be correct and i do not dispute it what i post wa a discussion of candida bloom without systemic infection these bloom would be responsible for local site of irritation gi tract mouth vagina and sinu cavity knocking down the bacterial competition for candida wa propose a a possible trigger for candida bloom let me quote from zinsser again however some factor such a the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic may predispose to both mucosal and systemic infection i wa address mucosal infection i like the term bloom better the nutrition course that i teach cover thi effect of antibiotic treatment a well a the cure i gues that ymy nutrition course do not too bad here be a brief primer on yeast yeast infection a they be commonly call be not truely cause by yeast the most common organism responsible for thi type of infection be candida albican or monilium which be actually a yeast-like fungu well maybe i get picky but i alway think that a yeast wa one form that a fungu could exist in the other be the mold form many fungi can occur a either yeast or mold depend on environment candida exibit what be know a reverse dimorphism it exist a a mold in the tissue but exist a a yeast in the environment should we maybe call it a mold infection a fungu infection maybe we should say it be cause by a mold-like fungu martin banschbach professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine west st tulsa ok you the chairman of biochem and micro and you do know that a yeast be a form of a fungu shudder or maybe you do know and be oversimplify my my elisabeth do i detect a little of steve dyer in you if you notice my faculty rank i a biochemist not a microbiologist candida be classifed a a fungu accord to zinsser but a you point out it display dimorphism it be capable of produce yeast cell pseudohypha and true hypha elisabeth you be probably a microbiologist and that make a lot of sense to you to a biochemist it a lot of greek so i call it a yeast-like fungu go ahead and crucify me you know elisabeth i still have be able to figure out why such a small little organism like candida can bring out so much hostility in person in scus med and i must admitt that i get suck into the mud sling too i keep hop that if person will just take the time to think about what i say that it will make sense i not ask anyone here to buy into the yeast connection book because i do know what in that book plain and simple and to be honest with you i begin to wish that it wa never write marty b
