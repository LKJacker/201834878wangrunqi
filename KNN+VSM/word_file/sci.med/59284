article research show promise for preventing or slowing blindnes due to retinal disease national retinitis pigmentosa foundation neutrophilic factor rescue photoreceptor cell in animal test baltimore md researcher at the university of californium san francisco and regeneron pharmaceutical inc nasdaq regn have discover that certain naturally occur substance know a neurotrophic factor can prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cell in the retina of the eye the degeneration of these cell know a photoreceptor be a major cause of visual impairment thi research publish to in the december issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science pna hold promise for person who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exist it be estimate that million american have severe vision los due to age-related macular degeneration and american be affect by retinitis pigmentosu a hereditary disease that cause blindnes in addition each year more than person undergo surgical procedure to repair retinal detachment and other retinal trauma the research wa fund in part by the rp retinitis pigmentosa foundation fighting blindnes regeneron pharmaceutical and the national eye institute it wa conduct by dr matthew m lavail kazuhiko unoki dougla yasurnura michael t matthe and roy h steinberg at ucsf arld dr c eorge yancoooulo regeneron vice president for discovery regeneron hold an exclusive license for thi research from ucsf in the research describe in the pna a light-damage model wa use to ass the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occur substance experimental rat be expose to constant light for one week eye that have not be treat with an effective factor lose most of their photoreceptor cell the rod and cone of the retina after light exposure brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf be particularly effective in thi model without cause unwanted side effect other factor such a nerve growth factor ngf and insulin-like growth factor be not effective in these experiment discussing the research dr jesse m cedarbaum regeneron director of clinical research say bdnf ability to rescue neuron in the retina that have be damage by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age relate macular degeneration one of the lead cause of vision impairment and for retinal detachment following detachment permanent vision los may hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april result frorn the death of detach retinal cell it be possible that bdnf could play a role in rescue those cell once the retina ha be reattached surgically retinitis pigmentosa be a slowly progress disease that cause the retina to degenerate over a period of year or even decade vision decrease to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindnes it be my hope that research on growth factor will provide a mean to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life state jeanette s felix director of science for the rp foundation fighting blindnes in addition to the work describe regeneron be develop bdnf in conjunction with aingen inc nasdaq amgn a a possible treatment for peripheral neuropathy associate with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy motor neuron disease parkinson disease and alzheimer disease by itself regeneron be test cntf in patient with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosi commonly know a lou gehrig disease regeneron pharlnaceutical inc base in tarrytown new york be a leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compound for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease peripheral neuropathy and nerve injury which affect more than seven million american dr lavail and steinberg of ucsf be consultant to regeneron hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april affluent diet increase risk of heart disease research resource reporter write by mary weideman national institute of health high-fat high-calorie diet rapidly increase risk factor for coronary heart disease in native population of develop country that have traditionally consume diet low in fat these find accord to investigator at the oregon health science university in portland have seriou implication for public health in both industrialize and develop country thi study demonstrate why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride level it show also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby lead to a whole host of other health problem in develop country and affluent nation a well explain principal investigator dr william e connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at oregon health science university over the past year dr connor and hi team have characterize the food and nutrient intake of the tara humara indian in mexico while simultaneously document variou aspect of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexican number approximately and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountain in the state of chihuahua the tarahumara have couple an agrarian diet to endurance race probably a a result coronary heart disease which be so prevalent in western industrialize nation be virtually non existent in their culture loosely translate the name tarahumara mean fleet of foot reflect a tribal passion for bet on kickball race in which participant run distance of mile or more while kick a machete-carved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consist primarily of pinto bean tortilla and pinole a drink make of grind roast corn mix with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruit and vegetable the tara humara also eat small amount of game fish and egg their food contain approximately percent of total calory a fat of which the majority percent be of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigator in the study describe their diet a simple and very rich in nutrient while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumara have average plasma cholesterol level of mg dl low-density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol level of and high-density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol level of to all of those value be in the good low-risk range accord to the researcher elevated cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol level be consider risk factor for heart hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april disease hdl-cholesterol be consider beneficial in previou study the tarahumara have be find to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to high-cholesterol diet with elevation in total and ldl cholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator marium teresa cerqueira establish a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school build near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi food wa weigh cook and feed to the study participant under the investigator direct supervision ensure that subject eat only food stipulate by the research protocol fasting blood wa draw twice weekly and plasma sample be freeze and ship to dr connor laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analysis regular measurement include participant body weight height and tricep skin fold thicknes thirteen tarahumara five woman and eight man include one adolescent be feed their native diet for week follow by week of an affluent diet in thi study we go up to a concentration of dietary fat that wa percent of total calory thi be the prototype of the holiday diet that many american consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborate dr conner such dietary characteristic be reflect in the cholesterol-saturation index or csi recently devise research dietitian sonja conner work with dr connor the csi be a single number that incorporate both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturate fat in the diet csi indicate the diet potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl dr connor explain the tarahumaran diet average a very low csi of dr connor affluent diet use in the study rank a csi of the experimental design of thi study reflect the importance of establish baseline plasma lipid level typical of the native diet before expose subject to the experimental diet the standard curve relate dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrate a level off or plateau for consumption of large amount of fat change in dietary fat cholesterol in thi range have little effect on plasma level you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variable you be go to put into the experimental diet the framingham study for example do not discriminate on the basi of diet between individual who get heart disease because the diet wa already high in fat all subject be already eat on a plateau dr connor say after week of consume the affluent diet the subject mean plasma cholesterol level have in crease by percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rise percent hdl-cholesterol increase by per cent and ldl to hdl ratio change therefore very little plasma triglyceride level increase by percent and subject average an gain in weight according to dr connor lipid change occur surprisingly soon yield nearly the same result after day of affluent diet a after day hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the increase in hdl carry broad dietary implication for industrialize nation we think hdl-cholesterol increase because we increase the amount of dietary fat over the fat content use in the previou tarahumara metabolic study in that study we saw no change in hdl level after raise the dietary cholesterol but keep the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increase fat intake to percent of the total calory we reach the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflect the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increase quite a bite in thi study dr connor explain low hdl in the tarahumaran be not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amount of fat or cholesterol hdl remain an important predictor to american because of their usual high fat intake dr connor recommend a diet for american that contain le than percent of total calory a fat le than mg of cholesterol and a csi around vary in accordance with caloric need such a diet be low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comment on recent suggestion that american adopt a mediterranean-style diet the original mediterranean diet in it pristine state consist of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy product we be already eat a lot of meat and dairy product simply to continue that pattern while switch to olive oil be not go to help the situation the world health organization who be focus much attention on the emergence of disease such a coronary heart disease in nation and society undergo technological development dr connor say that coronary heart disease start with a give society elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increase the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which place a termendou health care burden on a society who would like the develop country to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspect of their economic development and on public health measure to improve general well-being rather than pay for unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connor say the overall implication of thi study be that human can readily move their plasma lipid and lipoprotein value into a high-risk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united state be percent le than it wa year ago so a lot ha be accomplish we be change rapidly he conclude
