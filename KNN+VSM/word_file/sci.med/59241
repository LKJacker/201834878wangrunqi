from ken ken miller subject re quack-quack wa re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article rind david rind write in article noring jon noring write may i suggest seriously that if the doctor and wanna-be-doctor on the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatment and theory such a the yeast theory should create ymy own moderate group why is there some reason why you feel that it should be point out in that there be no convince empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome i do know the first thing about yeast infection but i be a scientist no scientist would take ymy statement no convince empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome to tell you anything except an absence of datum on the question noring ha point out the that if the crazy theory be true you probably could find any direct evidence of it that you could observe those yeastie beasty with present method even if they be there noring and the fellow from oklahoma sorry forget ymy name have also suggest one set of anecdotal evidence in favor base on their personal experience namely that when person with certain condition be give anti-fungal many of them appear to get better so if you have any evidence against the hypothesi for example control double-blind study show that the anti-fungal do do any better than sugar water then let hear it if you do then what we have be anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject disbelief on the other in which case please there be no point in yell back and forth at each other any longer since neither side ha any convince evidence either positive or negative and i understand that ymy abject disbelief be base on the existence of person who may get famou or make money apply the diagnosi to everything in sight make wild claim with no evidence and alway refuse to do control study but that ha absolutely no bear on the apparently sincere experience of the person on the net observe anti-fungal work on themself and other person in certain specific case there be also quack who sell oral superoxide dismutase in spite of the fact that it completely break down in the gut but thi do change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fight oxidative damage same thing just cause there be candida quack that do establish evidence against the candida hypothesi if there some other reason beside the quack if only anecdotal to think it could be true then that be what ha to be consider that be what the net person have be talk about but again there be no point in argue about it there be anecdotal evidence and there be no convince evidence and there be also some candida quack out there i hope everyone can agree on all of that thu it appear to me the main question now be whether the proponent can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convince and document enough manner to make a good case for carry out a good control double-blind study of antifungal or else forget convince anybody else to carry out the test just carry it out themself and also whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptom on which such a study should be carry out to provide a fair test of the hypothesi ken
