from banschbach subject re chromium a dietary suppliment for weight los in article henry melton write my wife ha request that i poll the sage of usenet to see what be know about the use of chromium in weight-control diet suppliment she ha see multiple product advertise it and would like any kind real information my first impulse wa yuck a metal but i have zero datum on it what do you know henry melton i tell you all that i know about chromium but before i do i want to get a few thing off my chest i just get blast in e-mail for my kidney stone post kidney stone be primarily cause by diet a be heart disease and cancer when i give dietary advise it be not intend to encourage person read thi news group or scus med nutrition where i do most of my post to avoid see a doctor nothing can be further from the truth kidney stone can be cause by tumor and thi possibility ha to be rule out but once it be diet be a good way of prevent a reoccurance same thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these disease do use what i go to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid go to a doctor you have to go hopefully you will find a doctor who know enough about nutrition to help you change ymy risk factor for both disease a part of a treatment program but the odd be that you will not and that why i here when my wife detect a lump in here breast i do say do worry my vitamin e will take care of it any breast lump ha to be work up by a physician plan and simple if it begnin which most be fine then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lump from occur but let me tell you right now if you have try diet and supplementation and another lump return get ymy butt into the doctor office a fast a ymy little foot can carry you better yet have a mammography do on a regular basi my wife keep put her off both myself and her gynocologist tell her she need to have one do her gynocologist even schedule one but she do show up too busy run the operating room for the biggest hospital in tulsa one more thing i be not an orthomolecular nutritionist thi group use high dose vitamin and mineral to treat all kind of disease there be absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamin and mineral can and do have drug action in the body but you talk about fly blind man thi be really blind treatment no drug could ever be use a these vitamin and mineral be be use i not say that some of thi stuff could be right on the money it may well be but my approach to nutrition be a lot like that of weinsier and morgan the two who write the new clinical nutrition textbook my push be the nutrient reserve and the lab test need to measure these reserve and then supplementation or diet change to get these reserve build up to where they should be to let you handle stres that where i come from folk blast away if you want i not go to change put me in ymy killfile if you want i really do care i average e-mail message a day from person who think that i get something important to say but i also get hit by a few with an axe to grind that life chromium be one of the trace element it ha a very limit but very important role in the body it be use to form glucose tolerance factor gtf gtf be make up of chromium nicinamide niacin glycine cysteine and glutamic only the chromium and the niacin be need from the diet to form gtf some food already have gtf liver brewer or nutritional yeast and black pepper when chromium be in gtf a pretty good absorption be see about but when it be simply present a a mineral or mineral chelate chromium picolinate it absorption be much lower to lowest for all the mineral i be post in misc fitnes and chromium ha come up there several time a a fat burner chromium be among the least toxic of the mineral so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm i would do it though the adequate and safe range for chromium be to per day the average american be get about per day from diet chromium level decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes be primarily a chromium deficiency i can cite you several study that have be do with glucose tolerance in type ius diabetes but i not go to because for each positive one there also seem to be a negative one a well i convince that the problem be bioavailability when yeast gtf be use good result be obtain but when chromium itself be use the result be usually negative in addition to type ius diabetes chromiuum ha be examine in cardiovascular disease and glucoma again with mix result a far a cardiovascular disease be concern since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease thi possible link with chromium be too surprise glucoma be a little more interest muscle eye focus activity be primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function if thi eye focus activity be impair by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocular pressure be believe to be elevate in a fairly large study of pt with glaucoma the one consistent find wa a low rbc chromium j am coll nutr but thi one preliminary study should not prompt person to go out and start pop chromium supplement for one thing just about every older person be go to have a low rbc chromium unles they have be take chromium suppleemnt yeast since glucoma be often find in older person it not too surprise that chromium wa low in the rbc if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would prompt some attention i suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out thi possible chromium link to glucoma you could find out what ymy body chromium pool size wa by either the rbc chromium test or hair analysi most clinical lab be not go to run a rbc chromium there be plenty of lab that will do a hair and nail analysi for you but i would use them there be just too much funny busines go on in these unregulated lab right now here weinsier and morgan advise on chromium they do not consider chromium to be one of those mineral for which a reliable clinical test be available they do like the hair and nail analysi lab either and they also recognize the rbc chromium be primarily a research test that be not routinely available in most clinical chemistry lab thi ha to change and a more lab run a rbc chromiuum it will what then do they suggest make a diagnosi of chromium deficiency base on a document clinical response to chromium run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation once you make the diagnosi put the patient on of orally each day or of yeast per day what my advise do take chromium supplement to try to loose weight they just do not work that way if you want to take them and then exercise that would be great do include yeast a part of ymy diet most american be not get enough chromium from their diet if you do have a poor glucose tolerance ask ymy doctor to check ymy chromium statu when he or she say what in the world be you talk about just say please get a copy of weinsier and morgan new clinical nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patient who present with a poor glucose tolerance if you ca do that i find a doctor who can thank you very much marty b
