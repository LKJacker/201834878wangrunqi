from cerulean bill christens-barry subject cytoskeleton dynamic i look for good background and review paper reference that can help me understand the dynamic of cytoskeleton in normal and transform cell in particular i not interest in translational behavior and cell motility but rather in the internal motion of the cytoskeleton and it component under normal and transform circumstance also i appreciate any datum on force constant mechanical and elastic property of microtubule and viscou property of cytoplasm any other info relevant to the vibrational or acoustical property of these would be useful to me thank bill christens-barry cerulean
