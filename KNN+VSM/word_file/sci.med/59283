mmwr date apr cesarean delivery have account for nearly million of the approximately million annual delivery in the united state since table the cesarean rate in the united state be the third highest among report country exceed only by brazil and puerto rico thi report present datum on cesarean delivery from cdc national hospital discharge survey nhd for and compare these datum with previou year datum on discharge from short-stay nonfederal hospital have be collect annually since in the nhd conduct by cdc national center for health statistic for medical and demographic information be abstract from a sample of inpatient discharge from participate hospital the cesarean and vaginal birth after a prior cesarean vbac present in thi report be base on weight national estimate from the nhd sample of approximately woman discharge after delivery the estimate number of live birth by type of delivery be calculate by apply cesarean rate from the nhd to live birth from national vital registration datum therefore estimate of the number of cesarean in thi report will not agree with previously publish datum base solely on the nhd stated difference in thi analysi be significant at the confidence level base on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value of in there be cesarean per delivery the same rate a in and similar to rate during table the primary cesarean rate number of first cesarean per delivery to woman who have no previou cesarean for also wa stable range from to in the cesarean rate in the south wa significantly p higher than the rate for the west midwest and northeast rate be higher for mother age greater than or equal to year than for younger woman in proprietary hospital than in nonprofit or government hospital in hospital with fewer than bed than in larger hospital and for delivery for which blue shield and other private insurance be the expect source of payment than for other source of payment table the same pattern characterize primary cesarean delivery since the early the number and percentage of birth to older woman increase however if the age distribution of mother in have remain the same a in the overall cesarean rate in would have be essentially the same a the observe based on the nhd of the approximately live birth in an hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april estimate be by cesarean delivery of these an estimate birth be repeat cesarean and be primary cesarean since approximately primary cesarean have be perform annually in of woman who have a previou cesarean deliver vaginally compare with in of all cesarean in be associate with a previou cesarean with dystocium failure of labor to progress with breech presentation with fetal distres and with all other specify complication the average hospital stay for all delivery in wa day in comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery wa day and for a repeat cesarean day nearly twice the duration for vbac delivery day or for vaginal delivery that be not vbac day in the average hospital stay for all delivery wa day for primary cesarean day for repeat cesarean day and for vbac and non-vbac vaginal delivery and day respectively reported by office of vital and health statistic system national center for health statistic cdc editorial note the cesarean rate in the united state steadily increase from through however the find in thi report indicate that rate have be stable since because there be little evidence that maternal and child health statu ha improve during thi time and because cesarean be associate with an increase risk for complication of childbirth a national health objective for the year be to reduce the overall cesarean rate to or fewer per delivery and the primary cesarean rate to or fewer per delivery objective postpartum complication include urinary tract and wind infection may account in part for the longer hospital stay for cesarean delivery than for vaginal birth moreover the prolong hospital stay for cesarean delivery substantially increase health-care cost for example in the average cost for cesarean and vaginal delivery be and respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery include for physician fee and for hospital charge if the cesarean rate in have be the year objective instead of the number of cesarean birth would have decrease by versu result in a save of more than billion in physician fee and hospital charge despite the steady increase in vbac rate since several factor may impede progress toward the year national health objective for cesarean delivery for example vbac rate substantially reflect the number of woman offer trial of labor which ha be increasingly encourage since of woman who be offer a trial of labor could deliver vaginally a level already achieve by many hospital trial of labor wa routinely offer in of hospital survey in the most recent year for which hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national datum be available when the vbac rate accord to nhd datum wa the year objective specify a vbac rate of base on all woman who have a prior cesarean regardles of whether a trial of labor wa attempt to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increase in the vbac rate will need to be combine with a substantial reduction in the primary rate one hospital succeed in reduce the rate of cesarean delivery by apply objective criterium for the fmy most common indication for cesarean delivery by require a second opinion and by institute a peer-review proces other recommendation for decrease cesarean delivery rate include eliminate incentive for physician and hospital by equalize reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean delivery public dissemination of physician and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rate to increase public awarenes of

cancer institute the national institute of allergy and infectiou disease the nih office of aid research and the procter and gamble company among the topic discuss be the epidemiology of hiv lesion ethic professional responsibility and public policy occupational issue provision of oral care to the hiv-positive population salivary hiv transmission and mucosal immunity opportunistic infection pediatric hiv infection and woman issue recommendation recommendation emerge from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesion and rate of progression of hiv to establish a universal terminology for hiv-associated oral lesion to look for more effective treatment for oral manifestation to expand molecular biology study to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral lesion and to study the effect of hiv therapy on oral lesion epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral manifestation of hiv infection wa convene five year ago the epidemiology of hiv infection ha hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april radically change in hiv infection wa detect and report largely in homosexual and bisexual male

discussion on the social and political implication of hiv infection focus on change the public attitude that aid be retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speaker also address health care delivery for hiv-infected patient and the need to educate the public about what aid be and how it be acquire saliva and salivary gland conference speaker describe transmission issue and the hiv-inhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which vary among the different salivary secretion whole saliva ha a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretion which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretion research ha show that at least two mechanism be responsible for salivary inhibitory activity they attribute the hiv-inhibitory effect of saliva to the of hiv by saliva which may both promote clearance of viru and prevent it reach a target cell and direct effect on the viru or target cell other topic discuss be the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hiv-infected person and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issue pediatric aid recently ha emerge a an area of intense interest with early and accurate diagnosi and proper treatment the life expectancy of hiv infect child ha triple the prevention of transmission of hiv from mother to child may be possible in many case particularly if the mother sero-statu be know prior to give birth periodontal and gingival tissue disease hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april oral health researcher continue to explore periodontal disease and gingivitis find in
