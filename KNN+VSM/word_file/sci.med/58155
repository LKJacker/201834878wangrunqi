from linda subject re morbu meniere be there a real remedy in article geb gordon bank write in article linda write my biggest resentment be the doctor who make it seem like most person with dizzines can be cure that definitely not the case in most case like i say above it be a long tediou proces that may or may not end up in a partial cure be sure to say chronic dizzines not just dizzines most patient with acute or subacute dizzines will get better the vertiginou spell of meniere will also eventually go away however the patient be leave with a deaf ear all true and all good point to anyone suffer with vertigo dizzines or any variation thereof my best advice to you a a fellow-sufferer be thi just keep search do let the doctor tell you there nothing that can be do do ymy own research and let ymy thi may have help you but i not sure it be good general advice the odd that you be go to find some miracle with ymy own research that be secret or hide from general knowledge for thi or any other disease be slim when good answer to these then spend a great deal of time and energy on the medical problem may divert that energy from more productive thing in life a limit amount should be spend to assure yourself that ymy doctor give you the correct story but after it become clear that you be deal with a problem for which medicine ha no good solution perhap the best strategy be to join the support group and keep abreast of new find but not to make a career out of it well make a career out of it be a bite strong i still believe that do ymy own research be very very necessary i would not have progress a much a i have today unles i have spend the many hour in stanford med library a i have do and year ago it wa clear that there wa no medicine that would help me so should i have stop search thank goodnes i do now i find that there be indeed medicine that help me i think that what you say be kind of idealistic that you would go to one doctor get a diagnosi maybe get a second opinion and then move on with ymy life just a an example have see of the top specialist in thi field in the country i have receive different diagnosis these be the top name the one that person come to from all over the country i have had to sort all of thi out myself going to a support group and in fact heading that support group wa helpful for a while but after a point i find it very unproductive it wa much more productive to do library research make phone call and put together the piece of the puzzle myself a recent movie lorenzo oil offer a perfect example of what i talk about if you have see it you should it not a put down of doctor and neither be what i say doctor be only human and can only do so much but there be those of u out here who be intelligent and able to sometime find a miss piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise go unnoticed i gues i bias because dizzines be one of those weird thing that be still so unknown if i have a break arm or a weak heart or fail kidney i might not have the same opinion that because those thing be much more tangible and have much more concise definition and treatment with dizzines you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while try to find ymy way out of it i have choose the latter linda linda gordon bank skepticism be the chastity of the intellect and geb it be shameful to surrender it too soon
