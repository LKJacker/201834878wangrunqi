from robin robin coutellier subject critique of pressure point massager a promise below be a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently buy from the self care catalog i be very please with the result the catalog description be a follow the pressure point massager be an aggressive physical massager that actually knead the tension out of muscle much like a professional shiatsu masseur the powerful motor drife two counter-rotating thumb that move in one-inch orbit release tension in the neck back leg and arm pressure point massager to order or receive a catalog call hour day or fax at note when i order the massager the item number wa different and the price wa not when i receive it i glance thru the newer catalog enclose with it to see anything wa different from the first one i wa quite annoy to see a difference in price i call them about it and the cust rep say that they have switch manufacturer although it look and work exactly the same he tell me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one use the price difference a a reason for return in fact since the newer one might take a while to ship from the factory i receive thi one in day he tell me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrife then return the old one very reasonable person i have long-term neck shoulder and back pain if i be a build i would be describe a structurally unsound i have stretch and exercise to do that help but the problem never really go away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illnes not enough time lazy etc the muscle become quite stiff and painful and thu more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometime require physical therapy to get back on track which require a doctor visit to get the prescription for the tension in my neck if not release eventually cause a headache sometime confuse with a sinu headache over my leave eye when my physical therapist ha massage my neck and the sub-occipital muscle in particular the knobby area near the base of the skull the headache usually ease within a day although it hurt like hell to while it be be massage i order thi device because it seem to be exactly what i wa wish someone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and sub-occipital muscle like my physical therapist ha do in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient appt for a week later would be need to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary i have be use it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit be about a x rectangle about high with handle on each side and it plug into an average outlet the two metal thumb be about in diameter and protrude about above the base the thumb be cover with a gray cloth that be non-removable they be locate more toward one end rather than center see figure below they move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise direction depend on which side of the switch be push and be very quiet it can be use from either side for instance the thumb can be position at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depend on which direction you approach it for the the user vary the amount of pressure use by if lay down allow all or part of the full weight of the head neck to rest on the thumb the handle can also be use if sit or stand apply pressure with the since my wrist be also impair i type thi over an extend period of time and i do have someone live with me who can apply it lay down work well for me for my back i sit in a high-backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massage and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it the pressure of lean back hold it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inch whenever i feel like it for my back thi machine be far superior to use than the commonly use home-made massager of tenni ball tap together with the ball position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tenni ball be better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if ymy quad be not in good shape and my long hair get painfully in the way if i do pin it up first a far a i concern the easier something like thi be to use the more likely i it if there be multiple i more likely to not bother with it not only ha thi machine help with my headach but my range of motion for my neck and back be greatly increase the first time i use it on my muscle however i overdo it and press too hard against it which result in a very tender almost bruise area for a few day i lay off it for about day and apply ice which help after that i wa more gradual about apply pressure at thi point the pain in the sub-occipital area be now minimal while be massage i also learn to use very light pressure on my lower back which be the most vulnerable point for me it also ease some painful knot of tension between my shoulder blade although again it take a few day of massage just a few minute at a time to really work it out i highly recommend thi product if you have similar problem although i can not vouch for it durability it seem pretty sturdy since i have it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscl before exercise and maybe after too i have be ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few week so thi wa very timely for me thi be the product i order from thi company and only recently become aware of it thru a co-worker the catalog state they have be in busines since it contain quite a few health care product and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog product they also appear to be of much higher quality with more think put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other one i see such a dr leonard health care catalog or mature wisdom i only but have end up on some geriatric-type mail list no big surprise here i consider many of those product to be rip-off particularly target toward the elderly with dubiou health benefit i apologize for the length of thi but it the kind of info i would like to know before order something thru the mail robin coutellier northern telecom mountain view ca internet robin uucp portal ntmtv robin
