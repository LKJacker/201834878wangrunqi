from lady lee lady subject re science and methodology wa homeopathy tradition in article turpin russell turpin write not imply that all their treatment be ineffective it do imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reason be incapable of discover which treatment be effective and which be not to start with no methodology or form of reason be infallible so there a question of how much certainty we be will to pay for in a give context insistence on too much rigor bog science down completely and make progress impossible expenditure of sufficiently large sum of money and amount of time can sometime overcome thi on the other hand with too little rigor much be lose by base work on result which eventually turn out to be false there be a moras of study contradict other study and outsider start say you person call thi science my opinion for what it worth be that one see both these phenomenon happen simultaneously in some part of psychology some subjective judgement be require to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation i do believe it be ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science my second point though be that highly capable person can often make extremely reliable judgement about scientific validity even when use methodology consider inadequate by the usual standard i think thi be true of many scientist and i think it be true of many who approach their discipline in a way that be not generally recognize a scientific within mathematics i think there be several example especially before the twentieth century one conspicuou case be that of riemann who be famou for many theorem he state but do not prove later mathematician do prove them of course i think that for a good scientist empirical investigation be often not so much a matter of determine what be true and what not a it be a matter of convince other person person have propose lot of incompatible definition of science here but i think the ability to objectively convince other of the validity of one result be an essential element not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific proces but i think that if one be not move toward that goal then one be not do science when a person other than a scientist be quite good at what he do and seem to be very successful at it i think that hi judgement be also worthy of respect and that hi assertion be well worth further investigation in article i write namely be there really justification for the belief that science be a superior path to truth than non-scientific approach admittedly my question wa not at all well pose a considerable amount of effort in a seriou scholarly investigation such a i suggest would be require simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer the science i wa think of in my question be the actual science currently practice now in the last decade of the twentieth century i certainly wa think of some idealize science or the mere use of reason and observation one thing i have in mind in my suggestion wa the question a to whether in many case the subjective judgement of skilled and experience practitioner might be more reliable than statistical study since russell turpin seem to be much more familiar than i be with the study of scientific methodology perhap he can tell u if there be any exist research relate to thi question in the argument between behaviorist and cognitivist psychology seem le like a science than a collection of compete religiou sect lady lady
