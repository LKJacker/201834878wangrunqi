from banschbach subject how to prevent kidney stone formation i get ask in scus med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production toxic kidney stone formation i decide to post my answer here a well because of the recent question about kidney stone not long after i get into scus med i get flame by a medical fellow for state that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation i go to state it again here but the best way to prevent kidney stone from form be to take supplement read on to find out why i have my asbesto suit on now guy vitamin c will form oxalic acid but large dose be need above gram per day review article nutritional factor in calcium contain kidney stone with particular emphasi on vitamin c int clin nutr rev but glycine also form oxalic acid d-amino acid oxidase for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best way to drastically reduce thi production be not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase ymy intake of vitamin control of hyperoxalurium with large dose of pyridoxine in patient with kidney stone int urol nephrol to mg of each day significasntly decrease the urinary excretion of oxalate over the month treatment program the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxalurium clin scus patient receive at least each day show a significant reduction in urinary oxalate level for gylcine thi effect be due to increase transaminase activity be require for transaminase activity which make le glycine available for oxidative deamination d-amino acid oxidase for vitamin c the effect be quite different there be different pathway for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that lead to oxalic acid formation will usually have to of the ingest dose go into oxalic acid but thi be highly variable and the vitamin c review article point out that unles the dose get upto gram per day not too much vitamin c get catabolize to form oxalic acid at very high dose of vitamin c above gram per day more of the extra vitamin c more than conversion can end up a oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production proc soc exp biol med intake of gram per day up to gram per day increase the average oxalic acid excretion from per day up to per day until gram per day wa reach the average excrete wa increase by only to per day gram dose gram dose gram dose and dose gram jump it to over the average excretion before supplementation and gram jump it to mg over the average before supplementation be require by more enzyme than any other vitamin in the body there be probably some enzyme that require vitamin that we do know about yet vitamin c catabolism be still not completely understand but the speculation be that thi other pathway that do not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that require difference in level could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge thi be not the prefer route of catabolism increasing ymy intake of would then result in le oxalic acid be formmed if you take vitamin c supplement since the typical american diet be deficient in some researcher believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate kidney stone be deficiency especially since so little oxalic acid get absorb from the gut diet provide to of oxalic acid per day show absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate urol if wa present each day there wa a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion here be the high oxalate food bean coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least beet top carrot celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanut pepper sweet potatoe contain to if the threshold be per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent med article also point out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation be to increase ymy intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from be absorb at all if you also increase ymy intake of you should have to worry about kidney stone at all the rda for be per day for male and per day for female directly relate to protein intake can be toxic nerve damage if it be consume in dose of or more per day for an extend peroid week to month the usda food survey do in have an average intake of mg per day for male and per day for female live in the coupled with thi low intake wa a high protein diet which greatly increase the requirement a well a the presence of some of the different drug that either block absorption be metabolic antagonist of or promote excretion in the urine common one be birth control pill alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroid i tell my student to supplement all their patient that be go to get any of the drug that increase the requirement the dose recommend for patient take birth control pill be per day and thi should work for most of the other drug that increase the requirement thi would be on top of ymy dietary intake of any patient that ha a history of kidney stone formation should be give supplement one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation be to make sure ymy dietary ratio be magnesium-oxalate be much more soluble than be calcium-oxalate the magnesium calcium ratio in the concentrate urine of patient with calcium oxalate calculus invest urol effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine change producted by food-magnesium interaction j urol article magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stone j presse med there be actually about three time a many article publish in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in prevent kidney stone formation than there be for i think that i wa be pretty safe in state that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in thi news group but good old john a in mas jump all over me i gues that he do read the medical literature oh well since kidney stone can be a real pain and a lot of person suffer from them i think i tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor office martin banschbach professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine w street tulsa ok without discourse there be no remember without remember there be no learn without learn there be only ignorance from a wise man who live in china many many year ago i think that it still ha mean in today world
