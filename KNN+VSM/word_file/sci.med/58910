from lady lee lady subject re science and methodology wa homeopathy tradition in article turpin russell turpin write i agree with everything that lee lady write in her previou post in thi thread gee maybe i misjudge you russell anyone who agree with something i say ca be all bad seriously i not sure whether i misjudge you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with ymy insistence that science be mainly about avoid mistake and i still disagree with ymy contention that nobody who do use method deem scientific can possibly know what true and what not deleted material which i agree with back to lee lady these be not the rule accord to many who post to and according to these poster if it not support by carefully design control study then it not science these poster be make the mistake that i have previously criticize of adhere to a methodological recipe a carefully rule such a support the hypothesi by a carefully design and control study be too narrow to apply to all investigation i think that the requirement for particular reason to be convince depend greatly on the kind of mistake that have occur in past reason about the same kind of thing to reuse the previou example we know that conclusion from uncontrolled observation of the treatment of chronic medical problem be notoriously problematic okay so let see if we agree on thi first of all there be degree of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully control trial before we accept a absolute scientific truth to the extent that there be any such thing the effectivenes of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment be useful thi be often the best evidence we can hope for from investigator who do not have institutional or corporate support in thi case it make sense to tentatively treat claim a credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientist who be qualify and have the necessary resource can do more careful test secondly it make sense to be more tolerant in my standard of evidence for a pronounce effect than for one that be marginal i come to thi dispute about what science be not only a a mathematician but a a veteran of many argument in and occasionally in about nlp neurolinguistic programming much of the work do to date by nlper can be better categorize a informal exploration than a careful scientific research for year now i have be try to get scientific and clinical psychologist to just take a look at it to read a few of the book and watch some of the videotape courtesy of ymy local university library not for the purpose of make a definitive judgement but simply to look at the nlp methodology especially the approach to elicit information from subject and look for idea and hypothesis which might be of scientific interest and most especially to be aware of the question nlp suggest which might be worthy of scientific investigation over and over again the response i get in be if thi ha be thoroughly validate by the accept form of empirical research then it ca be of any interest to u to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme there get to be control study position be an nlp technique call the fast cure simple phobia a oppose to agoraphobium may not be the world most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them be that it do take a sophisticate instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone be cure of one the nlp phobium cure be a simple visualization which require le than minute nlper claim that it can also be use to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence be useful in treat post-traumatic stres syndrome it be essentially a variation on the classic desensitization proces use by behavioral therapist a subject only need to be take through the technique once or in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident the proces do need to be repeat and the subject do need to practice it over again at home now to me it seem pretty easy to test the effectivenes of thi cure especially if a nlper claim the succes rate be extremely high take someone with a fear of height a i use to have take them up to a balcony on the floor and observe their response spend minute to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if thing have change check back with them in a few week to see if the cure seem to be last more long term follow-up be certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that last several week ha significance in any case there be many know case where the cure ha last year to the best of my knowledge there be no know case where the cure ha be reverse after hold for a few week my own cure incidentally wa do with a slightly different nlp technique before i learn of the fast cure ten year later now i enjoy live on the floor of my build and have a large balcony the folk over in have a hundred and one excuse not to make thi simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioner many of whom make a barely marginal live from their practice can ill afford to do most of them be also just plain not interest because the whole idea seem frivolou and since they not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible reward to gain from scientific acceptance the fast cure be over ten year old now and the clinical psychology establishment be still say we do have any way of know that it effective these academic themself have the resource to do a study a elaborate a anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove ymy theory and the burden of proof be on the one make the claim one academic in say that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobium cure since it ha be describe in a scientific journal it describe in a number of book and i post article in describe it in a much detail a i capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study ha be do with favorable result but it apparently not acceptable because it a doctoral dissertation and not publish in a referee journal to me thi sort of attitude do not advance science but hinder it thi be the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaire attitude about science now maybe i have be unfair in impute such attitude to you russell if so i apologize in the argument between behaviorist and cognitivist psychology seem le like a science than a collection of
