from jim zisfein subject post polio syndrome information needed please ks from keith keith stewart ks my wife ha become interest through an acquaintance in post-polio syndrome ks thi apparently be not recognise in new zealand and different sympton eg ks chest complaint be treat separately do anone have any information i not sure that thi condition be recognise anywhere in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criterium clear boundary between it and other disease unique pathologic or physiologic feature etc but here go with what many neurologist agree on post-polio syndrome patient have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination emg and muscle biopsy the abnormality be mostly chronic due to old polio but there be evidence of ongoing deterioration clinically the patient complain of decline strength and endurance with everyday motor task musculoskeletal pain be a nearly universal feature that doubtles contribute to the impair performance the examination show muscle weaknes and atrophy the emg show evidence of old denervation with reinnervation giant and long-duration motor unit action potential and evidence of active denervation fibrillation potential the biopsy also show old denervation with reinnervation fiber-type group and evidence of active denervation small angulate fiber with dense oxidative enzyme stain but curiously little or no group atrophy post-polio patient do not have al in al there be clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next in post-polio the patient be remarkably stable in objective find from one year to the next of course there be patient who have polio before who develop genuine al but al be no more common among polio survivor than among person who never have polio the cause of post-polio syndrome be unknown there be little evidence that post-polio patient have active polio viru or destructive immunologic response to viru antigen there be no solid evidence that patient with post-polio have anything different happen to the motor unit anterior horn cell motor axon neuromuscular junction and muscle fiber than patient with old polio who be not complain of deterioration both group can have the same emg and biopsy find the reason for these acute change in a chronic disease old polio be unknown possibly spinal motor neuron that have reinnervated huge number of muscle fiber start shed the load after several year there be a couple of clinical feature that distinguish post-polio syndrome patient from patient with old polio who deny deterioration the pp patient be more likely to have have severe polio the pp patient be much more likely to complain of pain they also tend to score higher on depression scale of neuropsychologic test my take on thi i sure some will disagree after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal load on muscle tendon ligament bone and joint that lead to inflammatory degenerative condition affect these structure the increase pain superimpose on the chronic but unchanging weaknes lead to progressive impairment of motor performance and adl i be perhap bias by personal experience of have never see a pp patient who wa not limit in some way by pain i do not believe that pp patient have more rapid deterioration of motor unit than non-pp patient those with old polio of similar severity but without pp complaint slmr e-mail jim zisfein
