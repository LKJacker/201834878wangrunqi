from km ken mitchum subject re how about a crash program in basic immunological research in article wuvmd gary kronk write i have be contemplate thi idea for some time a well i be not a doctor but my wife be a nurse and i know a lot of doctor and nurse the point here be that doctor and nurse do not seem to get sick nearly a much a person outside the medical profession thi be a lovely area for anecdote but i be sure you be on to something a a physician i almost never get sick usually when something horrendou be go around i either do get it at all or get a very mild case when i do get really sick it be alway something unusual thi wa not the situation when i wa in medical school particularly on pediatric i never have younger sibling myself and when i go on the pediatric ward i suddenly find myself confront all sort of infectiou challenge that my body wa not ready for pediatric for me wa three solid month of illnes and i have a temp of when i take the final exam i think what happen be that during train and beyond we be constantly expose to new thing and we have the usual reaction to them so that later on when challenge with something it be more likely a re-exposure for u so we deal with it well and get a mild illnes i do think it be that the immune system be hype up in any way also do forget that the hospital flora be very different from the home and we carry a lot of that around km
