from sfegu subject re barbecued food and health risk in article mmm mark robert thorson write i do understand the assumption that because something be find to be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the i think that no there be something call the delany amendment which make carcinogenic food additive illegal in any amount thi wa pass by congres in the before stuff like ma spectrometry become available which increase detectable level of substance by a couple order of magnitude thi be why thing like cyclamate and red be ban they be very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantity in rat so under the act they be ban thi also apply to natural carcinogen some of you might remember a time back in the when root beer suddenly stop taste so good and never taste so good again that wa the time when safrole wa ban thi be the active flavor ingredient in sassafra leaf if it be possible to market a root beer good like the old day someone would do it in order to make money the fact that no one do it indicate that enforcement be still in effect an odd exception to the rule seem to be the product know a gumbo file thi be nothing more than coarsely grind dry sassafra leaf thi be not only a natural product but a natural product still in it natural form so maybe that how they evade delany or maybe a special exemption wa make to appease powerful louisiana democrat i think what we have to keep in mind be that even though it may be illegal to commercially food with carcinogenic substance it be not illegal for person to do such to their own food smoke etc is thi true
