from jer rathmann janice e subject re sinu v migraine wa re sinu endoscopy i notice several year ago that when i take analgesic fairly regularly motrin at the time i seem to get a lot of migraine but have forget about that until i start read some of the post here i generally do take nsaid or tylenol for headach because i find them to be ineffective however i have two other pain source that force me to take nsaid currently naprosyn first be some pelvic pain that i get at the begin of my period and then much worse at midcycle i have have surgery for endometriosi in the past year ago so the dr tell me that my pain be probably due to the endometriosi come back i try synarel it reduce the pain while i take it mo but the pain return immediately after i stop three doctor have suggest hysterectomy a the only real solution to my problem although i do expect to have any more child i do like the idea of have my uteru and one remain ovary remove the first ovary wa remove when i have the surgery for endometriosi one of the dr that suggest i get a hysterectomy be an expert in laser surgery but perhap think that type of procedure be only worthwhile on woman who still plan to have child so basically all i leave with be toughing out the pain thi would be impossible without naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin that do work and motrin give me horrible gastritis a few year ago so i through with it in fact naprosyn work very well at eliminate the pain if i take it regularly a i do when i have severe back pain and pain in both leg a i discus in a moment generally though i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it take several hour for it reduce the pain it actually quite effective at reduce the pain it just take quite a while in the meantime i frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have be chronic lower back pain result in bilateral radiculopathy i have mri xray ct scan and emg i have of them and do intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction test the test have not be conclusive a to what be cause my back and leg pain the mrus report both say i have several bulge degeneratig disk and from the xray and mrus i think it be apparent that i have arthritis the read on the ct scan wa that there be two herniation and but other hav look at the film and conclude that there be no herniation the second emg and nerve conduction study show significant denervation compare to the first emg oh yeah i have some other horrible test call something like somatic evoked response which show that the internal nerve be work fine anyway the bottom line be that i sometime have severe pain in both leg and back pain the back pain be there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain be there i need some medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work so i take naprosyn regulary for month every time i try to stop the leg pain get worse so i alway resume since last november i have take it much le frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain i have be go to physical therapy for the last month time a week after the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she have try it earlier but it have cause a lot of pain in my back thi time she try it at a lower weight after a month or two the pain in my leg begin go away but the traction away cause discomfort in my lower back which could be reduce with ultrasound and massage so now i do have nearly a much pain in my leg in fact my therapist take me off traction about week ago getting back to my original reason for thi post even if i can avoid take analgesic for headach i really ca avoid them entirely because i have other pain source that force me to use them oh i forget to mention that it ha be suggest to me that i have back surgery but i avoid that too i find the migraine difficult to deal with occassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but at a reduce capacity i a system engineer and do a lot of read and write when the pelvic pain be bad i ca concentrate much i usually end up jump out of my chair every few minute because the pain be so bothersome when the pain in my back be bad it can cause severe burn in both leg shoot pain in my leg electric shock type of pain in my foot and to and basically when it get bad i ca really sit at all then i end up spend most of my time home and in bed so even if the analgesic contribute to the migraine the migraine be more tolerable than the other pain source i get a lot of migraine an average of to a month which last day i take cafergot the first time the caffiene really get to me so i reduce the dosage but i do like the side effect if i take more than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i will eventually take the cafergot my neurologist wa very helpful when i tell him my problem with cafergot he say that when sumatriptan become available i should try that i try several other medication fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but they either do work or i could tolerate them so what can i do my doctor seem to be satisfy with me just try to tolerate the pain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot of pain i have some bad experience with surgery my heart stop once from the anesthesium i wa tell that it wa likely the succinylcholine and i already have surgery several time anyway the point of what i say be that even if analgesic can contribute to migraine some person need to take them to tolerate other pain janice rathmann
