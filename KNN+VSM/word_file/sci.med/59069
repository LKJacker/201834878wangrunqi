from aldridge jacquelin aldridge subject re good grief wa re candida albican what be it dyer steve dyer write in article noring jon noring write there be no convince evidence that such a disease exist there a lot of evidence it just ha be adequately gather and publish in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptic who quiver everytime the word or be use snort ah there go my sinuse again for example dr ivker who write the book sinu survival alway gife oh wow a classic textbook hey they laugh at einstein too before any other treatment a systemic anti-fungal such a nizoral to hi new patient if they be on braod-spectrum anti-biotic or more time in the last two year he keep a record of the result and for over patient find that over of hi patient get significant relief of symptom of course thi be only the begin for hi program yeah i bet tomorrow the world listen uncontrolled study like thi be worthles in my case a i report a few week ago i wa develop the classic symptom outline in yeast connection i agree it be a poorly write book extreme sensitivity to plastic vapor etc which i never have before start in november within one week of full dosage of sporanox the sensitivity to chemical ha fully disappear i can now sit on my couch at home without die after two minute i also greatly improve in other area a well i sure you be you sound like the typical who respond to miracle cure of course i have allergy symptom etc i be especially allergic to mold yeast etc it do take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one ha excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeast that a threshold would be reach where you would have perceptible symptom yeah it make sense to me so of course it should be take seriously snort also yeast do produce toxin of variou sort and again you do have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxin can cause problem in some person yeah it sound reasonable to me of course the question be whether a person who be immune compromise a test show i wa from over year of antibiotic nutritionally-deficiency because of the stres of infection and allergy etc oh really what test immune-compromised my a more like credulou malingerer thi be a psychiatric syndrome can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body it be a tough question to answer since test for excessive yeast colonization be not easy one almost ha to take an empirical approach to diagnosi fortunately sporanox be relatively safe unlike past anti-fungal still have to be careful however so there no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reason you know it a shame that a drug like itraconazole be be misuse in thi way it ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic the trouble be that it be toxic enough so it get abuse by quack btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grow hypha too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you find a lot of person who be on nystatin all the time the only good thing about nystatin be that it relatively cheap and when take orally non-toxic but oral nystatin be without any systemic effect so unles it be give iv it would be without any effect on ymy sinuse i wish these quack would first use iv nystatin or amphotericin b on person like you that would solve the yeast problem once and for all in summary i appreciate all of the attempt by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road but methink that some who hold too firmly to the party line be academic who have be in the trench long enough actually treat patient if anybody doctor include say to me to my face that there be no evidence of the connection i can not guarantee their safety for their incompetence rip off their lip be justify a far a i be concern perhap a little haldol would go a long way toward ameliorate ymy symptom are you pay for thi treatment out of ymy own pocket i hate to think my insurance premium be go toward thi steve dyer dyer you rude medicine be not a totallly scientific endevmy it often practice in a disorganize manner most early treatment of non-life threaten illnes be do on a gues hazard after anecdotal evidence give by the patient it an educate gues by a train person but it still no more than a gues it cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those person who do respond there be disease that have be describe yet and the root cause of many disease now describe be know read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them after scientific method have run out then it the patient freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose and it well recognize by many doctor that medicine do have all the answer thi person say that they have relief by take the medicine maybe it a miracle cure maybe it valid how do you know you might argue with the reason the conclusion but ymy disparage attack be unwarranted why do you present an convince argument for you r belief instead of waste my time in an ad hominem attack jackie
