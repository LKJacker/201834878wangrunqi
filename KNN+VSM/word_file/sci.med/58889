from mhollowa michael holloway subject re science and methodology wa homeopathy tradition in article fulk mark fulk write in article sasghm gary merrill write in article fulk mark fulk write what be wrong with the above observation be that it explicitly gife the impression and you may not in fact hold thi view that the common perhap even the correct approach for a scientist to follow be to sit around have flight of fancy and scheme on the basi of hi jealousy and petty hatred flight of fancy and other irrational approach be common the crucial thing be not to sit around just have fantasy they be of any use unles they make you do some experiment i know a lot of scientist whose fantasy lead them on to creative work usually they wo admit out loud what the fantasy wa prior to the consumption of a few beer the danger in philosophize about science be that theory and generalization can end up be far remove from the actual day-to-day of the grunt at the bench ye it great to be involve in a proces be i can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dream and just do something for the hell of it a long a my advisor do catch me which be easy enough to do but stamp out such behavior seem to be the purpose in life of grant review committee and the peer review proces in general in today world that what determine what science be what get fund and a damn good thing to flight of fantasy just do have much chance of produce anything at least not in biomedical research the surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life be to work in a lab where the bos be more concern with flesh out fantasy than with have the student work on a project that actually ha a good chance of produce some result md seem to be particularly prone to thi aberrant behavior simple example warren jelinek notice an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresi gel of human alu fragment he get very excite hop that he see some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic gene thi fantasy lead him to sequence sample of the band and carry out bind assay the result wa a well-conserved or so bp sequence that occur about time in the human genome unfortunately for warren fantasy it turn out to be a transposon that be present in so many copy because it replicate itself and copy itself back into the genome on the other hand the characteristic of transposon be much elucidate the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase wa recognize and the standard method of recognize human dna wa create other specie have different set of transposon fortunately for me warren and i use to eat dinner at friday all the time i have to agree with gary merrill response to thi i read alot of the alu and middle repetitive sequence work and it really very interest good work with implication for many field in molecular genetic it really an example of how a well reason project turn up interest result that be unexpected mike
