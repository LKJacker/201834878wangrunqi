increase in the occurrence of thi disease or more complete report stimulate by visitation to laboratory by cdh surveillance staff during the increase in confirm gonorrhea case at dmhc and in culture-positivity rate in three of fmy laboratory suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a report artifact however the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family plan laboratory which serve a network of clinic statewide indicate that the gonorrhea increase do not uniformly affect all segment of the population one possible explanation for the increase occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drug-related sexual behavior a implicate in a recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other std in colorado spring although the high morbidity censu tract in the denver metropolitan area coincide with area of gang and drug activity thi hypothesi require further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicate previously a a factor contribute to the national increase in syphili the cdh program be collect information from all person in whom gonorrhea be diagnose regard drug use exchange of sex for money or drug and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for black in colorado substantially exceed the national health objective for the year per objective race be likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other std risk marker may be useful for identify group at greatest risk for std and for target prevention effort moreover race specific variation in std rate may reflect difference in factor such a socioeconomic statu acces to medical care and high-risk behavior in response to the increase occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado intervention initiate by the cdh program include target partner

lead cause of death among child and young adult in the united state and account for more than million year of potential life lose before age annually child safety seat and safety belt can substantially reduce thi los from through all state pass legislation require the use of child safety seat or safety belt for child although these law reduce injury to young child by an estimate motor-vehicle crash-related injury remain a major cause of disability and death among child while the use of occupant restraint among child decrease inversely with age usage for those age year age year and age year in addition parent who do not use safety belt themself be le likely to use restraint for their child to characterize the association between adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraint for the youngest child age le than year within a household cdc analyze datum obtain from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfs during and thi report summarize the find from thi study datum be available for respondent age greater than or equal to year in state that participate in brfs a population-based random-digit-dialed telephone survey and administer a standard injury control and child safety module develop by cdc of these respondent have a child age le than year in their household each respondent wa ask to specify the child age and the

alone in nine state child-passenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april law include all child age le than year but the other two state use both age and size of the child a criterium for mandatory restraint use the analysi in thi report subgrouped state into those have a law require adult safety-belt use law state and those without such a law no-law state overall of child age le than year reportedly be not consistently restrain during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use be significantly higher p le than chi-square test in law state than in no-law state versu and versu respectively high rate of restraint use for child age le than or equal to year be report by both adult indicate consistent and le than consistent safety-belt use figure adult with consistent use report high rate of child-occupant restraint use regardles of the child age range for to for in comparison for adult report le than consistent safety-belt use the rate of child occupant restraint use decline sharply by the age of the child range for to for when compare child of consistent adult safety-belt user with child of le than consistent adult safety-belt user confidence interval overlap for the two youngest age group age le than and year reported child-occupant restraint use in law state generally exceed that in no-law state regardles of age of child table in addition higher adult educational attainment wa significantly associate with increase restraint use for child a factor that ha also be associate with increase adult safety-belt use reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the find in thi report be consistent with other indicate that adult who do not use safety belt themself be le likely to employ occupant restraint for their child because these nonbelted adult be at increase risk of crash and more likely to exhibit other risk-taking behavior child travel with them may be at greater risk for motor-vehicle injury educational attainment of adult respondent wa inversely associate with child restraint use in thi report accordingly occupant-protection program should be promote among parent with low educational attainment because low educational attainment be often associate with low socioeconomic statu such program should be offer to adult through health-care facility that serve low-income community or through federal program head start that be direct at parent with young child injury-prevention program emphasize restrain young child in addition however effort must be intensify to protect child occupant a hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april they become older parent especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belt and those from state that do not have mandatory safety-belt use law should be encourage to wear safety belt and to protect their child by use approve child safety seat and safety belt finally the increase use of restraint among child may increase their likelihood of use safety belt when they become teenager the

microcephalu obstruction of the and may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however difference in the prevalence of limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy down syndrome be probably not attributable to difference in ascertainment because these defect be relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional difference in prenatal diagnosi and pregnancy termination may affect prevalence of trisomy and spina bifida however the reason for difference in reduction be unknown but may be relate to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or

following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer ivf et baby in a host of assist reproductive technology have be develop that include ivf-et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freeze and gamete micromanipulation together these technology be refer to a the high-tech assist reproductive technology art procedure ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease pathology still be the mainstay of the therapy available for infertility management however when these fail it almost alway be appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedure therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there be a program of assisted reproduction that specialize in art procedure thi program serve a a tertiary provider for those patient in the state of arizona whose infertility problem can not be resolve by the traditional therapy the follow article on back describe the art procedure available in my center clarify appropriate application for each and consider the realistic expectation for their succes procedure include be o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivf-et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryo and gamete micromanipulation thi article also consider ongoing research in my program that be direct toward improve succes of these technology hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april future area of research in addition to ongoing research that be direct exclusively toward the management of infertile couple we be develop the technology to assist couple who be at risk for produce embryo with a seriou hereditary disease thi technology involf biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subject the biopsied cell to genetic analysi use either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there be recent report of the successful application of dna amplification by other center for example for diagnosi of the gene for cystic fibrosi and hemophilium we hope to apply and further focu fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probe the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basi for counsel patient who exhibit sex-linked disorder the considerable clinical application of such technology ly in the fact that it circumvent the need for prenatal diagnosi in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affect fetuse in order to avoid the birth of affect child catherine racowsky associate professor and director of research department of obstetric and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson arizona application succes rate and advance for the management of infertility the follow be the art procedure available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer be the core art procedure of my assisted reproduction program thi procedure involf retrieval of unfertilized egg from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryo for or day before they be transfer to the patient uteru all culture be maintain in an incubator under strictly control atmospheric and temperature condition before be process for use in insemination seman sample be evaluate in my andrology laboratory use both subjective light microscopy and computer hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april assist seman analysis to ensure an adequate number of egg with which to perform ivf-et or indeed gift follicular development be typically stimulate with gonadotropin perganol metrodin gonadotropin release hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse gnrh analogue lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivf-et be accomplish with egg obtain in non-stimulated cycle while some program utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operate room with the patient under general anesthesium we undertake the le costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in my infertility unit with the patient sedate couple who resort to ivf-et exhibit such pathology a tubal deficiency ovulatory dysfunction endometriosi mild form of male factor infertility according to the united state ivf registry the overall succes rate for ivf-et nationwide ha stabilize at about percent per cycle result from my program involve patient who have undergo ivf-et cycle reflect a comparable succes rate nevertheles the overall incidence of succes with thi procedure be disconcertingly low and emphasize the need to addres those physiological factor that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancy well recognize predictor of outcome include patient age response to exogenou ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeat ivf-et cycle attempt however among these age be the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it be critical that such patient be refer to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity follow failure of traditional therapy the underlie basi for the negative effect of age on fertility ha not be clearly delineate beyond recognition that the number of egg available for retrieval decline markedly with age fertilization rate significantly decrease in egg retrieve from patient who be over year and provide the appropriate hormonal background be present age be unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in my center therefore be investigate physiological change in the egg that may be impact by age we have determine that more than percent of egg that fail to fertilize in vitro be chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormality be accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patient be to use egg obtain from a donor my program ha initiate recruitment of volunteer egg donor to satisfy the need of a list of recipient interest in thi form of therapy gift thi high-tech art procedure be perform in the operate room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivf-et involf introduce sperm and freshly retrieve egg into the luman of the fallopian tube an average of under these circumstance fertilization occur in vivo and if exces egg be retrieve the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent option for embryo transfer in that cycle or freeze for transfer in a subsequent cycle thi art procedure be apply to case in hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april which there be at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple ha such pathology a ovulatory dysfunction endometriosi male factor infertility idiopathic infertility the datum report in the united state ivf registry for through indicate that the overall succes rate with gift be higher than that obtain with the ivf-et technique range of clinical pregnancy for gift be to percent and for ivf-et to percent in view of thi fact one might expect more patient to be treat with gift than ivf-et however in my program we have take into account three basic concern which while substantially reduce the number of gift cycle perform benefit the patient these concern be the increase cost associate with perform a procedure in the operate room the risk albeit minimal of undergo general anesthesium and the considerable benefit to be accrue from obtain direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the egg and the developmental competency of resultant embryo the increase succes with gift undoubtedly reflect the artificial environment provide by the laboratory in the ivf-et procedure between january and december we have perform a total of gift cycle with an overall succes rate of percent embryo cryopreservation or freeze be apply in my program when embryo result from residual gift egg or from non-transferred ivf embryo thi procedure not only provide patient with a subsequent opportunity for succes at much reduce cost but also circumvent the legal and ethical issue relate to disposal of supernumerary embryo therefore a stipulate by the american fertility society ethical guideline for art program from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction program should have the capability of cryopreserving human embry gamete micromanipulation thi art procedure which be still very new be apply to couple who be unaccepting of insemination with donor seman but who have severe male factor infertility le than million in combination with fewer than perccent motile sperm le than percent sperm with normal morphology we be currently develop the procedure of sub-zonal insertion szi which entail inject sperm under the coat around the egg the barrier normally penetrate by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available datum from szi program world-wide indicate that only to percent of szi cycle result in a pregnancy thi statistic undoubtedly relate to limitation impose by abnormality inherent in the sperm therefore we be currently focus on the development of improve technique for the recognition and selection of sperm choose for manipulation such effort be unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that thi technology offer the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patient to establish conception catherine
