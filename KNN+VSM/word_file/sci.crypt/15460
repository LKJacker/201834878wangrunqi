from marc vanheyningen mvanheyn subject re more technical detail encrypt under k then k will be encrypt under the unit key uk and the serial number of the unit add to produce a three part message which will then be encrypt under the system key sk produce e e m k e k uk serial number sk my understand be that e m k be not encrypt under sk call the family key and that the decrypt key correspond to sk be hold by law enforcement do anyone have first hand knowledge on thi i will also check it out but thi be sunday so i do not want to wait ok so there be in fact two distinct component transmit by the chip the real message encrypt with the conventional key and the serial number and encrypt conventional key encrypt with the imho kind of bogu a the whole concept of one key that million of person use which ca be change do seem reasonable family key suppose i analyze the output of thi chip and i able to determine which bite be the encrypt packet which contain the serial number and session key suppose i also design a simple algorithm base on thi information which take the datum contain the encrypt session key and twiddle a bite or several before it send down the line mind you i sure the nsa think of thi along with a dozen other attack i ca imagine and the system be probably somehow design so that manipulation of thi information will cause a compliant receive chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully but how what if the two party agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme so the decryption chip see the restore proper bitstream but an eavesdropper get a e k uk packet that wrong i suppose thi could be easily defeat if the chip send that information out many time in slightly different way make it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information be send marc vanheyningen mvanheyn mime ripem accept if ymy theory predict different outcome depend on whether you use discrete mathematics or continuou mathematics then you get the wrong theory bruce maclennan
