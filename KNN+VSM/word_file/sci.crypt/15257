from bet bennett todd salomon brother inc ny subject re source of random bite on a unix workstation for ymy application what you can do be to encrypt the real-time clock value with a secret key well almost if i only have to solve the problem for myself and be will to have to type in a second password the secret key whenever i log in it could work however i try to create a solution that anyone can use and which once instal be just a effortles to start up a the non-solution of just use xhost to control acces i get religeou problem with store secret key on multiuser computer for a good discussion of cryptographically good random number generator check out the internet draft available at ymy local friendly internet draft repository thank for the pointer it wa good read and i like the idea of use several unrelated source with a strong mix function however unles i miss something the only source they suggest aside from a hardware rng that seem available and unguessable by an intruder when a unix be fresh-booted be buffer relate to network traffic i believe my solution basically use that strategy without require me to reach into the kernel a reasonably source of randomnes be the output of a cryptographic hash function when feed with a large amount of more-or-les random datum for example run on be a slow but random enough source of random bite there be bind to be bite of entropy in the ten or hundred of megabyte of datum in a modern workstation memory a a fair amount of them be system timer buffer etc i hear about thi solution and it sound good then i hear that folk be experience time of second to run thi on reasonably-configured workstation i not will to add that much delay to someone login proces my approach skip take a second or two to run i consider write the be-all and end-all of solution that launch the and simultaneously try to suck bite off the net and if the net should be sit so idle that it ca get after compression before finish use the thi way i could have guarantee good bite and a deterministic upper bind on login time and still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra second bennett bet
