from rbrand raymond s brand subject re clipper consider harmful in article smb steven bellovin write there be three issue with clipper the first be whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme be capable of work my answer with one significant exception be ye i really do think that nsa and nist have design thi scheme about a well a can be assume that their real objective be a state to permit wiretapping under certain carefully-controlled circumstance with a minimum risk of abuse the exception be that u exist outside of the chip on a program diskette that seriously wrong and should be load onto the chip separately to those who disagree and i do claim my answer be obviou though i find my own reason sufficiently persuasive that i wa force to rewrite the conclusion section of my technical analysi paper i have originally blast the scheme i issue thi invitation assume that you be charge with implement such a system with complete regard for civil right and due proces what would you do differently in answer thi question please accept nsa fundamental assumption that both strong cryptography against outsider and the ability to wiretap some domestic user be necessary if you feel it necessary to challenge those assumption do it in the context of the last issue i present below right here i discuss just the technical aspect and no i do by any mean claim that just because something can be do it should be ok steve here a sketch of an alternative that i believe address most of the objection to the clipper scheme notation concatenation exclusive or e m k message m encrypt by key k d m k message m decrypt by key k h m hash of message m important value x local chip unit key from escrow agency x x remote chip unit key from escrow agency x n serial number of the local chip n serial number of the remote chip a number of escrow agency k k session key agree upon external to thi protocol f family key need not be secret protocol choose a such that k a remote chip do same for k a compute the follow e a e a a l n e n a f remote chip do the same for a l send l to remote chip and receive l from remote chip compute ke h k n a k d l f kd h k d l f k n a note that d l f n a remote chip do the same for ke and kd user datum be encrypt decrypt with key ke ke kd kd assumption no trap door in e d and h h be not invertible algorithm for e d and h be secret otherwise a software implementation bogu chip could communicate with a real chip the chip only support the follow operation return n load x return e x x return e n a f given e n a f return n a load k given e n a f compute ke kd given m return e m ke given m return d m kd anything program into the chip can be determine by destroy the chip u u a f n u u a can not be determine except by destroy the chip unfortunately thi may not be true in reality i suppose it possible to determine how a chip ha be program with a sophisticate sp x-ray machine to look for blow fuse the u be program independantly by the escrow agency note for tap escrow agency y be give n e y y n e y y and return y y lea must contact all escrow agency with the serial number from both chip and the encrypt partial key thi allow the agency to record that both chip be tap lea only get the session key not the key to all conversation of a particular chip thi preclude real-time decrypt of a conversation but that be one of the stated requirement observation in order for any secure by tap-able communication scheme to work the active part need to share a secret and if thi secret be reveal communication by those that know the secret can be make un-tap-able obviou candidate be the cryptographic algorithm and the master family key relative size and complexity suggest that the key can be obtain from a silicon implementation of the scheme a lot easier and faster than the algorithm rsbx raymond s brand rbrand
