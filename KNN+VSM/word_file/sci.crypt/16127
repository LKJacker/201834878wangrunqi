from philippe hoogvorst subject re clipper chip in article jb write is it realistic for the government to try to keep the detail of the encrytion algorithm secret if it intend to use evidence from jame b shearer i do not think they can use the eavesdrop a evidence at all however use the info they gather while listen they can go search the right place and find good strong evidence which they can use in court question currently it be easy to wire-tap from the technical point of view at least anybody use the appropriate radio receiver can listen to communication between a car-telephone and the grind station the polouse also obviously the clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the non-authorized person to eavesdrop note that i do not write impossible the privacy will thu improve from the current situation poeple who really have something to hide already do not use the phone to speak of these thing if an illegal operation be really worth one can afford have critical datum carry by a person rather than send it electronically the clipper chip will not change thi the problem be more politic foreign country will never accept the clipper chip be the acces to the escrow can not be directly grant to their own polouse follow their own law not the u law each country will have it own escrow how then will it be possible to monitor the international traffic or will encrypt international traffic be possible or will there be an international escrow some kind of thing forbidding crypted communication be impractical how be it possible to spot a crypted communication in the thousand of megabyte of datum which circulate on the variou exist network what about private network and thi will be more and more impossible a the volume of electronic traffic will increrase in the next year i think that the clipper chip can only be an interest device to limit the risk of for instance one girlfriend husband listen to hi wife communication it will bring no more a regard to security is it worth i think so if it cost be limit i think that many privacy invasion be do not only by official service but also by private entity the clipper can help reduce these provided we do not hope too much of it it be not a real danger and it can be helpful ph hoogvorst
