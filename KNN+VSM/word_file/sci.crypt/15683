from koontzd david koontz subject will fed troll for mutilate law enforcement block from denning the skipjack encryption algorithm f an family key that be common to all chip n a serial number u an secret key that unlock all message encrypt with the chip e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block where the session key be k and be transmit encrypt in the unit key u which along with the serial number n be encrypt in the family key f presumably the protocol can be recover if by nothing else differential analysi postulate if you will a chip or logic sit between the clipper chip and it communication channel the function of thi spoof chip be twofold transmit channel the spoof chip xor the bite encrypt serial number with a secondary key variable thi render the serial number unrecoverable with just the family key receive channel the spoof chip xor the incoming encrypt serial number with a secondary key variable assume integrity of the law enforcement block be necessary for local operation checksum sequence control etc thi ha the net result of hide the serial number it be probable theere be a know plaintext pattern use a a filler in the block contain n bite a use in generate u correctnes of the law enforcement block can be determine with only the family key f wherea no one ha propose federal agency be deny f and because they could recover it themself the correctnes of the serial number can be test by examine the pad bite of n in e n f the one could selectively alter the law enforcement block a above but the mutilation could be detect a better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block if it be do with a group encryption scheme such a de or presumably skipjack the chance the law enforcement block can be recover be lessen what do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognize and the serial number decrypt in a target search when digital transmission become widely available would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmission be refuse when contain mutilate law enforcement block one way to avoid notice would be to spoof protocol information of the block contain m a well a spoof the law enforcement block the goal be to use a secure communication scheme without redres to detection or key k interception contain encrypt within the law enforcement block the datum stream be return to it original state for use by the clipper chip or system if require for proper operation it be somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contain within the clipper chip yet likely that sequence of event will be test for require a valid law enforcement block to be receive before accept and decrypt e m k the spoof chip could be implement anywhere in the protocol include on the result serial datum stream existing clipper product could be subborned after all they be high security encryption system right super could allow the chip to be use without redres to detection of the use of the chip or disclosure of the serial number security must be adequate to deny the serial number which should not be recoverable by other mean one can see the use of cut out for procurring clipper phone or once the number of unit be high enough steal them it would be a mistake on the part of authority but nice from a point of privacy if the serial number n be not associate with a particular clipper chip or lot of chip through the manufacture and distribution proces hopefully the list of know miss or steal clipper serial number n encrypt with f and the protocol be not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypt clipper stream thi could be further make difficult by alter the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypt stream detection of an encrypt stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme if you could capture valid law enforcement block not ymy own and use them in a codebook sustitution with ymy own where they point to a valid law enforcement block store in a library utilize a session key match the remainder of the transmission you could simply out and out lie yet deliver to monitor hostile force a seemingly valid law enforcement block these capture law enforcement block would be use a authenticator such a in a manually key encryption system fending thi off would require escalation in examine the protocol and block in the transmission the m code stream might be independently attack base on knowledge of clipper chip protocol a reveal plaintext thi could be invalidate by change the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper m stream and the actual transmit stream under the control of a secure key generator synchronize between endpoint the useful life time of capture law enforcement block might be limit base on hostile force use them a target follow transmission interception you would need a large number of them but hey there suppose to be million of these thing right adding time stamp to the encrypt law enforcement block be probably impractical who want an encryption chip with a real time clock the entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidate
