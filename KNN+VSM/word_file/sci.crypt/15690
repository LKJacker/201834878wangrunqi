from caronni germano caronni subject some question wa revised summary here be a revise version of my summary that correct some error and provide some additional information and explanation thank you very much after read the text some distinct question arise to me which i gues will also be ask by other person perhap would it be interest to find an answer to these question the clipper chip a technical summary n a serial number thi length be subject to change shorter or longer once the session key k be establish the clipper chip be use to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitize voice the telephone security device fee k and m into the chip to produce two value e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which be transmit over the telephone line the law enforcement field thu contain the session key k encrypt under the unit key u concatenate with the serial number n all encrypt under the family key f the law enforcement field be decrypt by law enforcement after an authorize wiretap ha be instal first question when will the lawenforcmentfield be transmit and how do the remote clipper chip handle it is it transmit periodically in the stream of encrypt block or just at the begin do the phone at the other side discard those packet vium a protocol whatsoever or try it to turn them into voice-output which would not be disturb at the begin of a session a trust agent from each of the two key escrow agency enter the vault agent enter a secret random value into the laptop and agent enter a secret random value these random value serve a seed to generate unit key for a sequence of serial number thu the unit key be a function of secret random bite where each agent know only second question why why be such a strange procedure use and not a real rng thi turn those in a kind of bottleneck for system security when law enforcement ha be authorize to tap an encrypt line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get acces to the communication line let u assume that the tap be in place and that they have determine that the line be encrypt with the clipper chip the law enforcement field be first decrypt with the family key f give e k u n documentation certify that a tap ha be authorize for the party associate with serial number n be then send vium secure fax to each of the key escrow agent who return also vium secure fax and and be xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u be decrypt to get the session key k finally the message stream be decrypt all thi will be accomplish through a special black box decoder so no technical provision will be take to place a on these warrant thi would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction by let the escrow-agency perform the decode of the session key just take modem-line instead of secure fax is thi such a bad idea a successor to the clipper chip call capstone by the government and by mykotronx ha already be develop it will include the skipjack algorithm the digital signature standard ds the secure hash algorithm sha a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer a prototoype will be available for test on april and the chip be expect to be ready for delivery in june or july wow how do the randomizer work are the sha and key exchange secret or publicly know key-exchange be dh i gues it seem that those who be oppose to thi chip shall have a tough time ymy government realy mean to act friendly greet germano caronni instrument register only through thing they design to register space still contain infinite unknown germano caronni caronni
