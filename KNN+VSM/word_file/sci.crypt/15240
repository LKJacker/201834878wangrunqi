from brad brad templeton subject once tap ymy code be no good any more it occur to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow house release ymy code to the cop ymy code be now no longer secure it in the hand of cop and while i be sure most of the time they be good their security will not be a good a the escrow house what thi effectively mean be that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligate to inform you that a tap wa perform and replace for free the clipper chip in ymy cellular phone so that it be once again a code know only to the escrow house do the polouse normally reveal every tap they do even if no charge be lay in many way it would be a positive step if they have to judge set time limit on warrant i assume at the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace ymy chip that if we go with thi scheme which i be not sure i agree with brad templeton clarinet communication corp sunnyvale ca
