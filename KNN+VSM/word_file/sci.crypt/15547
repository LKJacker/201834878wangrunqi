from sommerfeld bill sommerfeld subject a little political philosophy worth read read thi through once or twice then replace prince with government or president a appropriate and read it again from chapter xx of the prince by n macchiavelli a translate by daniel donno in order to keep their land secure some prince have disarm their subject other have prompt division within the city they have subjugate some have nurture animosity against themself other have seek to win the approval of those they initially distrust some have erect fortress other have destroy them now although it be impossible to set down definite judgement on all of these measure without consider the particular circumstance of the state where they may be employ i shall nevertheles discus them in such broad term a the subject itself will allow to begin with there ha never be a case of a new prince disarm hi subject indeed whenever he find them disarm he proceed to arm them for by arm ymy subject you make their arm ymy own those among them who be suspiciou become loyal while those who be already loyal remain so and from subject they be transform into partisan though you can not arm them all nonetheles you increase ymy safety among those you leave unarm by extend privilege to those you arm ymy different treatment of the two category will make the latter feel obligate to you while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume add duty and danger should receive advantage when you disarm ymy subject however you offend them by show that either from cowardlines or from lack of faith you distrust them and either conclusion will induce them to hate you moreover since it be impossible for you to remain unarm you would have to resort to mercenary whose limitation have already be discuss even if such troop be good however they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemy and doubtful subject therefore a i have say a new prince in a newly acquire state ha alway take measure to arm hi subject and history be full of example prove that thi be so but when a prince take posession of a new state which he annex a an addition to hi original domain then he must disarm all the subject of the new state except those who help him to acquire it and these a time and occasion permit he must seek to render soft and weak he must arrange matter in such a way that the arm of the entire state will be in the hand of soldier who be native to hi original domain and since the subject demand it i will not fail to remind any prince who ha acquire a new state by the aid of it inhabitant that he soundly consider what induce them to assist him if the reason be not natural affection for him but rather dissatisfaction with the former government he will find it extremely difficult to keep them friendly for it will be impossible to please them if he will carefully think the matter through in the light of example draw from ancient and modern affair he will understand why it be much easier to win the favor of those who be happy with their former government and hence be hi enemy than to keep the favor of those who out of dissatisfaction with the former rule help him to replace it
