from l detweiler subject an open letter to mr clinton i quite astonish shock and appal at thi seriou frontal assault on emerge american freedom the clinton administration nor any other government agency ha any legitimate role whatsoever in regulate cryptography to do so be tantamount to regulate acceptable speech and be blatantly unconstitutional perhap we should rename thi year in honor of such an illustriou proposal let the crappy chip live in infamy and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for thi bizarre misadventure i be outrage that my tax money be be use to develop technology to restrict my freedom far beyond reasonable measure the government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any seriou threat to my liberty such a thi and i call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy thi proposal the administration do not seem to understand that they be merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public and hence anyone involve in thi proposal in thi respect be wholly negligent and remis in perform their lawful duty while encryption technology can help american protect busines secret and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be use by terrorist drug dealer and other criminal it seem to me that diplomatic communication should be tappable by the whenever any country produce a warrant to the in fact i think we should stop pay the nsa billion of dollar a year to produce unbreakable code for thi reason these action violate the sovereignity of international law i hope mr clinton be shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here but if he be it a modest and reasonable proposal so he should find merit with it nevertheles cryptography be neutral technology if everybody ha strong cryptography include policeman bureacrat businessman housewife thug and hoodlum we have a sustainable equilibrium anything le be an unworkable anti-egaltarian arrangement intrinsically antithetical to american freedom and guarantee to collapse under it own weight of inherent impracticality we do need to compromise on issue of freedom for too long there ha be little or no dialogue between my private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenge of protect american for too long my government ha demonstrate itself to be increasingly hostile and a seriou obstacle to economic vitality and protect american since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy regard it use the administration be commit to policy that protect all american right to privacy while also protect them from those who break the law it be not possible for the federal government to act quickly or develop consistent comprehensive policy period and even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing be possible it would only be an efficient way to deprive american citizen of fundamental and inalienable right the administration ha to be commit to leave private industry alone esp on thi issue the government ha no legitimate role in regulate the content of communication law enforcement agency must be prepare to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon they be soon and inevitably to be disarm of it q if the administration be unable to find a technological solution like the one propose would the administration be will to use legal remedy to restrict acces to more powerful encryption device no such law can be constitutionally sound and thi be equivalent to a veil threat which i do appreciate thi kind of extortion tend to agitate me and other into radicalism i will trade threat for threat and violation for violation the administration be not say since encryption threaten the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright a some country have effectively do if the administration do say thi it would find itself impeach for reckles and outrageou disregard of essential establish entrench and explicit constitutional privacy guarantee the administration would have no legal stand whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal and wholly untolerated and disregard by vast segment of the population nor be the say that every american a a matter of right be entitle to an unbreakable commercial encryption product the comprise of a vast majority of person fanatically commit to preserve their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government be say just that take ymy chip and give them to nsa employee a christma bonuse we can run any algorithm on my computer we damn well please and we will make any chip we please and we will send any bite pattern over my datum highway we please and if you try to stop u you will be gradually or abruptly dissolve into nothingnes privacy v law enforcement there be a false tension create in the assessment that thi issue be an either-or proposition thi be an outright dingaling denning lie the two aim of privacy and surveillance be intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise american be about to discover way through the use of technology to preserve their inalienable but forget freedom that have slowly be erode away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and unrepresentative government
