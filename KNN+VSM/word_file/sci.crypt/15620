from wc bill stewart subject re the clipper chip a technical summary in article denning write prof denning description of skipjack mostly omit chip structure the clipper chip contain a classify block encryption algorithm call skipjack the algorithm use bite key compare with for the de and ha round of scramble compare with for the de it support all de mode of operation throughput be mbit a second f an family key that be common to all chip n a serial number u an secret key that unlock all message encrypt with the chip the key k and message stream m digitize voice be then feed into the clipper chip to produce two value e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block three question it look like each bite of input gife you bite of output e m k bite e k u e bite bite e e k u n f e bite bite do you really need to transmit all bite each time or do you only transmit the bite of wiretap block at the begin all would be really obnoxiou for bandwidth-limited application like cellular phone or even regular phone over how do the de mode interact with the two-part output do the variou feedback mode only apply to the message block or also to the wiretap block or if the wiretap block be only transmit at the begin do it get incorporate into everything through feedback mode but not during ecb mode do the clipper chip check the wiretap block itself do the block have to be present at all since the receive chip do know the transmitter u it presumably ca check the validity of e k u so it limit to check the form of the wiretap block and maybe check the serial number for reasonablenes unles there some sort of back-door structure that let it recognize a valid e k u in that case can you replace the wiretap block with a different wiretap block presumably an old valid one to avoid attract attention the chip wo do it so you postproces the output regular person can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key paranoid person can use someone else serial number on the other hand if i could think of that solution so easily presumably the nsa could too have they do something to block it like use message encryption that really e m k u n thank pray for peace bill bill stewart wc at t bell lab holmdel nj no i from new jersey i only work in cyberspace white house commect line fax
