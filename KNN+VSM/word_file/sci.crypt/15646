from michael t palmer subject re once tap ymy code be no good any more in article rboudrie rob boudrie write in article graham toal gtoal write in article pat pat myrto write if the clinton clipper be so very good why not make it algrithm public so many person can exchange idea and examine it rather than a few isolate expert respect by whom for what perhap a one more time if they release the algorithm it would be possible for someone to come up with an implementation which wa identical but lack an escrowed key note that the pres announcement mention that the algorithm wa be keep secret for security of the key escrow system in thi case security mean an escrowed key for every clipper chip assuming you believe all that be say about the effective of the algorithm and the escrow system which would you buy a chip from firm a with the escrowed key b second source chip from reputable firm b with no key in government escrow there would obviously be powerful economic incentive for a second source non escrowed vendor but what about second source for pin-compatible non-clipper algorithm chip that also have escrowed key if a reputable firm produce a chip with escrowed key that be a pop-in replacement for the clipper chip in my phone and use an algorithm that be widely know and evaluate and trust then what the problem the clipper be go to be reverse engineer anyway by any organization with sufficient resource can you say billion of cocaine dollar so those drug dealer they so worry about will be slip through the crack we law-abiding non-incredibly-wealthy citizen naturally will not have thi recourse but claim that the algorithm ca be release to prevent person from use non-key-escrowed chip be plain deceitful analysi of the chip output will provide information on the necessary header and whatnot so the bad guy could build chip use a different algorithm and still not escrow their key or they could just buy bunch of cheap phone at k-mart every week and play swap-the-clipper-chip with their cellular phone every day michael t palmer a man be crazy who write a secret in any other way than one which will conceal it ripem key on server from the vulgar roger bacon
