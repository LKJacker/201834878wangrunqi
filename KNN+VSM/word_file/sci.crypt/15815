from steve-b steve brinich subject re is key escrow enough the point raise about check what be actually in the chip a oppose to what be allegedly program therein raise yet another trust issue even if we assume that these trust agent be really enter a wide range of and seed rather than use the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to bite i assume they be not do so by pick up an iron file and poke it into the circuitry at carefully select point to encode datum they would presumably be punch number into a computer which for all they know could program the chip in a manner completely independent of the and value they be feed into the system
