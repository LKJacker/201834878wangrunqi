from pmetzger perry e metzger subject the escrow database here be a disturb think now we no longer live in the day of big file cabinet we live in the electronic age i ask myself how big could the escrow database get how hard might it be to steal the whole thing particularly be i an nsa official operate with the tacit permission of the escrow house we can pretend that such will not happen but that naive well let see ten byte of each escrow half let asume ten byte of serial number in fact i believe the serial number be smaller but thi be an order of magnitude calculation we assume a the population and that each person ha a key i get five gigabyte for each of the two escrow databasis fit conveniently on a single very valuable exabyte tape thi can only get easier with time but who care i can already hold all the clipper key in the country in my pocket on two tape admittely they will think of safeguard they wo put the whole database on one disk prehap maybe they will throw stumble block in the way thi change nothing they key will be need every day by hundred if not thousand of law enforcement type so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval at some point with or without collusion by the agency those exabyte tape be go to get cut dorothy denning and david sternlight will doubtles claim thi ca happen but we know that ca be a prayer not a word that in thi instance connote realism with two exabyte tape in ymy pocket you would hold the key for every person conversation in the country in ymy hand yeah you need the master key two but that just ten byte of information that have to be store an awful lot of place come to think of it even if the nsa get a copy of the database be a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political view consider foreign intelligence service you know the one that david sternlight want to protect u from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do the french apparently do have a big spy operation in friendly country to get industrial secret so he be be completely irrational here although why my company could use cryptosystem without back door be leave unexplained by those that point out thi threat presumably foreign intelligence service can get mole into the nsa and other agency we have proof by example of thi it happen many time presumably someday they will get their hand on some fraction of the key you ca avoid that sort of thing do pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hand on the escrow databasis we crypto type be all teach something very important at the begin of intro to cryptography security must depend on the easily change key that you pick to run ymy system and not on a secret the escrow databasis be the sort of secret that my teacher tell u about but they be the sort of big secret they would lump into thi category imagine try to replace million clipper chip i can not believe that the nsa or whomever it be that do thi do realize all thi already they be too smart there be too many of them who have make their bone in the real world i suspect that they know precisely what they be do and that what they be do be give u the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography i suspect that they realize that they ca put thing off forever but they can try to delay thing a long a possible who know maybe even some of the higher up the inevitable bureaucratic type that rise in any organization really do believe that thi scheme might give person some security even a their subordinate in fort meade wring their hand over the foolishnes of it all perry metzger pmetzger laissez faire laissez passer le monde va de lui meme
