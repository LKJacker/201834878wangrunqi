from mvanheyn marc vanheyningen subject ripem frequently asked question archive-name last-update mar about thi posting thi be a list of likely question and information about ripem a program for public key mail encryption it thi faq not ripem wa write and will be maintain by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn it will be post to a variety of newsgroup on a monthly basi follow-up discussion specific to ripem be redirect to the group what new i be now run a world wide web archive of ripem information it do not contain much of anything that be available elsewhere but it ha convenient pointer to the most current version of thi faq and some other stuff the url be http thi month version ha a fair amount of new pointer to information on patent and stuff like that i also reorder a few thing to have a more sensible order i hope i do have to edit thi again soon disclaimer nothing in thi faq should be consider legal advice or anything other than one layperson opinion if you want real legal advice talk to a real lawyer preferably one with experience in patent law export regulation or whatever area of law be in question list of question what be ripem how can i get ripem will ripem run on my machine will ripem work with my mailer what be rsa what be de what be a fingerprint like what be pem what thi about distribute and authenticate key is it a bad idea to use patent algorithm in standard like pem what about why do all ripem public key look very similar what be pgp what about rpem what be mime what be i have thi simple way to defeat the security of ripem question and answer what be ripem ripem be a not yet complete but useful implementation of privacy enhanced mail pem ripem allow ymy electronic mail to have the fmy security facility provide by pem disclosure protection optional originator authenticity message integrity measure and non-repudiation of origin alway see what be pem ripem wa write primarily by mark riordan mrr most of the code be in the public domain except for the rsa routine which be a library call rsaref license from rsa datum security inc the current version of ripem be the current version of the macintosh port of ripem be how can i get ripem ripem use the library of cryptographic routine rsaref which be consider munition and thu be export-restricted from distribution to person who be not citizen or permanent resident in the or canada without an export license no such license ha be obtain nor would one likely be grant unles the rsa key exchange be shorten to bite and the symmetric cipher change to something weaker than de there be some suggestion that thi situation may change now that clinton be in office the author request in the readme file that thi law not be violate please do not export the cryptographic code in thi distribution outside of the usa or canada thi be a personal request from me the author of ripem and a condition of ymy use of ripem note that rsaref be not in the public domain and a license for it be include with the distribution you should read it before use ripem ripem be available vium anonymou ftp to citizen and permanent resident in the from cd to rsaref and read the readme file for info note that the non-rsaref portion of ripem be not a product of rsa datum security incorporated they merely be help distribute it ripem a well a some other crypt stuff ha it home site on which be open to non-anonymou ftp for user in the and canada who be citizen or permanent resident to find out how to obtain acces ftp there cd to and read the file for convenience binary for many architecture be available here in addition to the full source tree will ripem run on my machine probably it ha already be port to ms-do and most flavor of unix suno next linux aix ultrix solari etc port to macintosh include a standard unix-style port and a rather nice mac-like port write by raymond lau author of stuffit more port be expect and help of user be invite will ripem work with my mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface be will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though the user guide include with the distribution discus way to use ripem with many popular mailer include berkeley mush elm and mh code be also include in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu emac if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe be convenient to use secure and may be useful to other feel free to post it to what be rsa rsa be a crypto system which be asymmetric or public-key thi mean that there be two different relate key one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one can not reasonably be derive from the other you may publish ymy encryption or public key widely and keep ymy decryption or private key to yourself anyone can use ymy public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key need to decrypt it note that the message send with rsa be normally just the de key to the real plaintext see what be de note that the above only provide for disclosure protection for originator authenticity message integrity and non-repudiation of origin service to be implement the fingerprint of the message see what be a fingerprint like be encrypt with the sender private key the recipient or a dispute-resolving authority can use the sender public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and wa not alter rsa wa name for the three man rivest shamir and adleman who invent it to find out lot more about rsa and modern cryptography in general ftp to and look in some information also may be in what be de de be the datum encryption standard a widely use symmetric or secret-key crypto system unlike rsa de use the same key to encrypt and decrypt message however de be much faster than rsa ripem use both de and rsa it generate a random key and encrypt ymy mail with de use that key it then encrypt that key with the recipient public rsa key and include the result in the letter allow the recipient to recover the de key de be sometime consider weak because it be somewhat old and use a key length consider too short by modern standard however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it be not likely that the pem standard will incorporate support for other symmetric cipher in the near future because there be a strong feel that pem should be stable so it can become utilize widely without early problem with interoperability what be a fingerprint like be a message digest algorithm produce by rsa datum security inc it provide a fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it be cryptographically secure because it be not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produce the same fingerprint thu instead of sign the entire message with the sender private key only the of the message need to be sign for authentication can also be exchange directly for authentication for example ripem public key include an of the public key in the file so party wish to confirm their key be authentic vium a separate channel merely need exchange of key and verify their accuracy be sometime use for other purpose for example it be often use to map an input of arbitrary length to bite of datum a a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator be describe in it entirety include an implementation in c in rfc there have be some recent suggestion that may not be a strong a hash a wa originally believe presumably some other hash function will be use if thi be accept a true what be pem pem be privacy enhanced mail a standard for allow transfer of encrypt electronic mail generate over a long period of time by a work group of expert it be describe in rfc these document have be approve and obsolete the old rfc ripem be not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specify certificate for authenticate key which ripem do not handle at thi time their addition be plan what thi about distribute and authenticate key for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know ymy public key for you to be able to confirm that the message receive come from her you must know her public key it be important that thi information be accurate if a bad guy convince her that hi key be in fact your she will send message which he can read ripem allow for three method of key management a central server the distribute finger server and a flat file all three be describe in the ripem user guide which be part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security the pem standard call for key management by certificate the addition of thi feature to ripem be plan but chicken-egg issue still exist is it a bad idea to use patent algorithm in standard like pem thi issue ha be consider in the standard proces rfc the specification for internet standard ha a discussion section on what specification for nondiscriminatory availability must be meet for a patent method to be include in a standard rfc address thi issue with regard to the patent cover public-key cryptography thi do not of course mean that all question be settle or that everyone be in agreement an interest exchange on the use of patent algorithm in standard with regard to public-key cryptography be in the league for programming freedom archive available vium ftp in the file and amusingly the lpf file on be compress with a patent algorithm what about rsa datum security inc rsadsi be a california-based company specialize in cryptographic technology public key partner be a firm which hold exclusive sub-licensing right of the follow patent and all of their correspond foreign patent cryptographic apparatu and method diffie-hellman no public key cryptographic apparatu and method hellman-merkle no cryptographic communication system and method rsa no exponential cryptographic apparatu and method hellman-pohlig no pkp claim these fmy patent cover all know method of public key cryptography the two business be rather closely relate for example the same person jim bidzo be president of both of them pkp ha license thi technology to a considerable number of company ibm dec motorola at t lotu for use in their product pkp ha also threaten and file lawsuit defend their patent ripem wa originally create with no connection to rsadsi other than it use of the rsaref library and for no reason other than it author desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography however after the ball start roll person at rsadsi get interest rsadsi decide to carry ripem on it ftp site and some person there start make their own ripem key and contribute code ripem even win the best application built on rsaref in award why do all ripem public key look very similar ripem public key begin with a pkc public-key cryptography standard identifier describe variou characteristic about the key so the first bunch of character in ymy key may be the same a those of lot of other person key thi do not mean ymy key be similar but only that they be the same clas of key be generate with the same program be of the same length etc what be pgp pgp be another cryptographic mail program call pretty good privacy pgp ha be around longer than ripem and work somewhat differently pgp be not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp do also use rsa a few major difference between pgp and ripem pgp ha more key management feature particularly for user without a direct network connection ripem conform to the pem rfc and thu ha a greater probability of work with other pem software pgp make no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself ripem use rsaref a library of rsa routine from rsadsi which come with a license allow noncommercial use pgp use it own implementation of rsa pkp claim that it be a violation of it patent to make use or sell pgp in the or canada without either a license or write permission see disclaimer see what about phil zimmermann the author of pgp stop distribute it after be threaten with legal action he believe that a license scheme could be arrange but it ha happen and there seem little prospect of it happen in the future he acknowledge in the pgp user guide in fact if you live in the usa and you be not a federal agency you should actually run pgp on ymy computer because public key partner want to forbid you from run my software pgp be contraband both pgp and ripem be export-restricted and can not be send outside the and canada without an export license however pgp already exist on many ftp site in europe and other place whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp be recommend read to anyone interest in such issue unfortunately it not distribute separately from the program which can be difficult to find in the on ftp site due to liability concern what about rpem rpem stand for rabin privacy enhanced mail it wa similar to ripem but use a public-key cipher invent by rabin which be not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patent on public-key system it wa write by mark riordan who later write ripem it distribution wa halt when contrary to the belief of many include rabin pkp claim that their patent be broad enough to cover the cipher employ thi claim be not universally accept but wa not challenge for pragmatic reason rpem be not really use anymore it be not compatible with ripem or pgp what be mime mime stand for multipurpose internet mail extension and be describe in rfc you can find out about it in the newsgroup a faq exist on it how pem should interact with mime be not yet entirely clear some person use the stopgap solution of have a mime type in order to send ripem message a mime one i hope some standard will emerge draft internet document exist on the matter what be trusted information system be work on a version of privacy enhanced mail for general availability last i hear it wa rumor to be integrate into an exist mail user agent mh rather than a stand-alone system and in betum test i do know much more than that i have thi simple way to defeat the security of ripem you may wish to check the companion post ripem-attack which discus some of the more obviou attack on ripem security and what procedure will minimize the risk ripem main weak area be probably key distribution
