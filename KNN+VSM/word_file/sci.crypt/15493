from mrr mark riordan subject list of large integer arithmetic package thi be the file from last update april in response to email request i have assemble thi list of large-integer arithmetic package of which i have hear most of these be c function library available in source form for ymy convenience i have place copy of some of these on they be available for anonymou ftp in the directory however what i have may not be the most current version in all case here they be in no particular order mp multiple precision package that come with some unix multiple precision package access vium lmp flag on ymy compiler provide gcd exponentiation sqrt come with suno next mach bbn mach and probably a few other see man mp object code only of course parus henrus cohen et al universite bordeau i pari france multiple precision desk calculator and library routine contain optimize assembly code for motorola semi-optimized code for sparc and apparently rather slow generic c version do both integer and real do vector and matrix a well a scalar contain a number of advance function some of which i never hear of weber function ha a factorization function primality test other relate stuff plenty of tex documentation public domain but you ca distribute modify version available vium anonymou ftp from there seem to be mac and next-specific version there in addition to filename arithmetic in global field arith kevin r coombe david r grant package of routine for arbitrary precision integer or polynomial over finite field include basic and a few other like gcd source code in c distributed under the term of the gnu public license include man page and tex documentation filename arbitrary precision math library lloyd zusman lo gato ca c package which support basic provide for radix point non-integer not a polish a the other here posted to in october filename bignum j vuillemin inrium france and other distributed by digital equipment pari research lab decprl a portable and efficient arbitrary-precision integer package c code with generic c kernel plu assembly kernel for intel mip pyramid and of course vax thi be probably one of the better-known package of thi type implement mod plu logical operation or and xor both sign and unsigned arithmetic available available vium email from librarian you will receive shell archive give ymy postal addres and you will also receive print documentation from france package include tex documentation publicly available for non-commercial use i remove thi from my archive when i hear a rumor that prl do like other to distribute it however bignum be distribute a part of ecpp see below lenstra package arjen lenstra bellcore portable unsigned integer package write entirely in c include exponentiation mod primality test sqrt random number generator and a few other the package wa uncommented and undocumented i have try to add enough comment to get by thi be the only of these package that i have actually use it work well and be very portable i have do any benchmark against the other but the code look clever lenstra be an accomplish number theorist unlike the other package here thi one require you to allocate storage statically only a problem if ymy number be really huge arjen ha place the code in the public domain filename arjen lenstra bellcore an improve version of arjen package above thi one do sign arithmetic and dynamic allocation which can be turn off a an option ha a few new routine too contain minor bugfix to the previously-available and filename bmp brent multiple precision r p brent vintage fortran code to do extend precision float fix point arithmetic include most of the mathematical function you find in a fortran run-time library thi code be an acm algorithm number to obtain send a mail message to netlib contain the line send from bmp or better yet perhap just start with help spx kannan alagappan joseph tardo dec thi be a huge prototype public key authentication system base on rsa i mention it here because those who have hear of spx have probably correctly guess that it contain a large integer package and i want to inform you that the large integer package it contain be indeed dec bignum from france you can get a betum test copy of spx from use it only for test a it may expire on a certain date i do know whether thi ha expire yet amp anttus multiple precision anttus louko alo multiple precision integer package in c include pow mod mod y random sqrt gcd available for non-commercial use the package include share-secret a public key system base on the diffie-hellman algorithm thi be normally part of the well-known but i have remove the de part to avoid have to deal with cryptographic export law and have name the result filename gennum per bothner u of wisconsin-madison c routine and class to do generic arithmetic both integer and rational formerly available on however it seem to have disappear sorry miracl by someone in dublin ireland integer and fractional multiple precision package include factorization primality test encryption not public domain apparently it be available from the austin code work see ad in byte magazine or dr dobb precision dave barrett barrettd multiple precision integer package in c with sqrt rand mod pow log simple vector support do dynamic allocation of memory free a long a you do sell it or any program that use it filename ubasic prof yuji kida rikkyo university nishi-ikebukuro tokyo japan kida multiple-precision version of the basic program language for ms-do include float point said by keith brigg to be pretty fast object only i think ervin say thi be the best package that i know of for fast arithmetic ha a version optimize for machine include routine to do mpq the fastest currently know general factor algorithm an additional file be at both site to allow mpq to use hard drife so that it can factor up to digit many number theoretical function be include in ubasic it allow over digit of precision available vium anonymou ftp from or or unknown ms-do c-like language that allow infinite precision nice intrinsic function ervin report problem when change precision on the fly see or wuarchive keith brigg kbrigg turbo pascal source for routine that do multiple-precision sqrt gcd factor rand for integer also include and rand for rational number filename institute fur experimentelle mathematik dr gerhard schneider fast c multiple-precision subroutine library i do know anything about it say to contact for more info postal addres institute fur experimentelle mathematik ellernstr germany longint marku mueller mueller multus precision arithmetic write in with the most time critical part write in assembler include basic arithmetic a well a arithmetic modulo a number an additional module provide a collection of procedure for primality test gcd multiplicative inverse and more the package be part of a privacy enhanced mail pem package which include a pem mailer rsa key generator and certificate generation tool source be in c and assembler for sun longint ha also be port to ms-do under logitech and turbo assembler availability free for university use research and education otherwise a source license be require to obtain write or email to marku mueller bertastrasse dietikon switzerland email mueller bignum package write in portable c will in the future conform to the common lisp function that handle integer currently include exponentiation exptmod comparison random number and gcd filename gnu multiple precision gnu free software foundation multiple precision package i have look at it yet thi be current a of april but there may be a more recent version by the time you read thi thi package be very widely available on ftp site filename elliptic curve primality proving francoi morian france large package to prove the primality of any prime include inrium bignum package obtained from filename pgp pretty good privacy philip zimmermann prz intel-based crypto package that include bignum routine in c say to be quite fast for intel processor unix and mac version also available the crypto package violate rsa patent but the bignum routine can be use without fear of legal repercussion bell arbitrary precision calculator david i bell australium dbell arbitrary-precision calculator with good online help c-like language many builtin function support for integer rational number they work like float point complex number matrix string list file object include gcd primality test even trig function recommended large package though obtained from filename built-in support in other language variou multiple precision arithmetic be available in a number of program language such a lisp and abc cf perl by larry wall available from include source in perl for such a package but it probably not suitable for seriou use for some of these source code may be available thi list be long enough so i not go to pursue it aggressively thank to ed vielmettus and several other who contribute to thi list mark riordan mrr
