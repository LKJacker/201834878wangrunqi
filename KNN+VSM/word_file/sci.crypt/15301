from hal hal finney subject re how do it really work wa re text of white house announcement and q a on clipper chip encryption marc vanheyningen mvanheyn write the main thing i just do get be whether thi chip implement symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic technique anybody know i do know but i a will to speculate a anyone several person have suggest that the chip use public-key cryptography another possibility be to use diffie-hellman key exchange or some other algorithm which ha a similar effect dh allow both end to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography something like de for the encryption how could the back door key work in thi system i can see a few possibility one be that the dh-like algorithm ha the property that the session key can be deduce by an eavesdropper who know the back door key for one or possibly both communicant perhap the random number use in the dh be seed by the back door key or some such another possibility a wa suggest here earlier be that the chip simply broadcast the session key encrypt with the chip own internal secret key in thi system the back door key be secret key usable for decrypt thi session key broadcast actually the chip secret key do need to be a public key in thi usage but can be identical to the secret back-door key thi proposal seem most straightforward to me still another possibility be that the encryption algorithm use for the message itself ha a dual key property that possession of either of two key can be use to decrypt it one key would be the session key from the dh exchange and the other would be the back door key for the chip it worth note that one of the proposal dorothy denning raise during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last november and december wa a variation on diffie-hellman in which a third party would participate in derive the session key thi do quite fit into what we know of how clipper work but it hint that those who have early knowledge of clipper or whose think wa somehow synchronize with clipper designer may have have diffie-hellman on their mind hal finney
