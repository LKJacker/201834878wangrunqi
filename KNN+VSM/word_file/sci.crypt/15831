from dougb doug bank subject re revised technical summary of clipper chip in article denning write the chip be program by mykotronx inc which call them the the silicon be supply by vlsi technology inc they be implement in micron technology and will initially sell for about each in quantity of or more the price should drop a the technology be shrink to micron hmmmmmm seem a bite expensive how big be the chip what kind of package will be use volt or volt technology how much current will it draw i think there be many practical question that have be answer especially since thi chip already exist all clipper chip be program inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which be essentially a vault the scif contain a laptop computer and equipment to program the chip about chip be program during a single session the scif be locate at mykotronx at the begin of a session a trust agent from each of the two key escrow agency enter the vault agent enter a secret random value into the laptop and agent enter a secret random value these random value serve a seed to generate unit key for a sequence of serial number thu the unit key be a function of secret random bite where each agent know only ok i get a big problem with all of thi how in the world do you expect to sell these chip for even after all the overhead involve in thi program procedure person a laptop only chip at a time give me a break and how long do all of thi take even if it be a minute per chip it will take the greater part of a day to turn out of these thing how long do you suppose it will take to program those chip mention above thi be highly impractical to see how the chip be use imagine that it be embed in the at t telephone security device a it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after push a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an session key k with the device at the other end so where can i find info on thi at t device what kind of vocoder do it use do it require isdn phone line if not be it full duplex how do it sound what kind of synchronization scheme be use will all other little black box have to conform to at t choice of protocol etc will anybody else be allow to build box that conform to these specification doug bank private system division dougb motorola communication sector dougb schaumburg illinoi dougb
