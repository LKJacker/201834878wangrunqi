from pat pat myrto subject new clipper chip proposal from the guv i saw thi article post in a local newsgroup i have see it or any followup traffic relate to it in these group or other group which i subscribe to so i be post it here so other can read it check it out and comment on it and provide idea for handle these sort of thing i have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of thi article but if accurate i find it extremely disturb especially in light of variou bus of the ssn number regard privacy i understand it be now to be require in ca to renew a driver license or to register a car and other proposal regard national identity card wiretap proposal and such one simply wonder what other gem be in the wing ready to be spring on the person by my government perhap suggestion and idea for prevent thi and other such proposal from acquire the force of law would be useful the cost simply outweigh any possible benefit imo btw read thi make me think of some idea a prof denning ha be promote in an even more disturb form that say with no further comment the article follow begin include article note thi file will also be available vium anonymou file transfer from in directory and vium the nist computer security bb at the white house office of the pres secretary for immediate release april statement by the pres secretary the president today announce a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communication while meet the legitimate need of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new product to accelerate the development and use of advance and secure telecommunication network and wireles communication link for too long there ha be little or no dialogue between my private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenge of protect american rather than use technology to accommodate the sometime compete interest of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previou policy have pit government against industry and the right of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology ha be use for year to protect electronic fund transfer it be now be use to protect electronic mail and computer file while encryption technology can help american protect busines secret and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be use by terrorist drug dealer and other criminal a state-of-the-art microcircuit call the clipper chip ha be develop by government engineer the chip represent a new approach to encryption technology it can be use in new relatively inexpensive encryption device that can be attach to an ordinary telephone it scramble telephone communication use an encryption algorithm that be more powerful than many in commercial use today thi new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of datum transmit electronically at the same time thi technology preserve the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agency to intercept lawfully the phone conversation of criminal a key-escrow system will be establish to ensure that the clipper chip be use to protect the privacy of law-abiding american each device contain the chip will have two unique key number that will be need by authorize government agency to decode message encode by the device when the device be manufacture the two key will be deposit separately in two key-escrow datum basis that will be establish by the attorney general acces to these key will be limit to government official with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to acces the content of the private conversation of american to demonstrate the effectivenes of thi new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new device in addition respect expert from outside the government will be offer acces to the confidential detail of the algorithm to ass it capability and publicly report their find the chip be an important step in address the problem of encryption dual-edge sword encryption help to protect the privacy of individual and industry but it also can shield criminal and terrorist we need the clipper chip and other approach that can both provide law-abiding citizen with acces to the encryption they need and prevent criminal from use it to hide their illegal activity in order to ass technology trend and explore new approach like the key-escrow system the president ha direct government agency to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodate the privacy of my citizen include the need to employ voice or datum encryption for busines purpose the ability of authorize official to acces telephone call and datum under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect my citizen the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure need to promote economic growth and the competitivenes of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of company to manufacture and export high technology product the president ha direct early and frequent consultation with affect industry the congres and group that advocate the privacy right of individual a policy option be develop the administration be commit to work with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunication and computer technology to give american unprecedented acces to information thi infrastructure of high-speed network information superhighway will transmit video image hdtv program and huge datum file a easily a today telephone system transmit voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy regard it use the administration be commit to policy that protect all american right to privacy while also protect them from those who break the law further information be provide in an accompany fact sheet the provision of the president directive to acquire the new encryption technology be also available for additional detail call mat heyman national institute of standard and technology question and answer about the clinton administration telecommunication initiative q do thi approach expand the authority of government agency to listen in on phone conversation a no clipper chip technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to acces the content of the private conversation of american q suppose a law enforcement agency be conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggle ring and intercept a conversation encrypt use the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of thi authorization to the two entity responsible for safeguard the key and obtain the key for the device be use by the drug smuggler the key be split into two part which be store separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow datum bank a the two key-escrow datum bank will be run by two independent entity at thi point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agency will oversee the key-escrow datum bank q how strong be the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security be a thi system be more secure than many other voice encryption system readily available today while the algorithm will remain classify to protect the security of the key escrow system we be will to invite an independent panel of cryptography expert to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential user that there be no unrecognized vulnerability q whose decision wa it to propose thi product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agency be involve in thi decision thi approach ha be endorse by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet official q who wa consult the congres industry a we have on-going discussion with congres and industry on encryption issue and expect those discussion to intensify a we carry out my review of encryption policy we have brief member of congres and industry leader on the decision relate to thi initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturer a the government design and develop the key acces encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product manufacturer product manufacturer can acquire the microcircuit from the chip manufacturer that produce them q who provide the clipper chip a mykotronx program it at their facility in torrance californium and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturer the program function could be license to other vendor in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption device a we expect several manufacturer to consider incorporate the clipper chip into their device q if the administration be unable to find a technological solution like the one propose would the administration be will to use legal remedy to restrict acces to more powerful encryption device a thi be a fundamental policy question which will be consider during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide american with an encryption product that be more secure more convenient and le expensive than other readily available today but it be just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration be develop the administration be not say since encryption threaten the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright a some country have effectively do nor be the say that every american a a matter of right be entitle to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there be a false tension create in the assessment that thi issue be an either-or proposition rather both concern can be and in fact be harmoniously balance through a reason balance approach such a be propose with the clipper chip and similar encryption technique q what do thi decision indicate about how the clinton administration policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicate that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunication and compute and be commit to work with industry and public-interest group to find innovative way to protect american privacy help business to compete and ensure that law enforcement agency have the tool they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the device be exportable will other device that use the government hardware a voice encryption device be subject to export control requirement case-by-case review for each export be require to ensure appropriate use of these device the same be true for other encryption device one of the attraction of thi technology be the protection it can give to company operate at home and abroad with thi in mind we expect export license will be grant on a case-by-case basi for company seek to use these device to secure their own communication abroad we plan to review the possibility of permit wider exportability of these product end include article pat without prejudice ucc pat myrto seattle wa if all else fail try uunet pilchuck rwing pat wisdom only two thing be infinite the
