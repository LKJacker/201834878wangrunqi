from hanson robin hanson subject estimating wiretap would wiretap chip be cost-effective by robin hanson draft april summary compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollar wiretap be only worth two cent a month to polouse so the propose wiretap chip must raise phone cost by le than one part in three thousand to be cost-effective background until now phone have happen to allow the existence of wiretap detector which could pick up conversation on a phone line and over time law enforcement agency have come to rely on thi capability to aid in criminal investigation however powerful new encryption technology threaten thi statu quo by make possible truly private communication a small chip in each phone could soon make it literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical microphone at either end in order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agency to tap phone conversation the government announce on april that it have develop and begin manufacture a special wiretap chip to be place in future phone instead of the total privacy chip which have be under private development the same day at t announce it would use these chip in all it secure telephone product each chip would be create under government supervision when it would be give a fix indentifier and encryption key periodically during each conversation the chip would broadcast it identifier and other info in a special law enforcement block law enforcement officer with a court order could then obtain the key correspond to the indentifier from special trust agency and could thereby listen in on any future or previously record conversation on that phone to date most concern voice about thi plan have be about it security the government wo disclose the encryption algorithm and many suspect the government will not limit it acces in the way it ha claim the track record of previou government do not inspire confidence on thi point however thi paper will neglect these concern and ask instead whether thi new wiretap chip be a cost-effective tool for polouse investigation that be which be a cheaper way for society to investigate crime force phone communication to support wiretap or give polouse agency more money to investigate crime in other way or to put it another way would polouse agency be will to pay for each wiretap if they have to pay their share of the full social cost of force phone to support wiretap to start to answer thi question we might compare the current benefit wiretap provide to law enforcement agency with project cost of implement the new wiretap chip plan and since current benefit be easier to estimate we begin there wiretap benefit be the latest year for which wiretap statistic be available in that year wiretap installation be request and no request be deny thi figure do not include wiretap obtain with the consent of a party to the conversation arrest result from wiretap start the same year arrest come from wiretap in previou year and of arrest lead to conviction of the wiretap be for phone v pager email etc be regard drug offense and be request by federal authority each wiretap installation hear an average of call of them incriminate among person and cost an average of extrapolate from the installation report cost mostly for labor thu a total of about million wa spend on wiretap to obtain about arrest at per arrest thu these arrest be at least fmy time more expensive than the per arrest figure one get by divide the billion spend by all polouse nationally by the total million non-traffic arrest thu the million per year spend on phone tap be only one thousanth of the total polouse expenditure and if we divide thi by the million phone acces line in the country we get about cent spend per year per phone line or about two cent a month in general we deter a give clas of criminal through a combination of a perceive probability of be catch and convict and some expect punishment level if convict so the social value of have wiretap be no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get the same criminal deterrence through other mean if unable to wiretap a particular suspect phone polouse might instead use hide microphone or investigate that suspect in other way or polouse might focu on suspect more easily investigate without wiretap or we might raise the fine or prison time for certain type of crime if we generously assume that these substitute for wiretap would be on average twice a expensive a wiretap then the annual social benefit of phone wiretap be about equal to the current spend level of two cent a month per phone line wiretap cost let u for the moment optimistically assume that the u government encryption scheme be a secure a whatever private enterprise would have offer instead protect my conversation from the spy ear of neighbor corporation and government both foreign and domestic even so the need to support wiretap would add many additional cost to build and maintain my communication system extra law enforcement block would be add to phone transmission increase traffic by some unknown percentage a special proces must be use to add encryption key to chip while securely distribute these key to special agency which must be fund and monitor the chip themself be design by a military contractor whose design be to remain secret and be manufacture through a special proces so that the chip become nearly impossible to take apart chip be now offer at the relatively high price of a peice in lot of private encryption system not support wiretap would require none of these extra cost perhap most important government degree would at least partially replace private marketplace evolution of standard for how voice be to be represent encrypt and exchange in my future phone it be widely believe that government be le efficient than private enterprise in procure product and standard though they may perhap perform a useful broker role when we choose between compete private standard how much le efficient be a matter of debate some say they pay twice a much while other might say only more currently a total of billion be spend a operate expense of phone company which come out to about per month per acces line if we compare thi to the wiretap value of two cent per month we see that if wiretap raise average operate cost by even a much a one part in then wiretap be not cost effective and thi do even include extra cost phone owner pay because their encryption chip be more expensive of course most phone would have encryption chip for a while but the wiretap benefit per phone be still the same so thi argument still apply conclusion given thi dramatic difference between the total cost of run the phone system and the value of wiretap we can justify only the slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretap when the only modification require wa to allow investigator in to attach clip to phone wire wiretap support may have be reasonable but when we consider substantial modification the burden of proof be clearly on those propose such modification to show that the cost would really be le than the benefit if consensu can not be obtain on thi estimate a compromise might be to tax phone which do not support wiretap at a rate of say five cent per month a tax payable to polouse agency nationwide to compensate them for their los of wiretap ability the invisible weapon oxford pres isbn report on application for order authorizing or approving the interception of wire oral or electronic communication
