from smb steven bellovin subject clipper some new think i desparately prefer it if we do rehash the same argument that go on ad infinitum last time that especially true for for that matter i create since the traffic be appear in many different group right now i go to focu here on some technical aspect of the plan hence my followup to frankly if you not an absolutist ymy feel may turn on some of these issue for example with an key simply split it into two piece be much le acceptable than other scheme because it mean that if just one repository be shall we say overly pliable a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just more bite of key i need not point out in thi newsgroup that that pretty easy to do by exhaustive search a slightly more complex scheme xor-ing the key with a random number and then with it complement would produce two subkey neither of which be useful alone that variant be much more resistant to attack clearly one can get even more sophisticate to protect the subkey even more other think some person have note the size and complexity of the databasis necessary but the id string the phone emit could be their back door key double-encrypted with the escrow repository public key for that matter they could do that only with session key and have no back door at all in that case the fbi would have to bring every intercept to the repository to be decrypt thi would answer many of the objection along the line of how do you make sure they stop we can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door have the switch do the tap but with a digitally-signed record of the time phone number etc of the call that provide proof to the escrow agent that the tap wa do in compliance with the term of the warrant i can suggest other variation too suppose each clipper chip have public key pair each would be use time after which you need more key material not a bad idea in any event thi could be use to enforce time limit or rather usage limit on each warrant the key the repository agent would deliver would last for very long i suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself be secure apart from the obviou why push a weak algorithm when you already get the back door i think that the government be still genuinely concern about foreign espionage especially aim at commercial target thi scheme let the spook have their cake and eat it too i hear rumor over the year that some faction within nsa be unhappy with de because it wa too good not that they could crack it but it wa much too expensive to do so a easily a they want they keep the detail secret so that other do build their own implementation without the back door the cryptographic protocol though be another matter i see no valid reason for keep it secret and a i hope i show above there be a lot of way to do thing that be quite a bad
