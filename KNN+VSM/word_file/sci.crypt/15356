from johnl john r levine subject why the clipper algorithm be secret the cryptographic protocol though be another matter i see no valid reason for keep it secret and a i hope i show above there be a lot of way to do thing that be quite a bad it just occur to me why the algorithm be secret if it be publish one could then build physically identical clone version of the chip that would interoperate with official clipper chip but the cloner would provide the key to the escrow house hmmn or be there a technical hack that i miss how about if the chip be make unprogrammed but serialize and then ship to the two escrow house who program in their half of the key but in a way that require that secret key know only to the escrow house be instal a well without which clone version would interoperate thi be get awfully complicate but that crypto for you john r levine iecc pob cambridge ma johnl iecc johnl time be money steal some today
