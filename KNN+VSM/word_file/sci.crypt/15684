from koontzd david koontz subject re will fed troll for mutilate law enforcement block the m code stream might be independently attack base on knowledge of clipper chip protocol a reveal plaintext thi could be invalidate by change the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper m stream and the actual transmit stream under the control of a secure key generator synchronize between endpoint the useful life time of capture law enforcement block might be limit base on hostile force use them a target follow transmission interception you would need a large number of them but hey there suppose to be million of these thing right adding time stamp to the encrypt law enforcement block be probably impractical who want an encryption chip with a real time clock the entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidate i just have the think that you could capture ymy own law enforcement block for session key k that you will not use in actual transmission a the session key authenticator the proviso that you do mind ymy own serial number be discover d denning just send out further information of a new version of the clipper chip if a hash function be to be embed in a clipper m transmission block reflect the law enforcement block it better not fall on bite block boundary if it be a recognizeable datum you could lie with it too i like the randomizer inclusion in the i remember read that intel have an approve random noise source on silicon hence the ability to put it inside you ever think that mykotronx sound like one of those make up name of company use a front for intelligence organization
