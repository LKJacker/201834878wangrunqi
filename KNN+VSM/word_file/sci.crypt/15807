from artmel arthur melnick subject new encryption algorithm ever since craig rowland post hi piece new encryption to there ha be some discussion of my company secured communication technology inc and on encryption algorithm nea i speak to craig at length on and we cover a lot of grind some of the information in the post require some clarification and i would like to answer some of the question raise on sct be a small company base in silver spring maryland my two main product at thi time be a pc base secure communication program call secom and a general purpose encryption chip which use the nea algorithm develop for secom secom provide an encrypt secure communication link between two pc connect over dial up telephone line it support simultaneou bi-directional file transfer and keyboard to screen chat it ha it own proprietary communication protocol which be tightly integrate to the encryption all though it be a packetized link the datum stream appear to be continuou because the packet boundary be hide when secom wa initially develop it wa implement to use de encryption a busines decision wa make to seek export approval for the product because it wa perceive that the oversea market wa a large one and provide a good market opportunity we soon find out that we would never be grant general export approval for anything use de all though the reason for thi wa never explicitly state it seem to have something to do with secret government to government agreement which be still in effect in any event the decision wa make to develop a new and different algorithm which would take the place of de thi wa the reason nea new encryption algorithm wa bear at thi time nea be be hold a a trade secret the preliminary work of patent it ha begin and the plan be to make it public once the patent proces be complete all though one can make certain legal argument for keep it an ongoing secret i think in the case of an encryption algorithm it be necessary to let person shoot at it over an extend period of time to prove it worth in order to get export approval for it wa necessary to go through nsa and to reveal to them the detail of the program and algorithm thi wa do only after we have a finish product to submit let me state unequivocally that there be no back door to the program or the algorithm secured communication technology be a closely hold private company and ha no financial interest in any way whatsoever with the company or any of the person involve from a practical busines standpoint we be interest in sell chip and software hopefully in large quantity and a back door to the encryption if find out could destroy my credibility and my busines with the encryption algorithm approve for export we set out to talk to a number of potential customer for encryption product and system we be able to identify several common thread of functionality requirement thi lead to the design of a chip with the encryption algorithm cast in silicon and certain other capability add so that the chip could fulfill the broad range of requirement that we identify we be strongly oppose to the chip in a pres release today my president dr stephen bryen state it seem a if the government ha an unlimited source of fund to use to push it new bug chip on the american public but do we not understand how the national security agency which be not suppose to be involve in domestic spy can fund the development of a commercial chip intend to accommodate government domestic spy activity if they have ask me to put a back door in nea i would have tell them to g can nsa break nea or for that matter can they break de rsa idea diffy-hellman pgp or whatever i do know and probably never will
