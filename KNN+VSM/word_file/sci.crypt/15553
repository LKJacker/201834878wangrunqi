with roy copperud a retire professor journalism at the university of southern californium and the author of american usage and style the consensu a little research lend support to brocki opinion of professor copperud expertise roy copperud wa a newspaper writer on major daily for over three decade before embark on a a distinguish career teach journalism at usc since copperud ha be write a column deal with the professional aspect of journalism for editor and publisher a weekly magazine focus on the journalism field he on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary and merriam webster usage dictionary frequently cite him a an expert copperud fifth book on usage american usage and style the consensu ha be in continuou print from van nostrand reinhold since and be the winner of the association of american publisher humanity award that sound like an expert to me after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduce myself but do not give him any indication of why i wa interest i send the follow letter i be write you to ask you for ymy professional opinion a an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united state constitution and extract the intent from the text the text of the second amendment be well-regulated militium be necessary for the security of a free state the right of the person to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe the debate over thi amendment ha be whether the first part of the sentence well-regulated militium be necessary to the security of a free state be a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause contain the subject of the sentence right of the person to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe i would request that ymy analysi of thi sentence not take into consideration issue of political impact or public policy but be restrict entirely to a linguistic analysi of it mean and intent further since ymy professional analysi will likely become part of litigation regard the consequence of the second amendment i ask that whatever analysi you make be a professional opinion that you would be will to stand behind with ymy reputation and even be will to testify under oath to support if necessary my letter frame several question about the test of the second amendment then conclude i realize that i be ask you to take on a major responsibility and task with thi letter i be do so because a a citizen i believe it be vitally important to extract the actual mean of the second amendment while i ask that ymy analysi not be affect by the political importance of it result i ask that you do thi because of that importance after several more letter and phone call in which we discuss term for hi do such an analysi but in which we never discuss either of my opinion regard the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud send me the follow analysi into which i have insert my question for the sake of clarity copperud the word well-regulated militium be necessary to the security of a free state contrary to the interpretation cite in ymy letter of july constitute a present participle rather than a clause it be use a an adjective modify which be follow by the main clause of the sentence subject right verb the to keep and bear arm be assert a an essential for maintain a militium in reply to ymy number question schulman can the sentence be interpret to grant the right to keep and bear arm solely to well-regulated militium copperud the sentence do not restrict the right to keep and bear arm nor do it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by other than the person it simply make a positive statement with respect to a right of the person schulman is right of the person to keep and bear arm grant by the word of the second amendment or do the second amendment assume a preexist right of the person to keep and bear arm and merely state that such right not be infringe copperud the right be not grant by the amendment it existence be assume the thrust of the sentence be that the right shall be preserve inviolate for the sake of ensure a militium schulman is the right of the person to keep and bear arm condition upon whether or not a well regulate militium be in fact necessary to the security of a free state and if that condition be not exist be the statement right of the person to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe null and void copperud no such condition be express or imply the right to keep and bear arm be not say by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militium no condition be state or imply a to the relation of the right to keep and bear arm and to the necessity of a well-regulated militium a a requisite to the security of a free state the right to keep and bear arm be deem unconditional by the entire sentence schulman do the clause well-regulated militium be necessary to the security of a free state grant a right to the government to place condition on the of the person to keep and bear arm or be such right deem unconditional by the mean of the entire sentence copperud the right be assume to exist and to be unconditional a previously state it be invoke here specifically for the sake of the militium schulman which of the follow do the phrase militium mean or to regulation of a superior authority copperud the phrase mean to regulation of a superior authority thi accord with the desire of the writer for civilian control over the military schulman if at all possible i would ask you to take account the change mean of word or usage since that sentence wa write year ago but not take into account historical interpretation of the intent of the author unles those issue can be clearly separate copperud to the best of my knowledge there ha be no change in the mean of word or in usage that would affect the mean of the amendment if it be write today it might be put since a well-regulated militium be necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the person to keep and bear arm shall not be abridge schulman a a control on thi analysi i would also appreciate it if you could compare ymy analysi of the text of the second amendment to the follow sentence a well-schooled electorate be necessary to the security of a free state the right of the person to keep and read book shall not be infringe my question for the usage analysi of thi sentence would be is the grammatical structure and usage of thi sentence and the way the word modify each other identical to the second amendment sentence and could thi sentence be interpret to restrict right of the person to keep and read book only to well-educated electorate for example register voter with a high-school diploma copperud ymy control sentence precisely parallel the amendment in grammatical structure there be nothing in ymy sentence that either indicate or imply the possibility of a restrict interpretation professor copperud have only one additional comment which he place in hi cover letter with well-known human curiosity i make some speculative effort to decide how the material might be use but wa unable to reach any conclusion so now we have be tell by one of the top expert on american usage what many know all along the constitution of the united state unconditionally protect the person right to keep and bear arm forbid all government form under the constitution from abridge that right a i write thi the attempt coup against constitutional government in the soviet union ha fail apparently because the will of the person in that part of the world to be free from capriciou tyranny be stronger than the old guard desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power and here in the united state elect lawmaker judge and appoint official who be pledge to defend the constitution of the united state ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely american citizen be put in american prison for carry arm own arm of forbid sort or fail to satisfy bureaucratic requirement regard the own and carry of firearm all of which be an abridgement of the unconditional right of the person to keep and bear arm guarantee by the constitution and even the american civil liberty union aclu staunch defender of the rest of the bill of right stand by and do nothing it seem it be up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arm to preserve that right no one else will no one else can will we beg my elect representative not to take away my right and continue regard them a represent u if they do will we continue obey judge who decide that the second amendment do mean what it say it mean but mean whatever they say it mean in their orwellian doublespeak or will be simply keep and bear the arm of my choice a the constitution of the united state promise u we can and pledge that we will defend that promise with my life my fortuned and my sacred honor c by the new gun
