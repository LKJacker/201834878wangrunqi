generation and the escrow proces and how law enforcement decrypt communication interesting tell u what happen if i be to say ok i want to have something else if the law enforcement want my traffic they can record it then get a search warrant and get the key from me just like they would the key to a stout private safe etc let say i suspect that there be a way to trivially crack thi at the fed level with no warrant say for nsa scan for keyword etc and the government ha abuse great power in the past so i say mr vendor i want something different independent i be a paranoid sort ya understand will the result be sorry without government permission we can not sell you anything secure or would it be sorry we know which side my bread be butter on we can not sell except to government person law enforcement and person what in ymy opinion would be the chance of sure we will sell you thi secure system be happy to also please be so kind a to tell u what the plan be for private encryption of say file transfer by modem or ftp or datum store on disk surely you have a feel for what the administration be plan for u person on that with ymy rather intimate relationship with the fbi nsa etc you must certainly have an idea you be surely not go to say the person be not to know until it be too late thi is suppose to be government of the person by the person be it that be the person are the government boss the boss want to know what the be go on here you see i be kind of nervou because in the last month or so i have see a non-stop stream of idea come out of wash dc that at least appear very strongly to have a common trait to limit privacy freedom from govt eavesdrop and the ability to defend ourself against violent attack no be not good enough for folk they arrive only in time to clean up the me i would be dead if i have to depend on you see with all that talk about national smart id card limit of encryption to approve denial of mean to effective personal defense eight bill in congres right now it look an awfully lot like the whole thing be to be able to trace every activity of an individual from cradle to grave all it would take be require that national id card to be use in all transaction and with no effective datum protection and with the person suitably disarm there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it now would there all in the name of the war on the constitu er drug and of course that catch word what be wrong with good old-fashioned polouse work to build a case they do want to have to be burden to leave the office it seem please read the bill of right first ten amendment to the u constitution and tell u how you can reconcile thi big brother-ish policy of the administration alway for a of some kind be it with that bill of right in the context of the person who write it reassure u please or be that no longer regard a necessary see a apparantly the person have no input on thi agenda the administration prefer to make all the decision in secret then spring it on u do sound much like by the person to me i can not help notice that the congres person involve be not mention on the pres release i find that more than a little bite curiou do you i sure would like to know who to not vote for come election time ye i be upset i feel you be a part of thi because i recall it wa you that wa post heavily in favor of a very similar idea could have be the same thing it wa so close a few month ago i also recall it wa not well receive apparantly powers-that-be really do care or be not tell or both from what i see clipper will only be useful for conversation i do want the neighborhood kid listen in on any seriou security i do think i would want to trust it a bite might a well use cleartext certainly corporation would be rather dumb to depend on thi for seriou trade-secret datum especially if million depend on that security given enough money one could buy any key they want buy a crook judge and a crook cop given a few hundred thou they would be hard to find so we end up with only criminal terrorist and the government with real security and the ability to eavesdrop you know the first two if they be seriou ai go to use thi thing for their communication i bet the government wo either except perhap to order a pizza tell u will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity someone not use the approve method that just a desire to have privacy be no longer regard a a legitimate right of an unconnected citizen will that be grind for a fly-through-the-door raid and confiscation of all one equipment a tool use civil forfeiture so there will be no inconvenient need to prove any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen i have yet another question be we go to see article in all the public magazine consist of soothe text tell u how great thi be how nice the government be by letting u have thi illusion of privacy that the government be go to be so kind a to let u of exercise a right what you want to bet that i be correct here please answer these question a citizen of the united state we hava a right to know what my government plan to u have out of the goodnes of their heart funny thing though with all these proposal i do feel one bit safer from drug dealer terrorist or a common street thug i be begin to wonder if the greater danger ly in the above entity or my own government go out of control re-assure u please so far
