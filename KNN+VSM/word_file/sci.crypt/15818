from john kelsey subject pgp idea for ibm system i be think about how difficult it would be to make pgp available in some form on ebcdic machine the message authentication would be ugly but i think at least the idea encryption could work if pgp have a switch to tell it to use idea in ofb-mode or ecb-mode in ofb-mode error in translate ebcdic ascius ebcdic would only affect their byte not the byte that would be affect under cbc is pgp set up to use different idea mode i do recall notincing it in the executable but i have go through it a carefully a i probably should john kelsey
