from koontzd david koontz subject re new encryption from denning the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning revised april the chip be program by mykotronx inc which call them the the silicon be supply by vlsi technology inc all clipper chip be program inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which be essentially a vault the scif contain a laptop computer and equipment to program the chip about chip be program during a single session the scif be locate at mykotronx acknowledgment and distribution notice thi article be base on information provide by nsa nist fbi and mykotronx permission to distribute thi document be grant so who be mykotronx inc it would be nice to know that they be not a front company use by an intelligence or other agency of the government trusting the fox to guard the chicken and all that seem suspiciou when the rest of the source be fox while we be at it the chip design s should be examine and verify against silicon to insure no trap door or hide protocol exist in silicon regardles of the security level of the encryption algorithm it would be a shame if some three letter agency have the ability to interrogate my chip when all i know be that someone ring and when i attempt to go off hook the line go dead could be even worse if the chip be intend to connect directly to a modem the design examination should be do to the gate level do anyone have a good idea how to tell if there be a piggyback design on silicon the model would be extra logic share pin with the advertise function tip off would be circuitry that would ignore incoming datum if format or sequence be not right i can think of only two way an output pin could be use and it possible that might be notice but could be edit from the netlist i think the silicon itself need to be investigate imagine a design do in two layer metalization yet find a third layer under the microscope the government be ask for a lot of blind trust the encryption algorithm operate protocol the agency have physical control of the device the silicon implementation i feel like keep one hand on my wallet
