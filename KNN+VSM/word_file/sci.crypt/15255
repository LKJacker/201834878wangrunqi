from crypt-comment subject cryptography faq other miscellany archive-name last-modified faq for part other miscellany thi be the ninth of ten part of the faq the part be mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest we do have the time to send out miss part by mail so do ask note such a refer to the reference list in the last part the section of thi faq be available vium anonymou ftp to a xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroup and every day content what be the national security agency nsa what be the u export regulation what be tempest what be the beale cipher and be they a hoax what be the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch is rsa patent what about the voynich manuscript what be the national security agency nsa the nsa be the official security body of the government it wa give it charter by president truman in the late and ha continue research in cryptology till the present the nsa be know to be the largest employer of mathematician in the world and be also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world government in general have alway be prime employer of cryptologist the nsa probably posse cryptographic expertise many year ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the system use in practice but for reason of national security almost all information about the nsa be classify bamford book bamfd gife a history of the person and operation of the nsa the follow quote from massey highlight the difference between public and private research in cryptography if one regard cryptology a the prerogative of government one accept that most cryptologic research will be conduct behind close door without doubt the number of worker engage today in such secret research in cryptology far exceed that of those engage in open research in cryptology for only about year ha there in fact be widespread open research in cryptology there have be and will continue to be conflict between these two research community open research be common quest for knowledge that depend for it vitality on the open exchange of idea vium conference presentation and publication in scholarly journal but can a government agency charge with responsibility of break the cipher of other nation countenance the publication of a cipher that it can not break can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectivenes of hi own government code-breaker one might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would force all government to behave like stimson gentleman but one must be aware that open research in cryptography be fraught with political and ethical consideration of a severity than in most scientific field the wonder be not that some conflict have occur between government agency and open researcher in cryptology but rather that these conflict at least those of which we be aware have be so few and so mild what be the u export regulation in a nutshell there be two government agency which control export of encryption software one be the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce authorize by the export administration regulation ear another be the office of defense trade control dtc in the state department authorize by the international traffic in arm regulation itar a a rule of thumb bxa which work with cocom ha le stringent requirement but dtc which take order from nsa want to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa the newsgroup carry many interest discussion on the law surround cryptographic export what person think about those law and many other complex issue which go beyond the scope of technical group like make sure to consult ymy lawyer before do anything which will get you throw in jail if you be lucky ymy lawyer might know a lawyer who ha at least hear of the itar what be tempest tempest be a standard for electromagnetic shield for computer equipment it wa create in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation from a crt at quite a distance and with little effort needles to say encryption do do much good if the cleartext be available thi way what be the beale cipher and be they a hoax thank to jim gillogly for thi information and john king for correction the story in a pamphlet by j b ward go thoma jefferson beale and a party of adventurer accumulate a huge ma of treasure and bury it in bedford county virginium leave three cipher with an innkeeper the cipher describe the location content and intend beneficiary of the treasure ward gife a decryption of the second cipher content call it wa encrypt a a book cipher use the initial letter of the declaration of independence dous a key and be unsolved many document have be try a the key to aficionado can join a group that attempt to solve by variou mean with an eye toward split the treasure the beale cypher association box beaver fall pa you can get the cipher from the faql by include the line send index in a message to netlib and follow the direction there be apparently several different version of the cipher float around the correct version be base on the pamphlet say john king kingj some believe the story be a hoax kruh gife a long list of problem with the story gillogly decrypt with the dous and find some unexpected string include abfdefghiijklmmnohpp hammer president of the beale cypher association agree that thi string could appear by chance but feel there must be an explanation gwyn expert be unimpressed with thi string what be the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch the aca be an organization devote to cryptography with an emphasi on cryptanalysi of system that can be attack either with pencil-and-paper or computer it organ the cryptogram include article and challenge cipher among the more than cipher type in english and other language be simple substitution playfair vigenere bifid bazery grille homophonic and cryptarithm due be for one year issue more outside of north america le for student under and senior subscription should be send to aca treasurer west hickory st mundelein il is rsa patent ye the patent number be file grant for further discussion of thi patent whether it should have be grant algorithm patent in general and relate legal and moral issue see and for information about the league for programming freedom see ftppf note that one of the original purpose of wa to collect question such a should rsa be patent which often flood and other technical newsgroup into a more appropriate forum what about the voynich manuscript nelson nelson minar say there be a mail list on the subject the addres to write to subscribe to the vm mail list be voynich-request the ftp archive be there all sort of information about the manuscript itself of course a good bibliography can be find on the ftp site kahn the codebreaker gife a good introduction
