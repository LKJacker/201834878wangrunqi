from whitaker russell earl whitaker subject from crossbow to cryptography begin pgp signed message please note that the follow speech wa make by chuck hammill in addres all letter to hi addres give at the end of thi document russell from crossbow to cryptography thwarting the state vium technology given at the future of freedom conference november you know technology and particularly computer technology ha often get a bad rap in libertarian cir cle we tend to think of orwell or terry gilliam brazil or the proximity detector keep east berlin on their own side of the border or the so phisticated bug device nixon use to haras those on hi enemy list or we recognize that for the price of a ticket on the concorde we can fly at twice the speed of sound but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run by a government policeman and permit him to paw thru my be long if it beep but i think that mind-set be a mistake before there be cattle prod government torture their prisoner with club and rubber hose before there be laser for eavesdrop government use binocular and lip-reader though government certainly use technology to oppres the evil ly not in the tool but in the wielder of the tool in fact technology represent one of the most promi ing avenue available for re-capturing my freedom from those who have steal them by it very nature it favor the bright who can put it to use over the dull who can not it favor the adaptable who be quick to see the merit of the new over the sluggish who cling to time test way and what two better word be there to de scribe government bureaucracy than dull and sluggish one of the clearest classic triumph of technology over tyranny i see be the invention of the man-portable crossbow with it an untrained peasant could now reliably and lethally engage a target out to fifty meter even if that target be a mount chain-mailed knight unlike the longbow which admittedly wa more powerful and could get off more shoot per unit time the crossbow require no formal train to utilize wherea the longbow require elaborate visual tactile and kinesthetic coordination to achieve any degree of accuracy the wielder of a crossbow could simply put the weapon to hi shoulder sight along the arrow itself and be reasonably assure of hit hi tar get moreover since just about the only mount knight likely to visit ymy average peasant would be government soldier and tax collector the utility of the device wa plain with it the common rabble could defend themself not only against one another but against their governmental master it wa the medieval equivalent of the armor pierce bullet and consequently king and priest the medieval equivalent of a bureau of alcohol tobacco and crossbow threaten death and excommunication respec tively for it unlawful possession looking at later development we see how technology like the firearm particularly the repeat rifle and the handgun later follow by the gatling gun and more advance machine gun radically alter the balance of interpersonal and inter-group power not without reason wa the colt call the equalizer a frail dance-hall host with one in her possession wa now fully able to protect herself against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon advertise ment for the period also reflect the merchandise of the repeat cartridge rifle by declare that a man on horseback arm with one of these rifle simply can not be capture and a long a hi captor be rely upon flintlock or single-shot rifle the quote be doubtles a true one updating now to the present the public-key cipher with a personal computer to run it represent an equiv alent quantum leap in a defensive weapon not only can such a technique be use to protect sensitive datum in one own possession but it can also permit two stranger to ex change information over an insecure communication channel a wiretapped phone line for example or skywriting for that matter without ever have previously meet to exchange cipher key with a thousand-dollar com puter you can create a cipher that a multi-megabuck cray x-mp ca crack in a year within a few year it should be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi cation soon after that full-color digitize video image technology will not only have make wiretapping obsolete it will have totally demolish government control over in formation transfer i like to take just a moment to sketch the mathemat ic which make thi principle possible thi algorithm be call the rsa algorithm after rivest shamir and adleman who jointly create it it security derife from the fact that if a very large number be the product of two very large prime then it be extremely difficult to obtain the two prime factor from analysi of their product ex tremely in the sense that if prime p and q have digit apiece then their product can not in gen eral be factor in le than year by the most powerful computer now in existence the public part of the key consist of the prod uct pq of the two large prime p and q and one fac tor call it x of the product xy where xy the private part of the key consist of the other factor y each block of the text to be encrypt be first turn into an integer either by use ascius or even a simple representation thi integer be then raise to the power x modulo pq and the result integer be then send a the encrypt message the receiver decrypt by take thi integer to the secret power y modulo pq it can be show that thi proces will alway yield the original number start with what make thi a groundbreaking development and why it be call public-key cryptography be that i can openly publish the product pq and the number x while keep secret the number y so that anyone can send me an encrypt message namely x a mod pq but only i can recover the original message a by take what they send raise it to the power y and take the result mod pq the risky step meet to exchange cipher key ha be eliminate so person who may not even trust each other enough to want to meet may still reliably ex change encrypt message each party have select and disseminate hi own pq and hi x while maintain the secrecy of hi own y another benefit of thi scheme be the notion of a dig ital signature to enable one to authenticate the source of a give message normally if i want to send you a message i raise my plaintext a to ymy x and take the result mod ymy pq and send that however if in my message i take the plaintext a and raise it to my secret power y take the result mod my pq then raise that result to ymy x mod ymy pq and send thi then even after you have normally decrypt the message it will still look like garbage however if you then raise it to my public power x and take the result mod my public pq so you will not only recover the orus ginal plaintext message but you will know that no one but i could have send it to you since no one else know my secret y and these be the very concern by the way that be to day torment the soviet union about the whole question of personal computer on the one hand they recognize that american schoolchild be right now grow up with com puter a commonplace a sliderule use to be more so in fact because there be thing computer can do which will interest and instruct and and it be pre cisely these student who one generation hence will be go head-to-head against their soviet counterpart for the soviet to hold back might be a suicidal a continue to teach swordsmanship while ymy adversary be learn ballistic on the other hand whatever else a personal computer may be it be also an exquisitely efficient copy machine a floppy disk will hold upward of word of text and can be copy in a couple of minute if thi be threaten enough the computer that perform the copy can also encrypt the datum in a fashion that be all but unbreakable remember that in soviet society publicly ac cessible xerox machine be unknown the relatively few copy machine in existence be control more inten sively than machine gun be in the united state now the conservative position be that we should not sell these computer to the soviet because they could use them in weapon system the liberal position be that we should sell them in the interest of mutual trade and cooperation and anyway if we do make the sale there will certainly be some other nation will to for my part i ready to suggest that the libertarian position should be to give them to the soviet for free and if necessary make them take them and if that do work load up an blackbird and air drop them over moscow in the middle of the night paid for by private sub scription of course not taxation i confes that thi be not a position that ha gain much support among member of the conventional left-right political spectrum but af ter all in the word of one of illuminatu character we be political non-euclidean the shortest distance to a particular goal may not look anything like what most person would consider a straight line taking a long enough world-view it be arguable that break the soviet govern ment monopoly on information transfer could better lead to the enfeeblement and indeed to the ultimate dissolution of the soviet empire than would the production of another dozen missile aim at moscow but there the rub a long enough world view do suggest that the evil the oppressive the coercive and the simply stupid will get what they deserve but what not immediately clear be how the rest of u can escape be kill enslave or pauperize in the proces when the liberal and other collectivist begin to at tack freedom they possess a reasonably stable healthy function economy and almost unlimited time to proceed to hamstring and dismantle it a policy of political gradualism wa at least conceivable but now we have patchwork crazy-quilt economy hold together by bale wire and spit the state not only taxe u to fee the poor while also induce farmer to slaughter milk cow and drive up food price it then simultaneously turn around and sub sidize research into agricultural chemical design to in crease yield of milk from the cow leave alive or witnes the fact that a decline in the price of oil be consider a potentially frighten a a comparable increase a few year ago when the price go up we be tell the economy risk collapse for for want of energy the price increase wa call the moral equivalent of war and the fed swing into action for the first time in american history the speed at which you drive ymy car to work in the morning be come an issue of federal concern now when the price of oil drop again we risk problem thi time because amerus can oil company and third world basket-case nation who sell oil may not be able to ever pay their debt to my grossly over-extended bank the suggest panacea be that government should now re-raise the oil price that opec ha lower vium a new oil tax since the government be seek to raise oil price to about the same extent a opec do what can we call thi except the moral equivalent of civil war the government against it own person and classically in international trade can you imag ine any entity in the world except a government go to court claim that a vendor wa sell it good too cheaply and demand not only that that naughty vendor be compel by the court to raise it price but also that it be punish for the act of lower them in the first place so while the statist could afford to take a couple of hundred year to trash my economy and my liberty we certainly can not count on have an equivalent period of stability in which to reclaim them i contend that there exist almost a black hole effect in the evolution of nation-state just a in the evolution of star once free dom contract beyond a certain minimum extent the state warp the fabric of the political continuum about itself to the degree that subsequent re-emergence of freedom become all but impossible a good illustration of thi can be see in the area of so-called welfare payment when those who sup at the public trough outnumber and thu outvote those whose taxe must replenish the trough then what possible choice ha a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak ing from the few for the unearned benefit of the many go down to the nearest welfare office find just two person on the dole and recognize that between them they form a vote bloc that can forever outvote you on the question of who own ymy life and the fruit of ymy life labor so essentially those who love liberty need an edge of some sort if we ultimately go to prevail we obvus ously ca use the altruist other-directednes of work slave suffer sacrifice so that next generation of a billion random stranger can live in a better world recognize that however immoral such an appeal might be it be nonetheles an extremely powerful one in today culture if you can convince person to work energetically for a cause care only enough for their personal welfare so a to remain alive enough and healthy enough to continue work then you have a truly massive reservoir of energy to draw from equally clearly thi be just the sort of ap peal which tautologically can not be utilize for egoistic or libertarian goal if i be to stand up before you tonight and say something like listen follow me a i enunciate my noble cause contribute ymy money to support the cause give up ymy free time to work for the cause strive selflessly to bring it about and then after you and ymy child be dead maybe ymy child child will actu ally live under egoism you all think i go mad and of course you be right because the point i try to make be that libertarianism egoism will be spread if when and a individual libertarian egoist find it profitable enjoyable to do so and probably only then while i certainly do not disparage the concept of poli tical action i do believe that it be the only nor even necessarily the most cost-effective path toward increase freedom in my time consider that for a fraction of the investment in time money and effort i might expend in try ing to convince the state to abolish wiretapping and all form of censorship i can teach every libertarian who in terested how to use cryptography to abolish them unilaterally there be a maxim a proverb generally attribute to the eskimo which very likely most libertarian have al ready hear and while you likely would not quarrel with the say you might well feel that you hear it often enough already and that it ha nothing further to teach u and moreover that maybe you even tire of hear it i shall therefore repeat it now if you give a man a fish the say run you fee him for a day but if you teach a man how to fish you fee him for a lifetime ymy exposure to the quote wa probably in some sort of a workfare v welfare context namely that if you genuinely wish to help someone in need you should teach him how to earn hi sustenance not simply how to beg for it and of course thi be true if only because the next time he be hungry there might not be anybody around will or even able to give him a fish wherea with the information on how to fish he be completely self sufficient but i submit that thi exhaust only the first order content of the quote and if there be nothing further to glean from it i would have waste ymy time by cite it again after all it seem to have almost a crypto-altruist slant a though to imply that we should structure my ac tivity so a to maximize the benefit to such hungry beggar a we may encounter but consider suppose thi eskimo do know how to fish but he do know how to hunt walruse you on the other hand have often go hungry while travel thru walru country because you have no idea how to catch the damn thing and they eat most of the fish you could catch and now suppose the two of you decide to exchange information barter fish knowledge for hunt knowledge well the first thing to observe be that a transaction of thi type categorically and unambiguously refute the marxist premise that every trade must have a winner and a loser the idea that if one person gain it must necessarily be at the expense of another person who losis clearly under thi scenario such be not the case each party ha gain some thing he do not have before and neither ha be dimin ished in any way when it come to exchange of information rather than material object life be no longer a zero-sum game thi be an extremely powerful notion the law of diminish return the first and second law of thermodynamic all those law which constrain my possi bility in other context no longer bind u now that anarchy or consider another possibility suppose thi hungry eskimo never learn to fish because the ruler of hi nation-state have decree fish illegal because fish contain dangerou tiny bone and sometime sharp spine he tell u the state ha decree that their consumption and even their possession be too hazardou to the person health to be permit even by knowledgeable will adult perhap it be because citizen body be think to be government property and therefore it be the function of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern ment property or perhap it be because the state gener ously extend to competent adult the benefit it provide to child and to the mentally ill namely a full-time all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship so that they need not trouble themself with make choice about behavior think physically risky or morally naughty but in any case you stare stupefy while ymy eskimo informant re late how thi law be take so seriously that a friend of hi wa recently imprison for year for the crime of po session of nine ounce of trout with intent to distribute now you may conclude that a society so grotesquely oppressive a to enforce a law of thi type be simply an affront to the dignity of all human be you may go far ther and decide to commit some portion of ymy discretion ary recreational time specifically to the task of thwart thi tyrant goal ymy rationale may be altruistic in the sense of want to liberate the oppress or egoistic in the sense of prove you can outsmart the oppressor or very likely some combination of these or per hap even other motive but since you have zero desire to become a martyr to ymy cause you not about to mount a military campaign or even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade however it be here that technology and in particular in formation technology can multiply ymy efficacy literally a hundredfold i say literally because for a fraction of the effort and virtually none of the risk attendant to smuggle in a hundred fish you can quite readily produce a hundred xerox copy of fish instruction if the tar get government like present-day america at least permit open discussion of topic whose implementation be re stricted then that should suffice but if the government attempt to suppres the flow of information a well then you will have to take a little more effort and perhap write ymy fish manual on a floppy disk encrypt accord to ymy mythical eskimo public-key parameter but a far a increase real-world acces to fish you have make genuine nonzero headway which may continue to snowball a other re-disseminate the information you have provide and you have not have to waste any of ymy time try to convert id eological adversary or even try to win over the unde cided recall harry browne dictum from freedom in an unfree world that the succes of any endeavor be in general inversely proportional to the number of person whose persua sion be necessary to it fulfilment if you look at history you can not deny that it ha be dramatically shape by man with name like washington lincoln nixon marco duvalier khadaffi and their ilk but it ha also be shape by person with name like edison curie marconi tesla and wozniak and thi latter shape ha be at least a per vasive and not nearly so bloody and that where i try to take the libertech project rather than beseech the state to please not en slave plunder or constrain u i propose a libertarian net work spread the technology by which we may seize freedom for ourself but here we must be a bite careful while it be not at present illegal to encrypt information when government want to spy on you there be no guarantee of what the fu ture may hold there have be bill introduce for exam ple which would have make it a crime to wear body armor when government want to shoot you that be if you be to commit certain crime while wear a kevlar vest then that fact would constitute a separate federal crime of it own thi law to my knowledge ha not pass yet but it do indicate how government think other technological application however do indeed pose legal risk we recognize for example that anyone who help a pre-civil war slave escape on the underground railroad wa make a clearly illegal use of technology a the sovereign government of the united state of america at that time find the buy and sell of human be quite a acceptable a the buy and sell of cattle simi larly during prohibition anyone who use hi bathtub to ferment yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug alcohol the control substance wine wa use technol ogy in a way that could get him shoot dead by federal agent for hi crime unfortunately not to be restore to life when congres reverse itself and re-permitted use of thi drug so to quote a former president un-indicted co conspirator and pardon felon let me make one thing perfectly clear the libertech project do not advocate participate in or conspire in the violation of any law no matter how oppressive unconstitutional or simply stupid such law may be it do engage in description for educa tional and informational purpose only of technological process and some of these process like fly a plane or manufacture a firearm may well require appropriate li cense to perform legally fortunately no license be need for the distribution or receipt of information it self so the next time you look at the political scene and despair think well if of the nation and of thi state and of thi city have to turn libertarian before i be free then somebody might a well cut my goddamn throat now and put me out of my misery recognize that such be not the case there exist way to make ymy self free if you wish to explore such technique vium the project you be welcome to give me ymy name and addres or a fake name and mail drop for that matter and you go on the mail list for my erratically-published newsletter any friend or acquaintance whom you think would be interest be welcome a well i not even ask for stamp self address envelope since my printer can handle mail la bel and actual postage cost be down in the noise compare with the other effort in get an issue out if you should have an idea to share or even a useful product to plug i be glad to have you write it up for publication even if you want to be the proverbial free rider and just benefit from what other contribute you still welcome everything will be public domain feel free to copy it or give it away or sell it for that matter if you can get money for it while i take full-page ad try to give it away you certainly entitle to ymy capitalist profit anyway every application of these principle should make the world just a little freer and i certainly will to underwrite that at least for the forseeable fu ture i will leave you with one final think if you do learn how to beat ymy plowshare into sword before they outlaw sword then you sure a hell ought to learn before they outlaw plowshare too chuck hammill the libertech project queensbury drive lo angele californium hammill the above libertech
