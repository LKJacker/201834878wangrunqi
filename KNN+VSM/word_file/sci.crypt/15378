from john kelsey subject the wiretap chip clone and secure key-exchange write the cryptographic algorythm must be keep secret or private individual could make clipperclone with which they could transmit message which the feed would not have ready acces to not necessarily i be think about thi and if thi be to provide any real security there must be some sort of key exchange either use a public-key encryption scheme or use a key exchange scheme like diffie-hellman if there an out-of-band transmission of a share session key then what protect that band from eavesdrop if the phone company or some other online central authority generate a session key and send it to both user then what the point of go to the trouble of have some complicate key-depository just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call now it probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key use by anyone anywhere right so probably there will be some way of get these key verify thi might be a digitally sign by the chip manufacturer copy of the public key in thi unit store by thi unit it might also be an online directory with acces to everyone public key thi would introduce another weaknes to the security of the scheme of course presumably if you do use ymy designate key you ca get a verify connection to other standard chip it might be useful to have a modify chip which would allow you to use either the original key pair or some other key pair and verification scheme unfortunately thi would not allow you to call most person and establish secure communication john kelsey i hope somebody start do thi soon after the first one be release
