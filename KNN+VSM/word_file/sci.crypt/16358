from john kelsey subject one-time pad authentication i can think of a couple of way of guarantee authenticity in a one-time pad encrytped scheme though i not sure how to prove that what kind of authenicity they provide an obviou first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random unpredictable for eve block to the message and then calculate a crc which include the random start block and all of the message thi could be encrypt after the message the problem be i not sure it impossible to come up with a message that will hash to the same crc regardles of the random start block it intuitively seem like it ought to be hard but i not that sure clearly a crypto-strength hash like or the sha would be stronger but again i not sure i comfortable claim that it unbreakable a scheme to use up some of the pad bite to decide how many bite of to include in the plaintext stream before go on would be too bad either at the cost of increase the speed with which you use up ymy pad thi could be use to give you arbitrarily low probability that ymy opponent could spoof a valid-looking message since any decipher plaintext in a spot that should be carry will show that something funny go on if for each message bite we use up one random bite to decide whether to insert a into the plaintext stream we get a total pad use of time the message length we expand the message size by about half each that should appear in the plaintext stream that do be a gues for my would-be spoofer at each bite she ha to gues i try to see how to quantify her chance of make it all the way through the spoof message but it get a little complicate because she can get un synched and still happen to have a in that place in the spoof message now i can see a simple way of do thi that get to be a secure a a one-time pad at a cost of use time the message length in pad bite for each message bite use one random bite and xor them together to get now encrypt the three bite with the one-time pad the enemy ha no way of guess what be so ca gues what be either any change she make in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a gues of what wa is there any way to do thi without use so many pad bite spoofing the message be equivalent to correctly guess a many random bite a there be bite in the message clearly thi make spoof message just a hard if you know the whole message text a if you know none of it in fact it look to me like thi make it just a hard to generate a spoof message with the ciphertext a without it but i not entirely sure about that is there an easier way of do thi that provably a secure a the one-time pad john kelsey
