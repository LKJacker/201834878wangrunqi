from tf tim scanlon subject re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key-escrow after read the debate over the clipper i have a few thing to add first most of the person i know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issue that surround thi debate and any question about what be or be not ok to use in the u all they care about be wether or not what they be use be secure or not that after all is the bottom line second if i look at all the person i know who use any form of encryption at all and thi group span person from the moron who still insist that the de be a good and secure standard to person look at try to improve upon exist strategy i can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaf their method open to abuse the clipper do thi because person make mistake by nature and the u government be make up of person who be just a vulnerable to mistake a everyone else third since most of the person i know be at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerability present in current software encryption stratigy i ca see how most of them be go to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the clipper chip that despite any strength or weakness that may exist in it so i can not see a high degree of confidence develop in the chip fourth when it come to criminal abuse sure there be many stupid person out there and ye some will be open to be catch vium the build in back door of the clipper chip however anyone who be go to do any seriou investigation of how best to secure their datum be go to run into that problem pretty damn fast and i would assume start look around for other easily obtainible method of encryption if nothing else be avalible none of thi would be an issue however the truth be that most private encryption user that i ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal statu of rsa or pgp or anything else if it work they use it thi be not go to change either i do not think for a moment that anyone with seriou criminal intent will be slow down by the advent of the clipper chip it be all to easy to convert encrypt datum into unintellgible garbage a it be if anything the clipper chip just add another tool to the user the bottom line here be that person will use what work and unavoidibly i sure most criminal would rather face an encryption relate charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charge in the case of criminal who murder a part of their conspiricy the other thing that ha strike me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption ha begin be that quite simply the cat be out of the bag or if you have an interest in snoop pandora box ha be open and thi be not go to change i see a blindnes to thi that i find utterly stun and the clipper chip along with the way it ha be present only confirm thi to me to a larger degree sincerly tim scanlon tf
