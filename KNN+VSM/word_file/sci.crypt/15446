from ameline ian ameline subject screw the person crypto be for hard-core hacker spook only i suspect that thi clipper thing could backfire on the gov in a big hurry i expect that product use these chip will socket them rather than solder them since once the key be hand over by the escrow agency the chip be so much garbage and will need to be replace i expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that use secure encryption possibly even disguise so that it not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the backdoor key if i be to manufacture such a chip a part of my market strategy i would try to subvert one or both escrow agency either through bribe or industrial espionage and then publicize the fact do my best not to be connect with such activity which would likely not be legal publicly discredit the escrow agency would go quite far toward create a market for a secure alternative i also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread any back door or weakness would further discredit the scheme and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative i believe that the company that provide such an alternative will make few friend in the le community but lot of money i also believe that the government will do it best to make such plug replacement illegal i expect that they will see the same succes in limit the availability of such alternative a they have see in limit the availability of certain illicit drug ie little to none regard ian ameline of course the ramble above have nothing to do with my employer nor do i necessarily advocate do any of the thing describe here i just believe that the event above be likely to take place
