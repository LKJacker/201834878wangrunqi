from crypt-comment subject cryptography faq basic cryptology archive-name last-modified faq for part basic cryptology thi be the third of ten part of the faq the part be mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest we do have the time to send out miss part by mail so do ask note such a refer to the reference list in the last part the section of thi faq be available vium anonymou ftp to a xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroup and every day content what be cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key what reference can i start with to learn cryptology how do one go about cryptanalysi what be a brute-force search and what be it cryptographic relevance what be some property satisfy by every strong cryptosystem if a cryptosystem be theoretically unbreakable then be it guarantee analysis-proof in practice why be many person still use cryptosystem that be relatively easy to break what be cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key the story begin when juliu caesar send message to hi trust acquaintance he do trust the messenger so he replace every a by a c every b by a d and so on through the alphabet only someone who know the shift by rule could decipher hi message a cryptosystem or cipher system be a method of disguise message so that only certain person can see through the disguise cryptography be the art of create and use cryptosystem cryptanalysi be the art of break cryptosystem see through the disguise even when you not suppose to be able to cryptology be the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysi the original message be call a plaintext the disguise message be call a ciphertext encryption mean any procedure to convert plaintext into ciphertext decryption mean any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext a cryptosystem be usually a whole collection of algorithm the algorithm be label the label be call key for instance caesar probably use shift by n encryption for several different value of n it natural to say that n be the key here the person who be suppose to be able to see through the disguise be call recipient other person be enemy opponent interloper eavesdropper or third party what reference can i start with to learn cryptology for an introduction to technical matter the survey article give in part be the best place to begin a they be in general concise author by competent person and well write however these article be mostly concern with cryptology a it ha develop in the last year or so and be more abstract and mathematical than historical the codebreaker by kahn be encyclopedic in it history and technical detail of cryptology up to the introductory cryptanalysi can be learn from gaine or sinkov thi be recommend especially for person who want to devise their own encryption algorithm since it be a common mistake to try to make a system before know how to break one the selection of an algorithm for the de draw the attention of many public researcher to problem in cryptology consequently several textbook and book to serve a text have appear the book of denning gife a good introduction to a broad range of security include encryption algorithm database security acces control and formal model of security similar comment apply to the book of price davy and pfleeger the book of konheim and meyer matya be quite technical book both konheim and meyer be directly involve in the development of de and both book give a thorough analysi of de konheim book be quite mathematical with detail analysis of many classical cryptosystem meyer and matya concentrate on modern cryptographic method especially pertain to key management and the integration of security facility into computer system and network the book of rueppel and koblitz concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography how do one go about cryptanalysi classical cryptanalysi involf an interest combination of analytical reason application of mathematical tool pattern find patience determination and luck the best available textbook on the subject be the military cryptanalytic series it be clear that proficiency in cryptanalysi be for the most part gain through the attempt solution of give system such experience be consider so valuable that some of the cryptanalyasis perform during wwius by the ally be still classify modern public-key cryptanalysi may consist of factor an integer or take a discrete logarithm these be not the traditional fare of the cryptanalyst computational number theorist be some of the most successful cryptanalyst against public key system what be a brute-force search and what be it cryptographic relevance in a nutshell if f x y and you know y and can compute f you can find x by try every possible x that brute-force search example say a cryptanalyst ha find a plaintext and a correspond ciphertext but do know the key he can simply try encrypt the plaintext use each possible key until the ciphertext match or decrypt the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever be faster every well-designed cryptosystem ha such a large key space that thi brute-force search be impractical advance in technology sometime change what be consider practical for example de which ha be in use for over year now ha or about possible key a computation with thi many operation wa certainly unlikely for most user in the the situation be very different today give the dramatic decrease in cost per processor operation massively parallel machine threaten the security of de against brute force search some scenario be describe by garron and outerbridge one phase of a more sophisticate cryptanalysi may involve a brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibility what be some property satisfy by every strong cryptosystem the security of a strong system reside with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret a strong cryptosystem ha a large keyspace a mention above the unicity distance be a measure which gife the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercept to uniquely identify the key and if for some key the unicity distance be much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system be probably strong a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appear random to all standard statistical test see for example a strong cryptosystem will resist all know previou attack a system which ha never be subject to scrutiny be suspect if a system pas all the test mention above be it necessarily strong certainly not many weak cryptosystem look good at first however sometime it be possible to show that a cryptosystem be strong by mathematical proof if joe can break thi system then he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factor integer see part failing that it a crap shoot if a cryptosystem be theoretically unbreakable then be it guarantee analysis-proof in practice cryptanalytic method include what be know a practical cryptanalysi the enemy do have to just stare at ymy ciphertext until he figure out the plaintext for instance he might assume crib stretch of probable plaintext if the crib be correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message or he might exploit isolog the same plaintext encipher in several cryptosystem or several key thu he might obtain solution even when cryptanalytic theory say he do have a chance sometime cryptosystem malfunction or be misuse the one-time pad for example losis all security if it be use more than once even chosen-plaintext attack where the enemy somehow fee plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key have be employ see why be many person still use cryptosystem that be relatively easy to break some do know any better often amateur think they can design secure system and be not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could do and sometime there be insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work need to crack a system
