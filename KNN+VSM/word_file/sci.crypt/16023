from pat pat myrto subject re hearing on april in article tmplee theodore lee write in article glenn s tenney tenney write of interest i understand that on april mr markey will be hold a hear on the question raise in thi letter there may also be a follow-on hear dedicate to the clipper chip but that not definite glenn thank for post that i wa surprise to notice however that one question i might have expect to be ask wa not are all form of strong encryption other than the clipper to be make illegal speaking of which be anyone aware of whether that question ha be ask of any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government i have not yet see it mention in any of a dozen place it might have be report but i could have easily miss it please let u know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality of other strong cryptosystem so far any reference i have see have be weasel-word more plan in the future etc but nothing that could be take a a no strong crypto will not be outlaw i have hear not verify that the crime bill before congres ha language that either require escrow of key or that will regard all system for public use like strong cryptosystem not trivially break by the govt or without escrowed key which one can not readily change read use be only permit by folk with connection or government agency a either tool or dealer tool not outlaw specifically but by add civil forfeiture power and clever word effectively outlaw for all intent and purpose now for some idle speculation for those who do care hit now crypto be effectively outlaw could be do without specifically outlaw any clas of crypto system for example a crowbar hammer screwdriver and such can be regard a tool pretty much at the whim of the authority base primarily on the individual possess them in the car etc not be in a trade that make routine use of these tool in a like manner one who ha no need definition for strong crypto software or system and be catch use them might find themself in possession of tool in other word if one be not work for a corporation with extremely sensitive commercial datum that warrant in the fed opinion strong security or a government agency and secure only work-related datum not personal datum one will most likely be nail on thi if discoverd a personal desire for most certainly will not be regard a a need why do you want such strong security especially from law enforcement an individual with endeavor would not be so concern government be not in the busines of reveal ymy personal secret to the public so you must be try to conceal or plan to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity do you have something to hide hmmmm i expect that initially there will be some person select either at random or who happen to have be for the purpose of an example for those who think the fed be not seriou about thi mega one ask about a to privacy will probably get a response that there be no constitutional right for privacy spell out a such an argument use in the abortion debate you do not have a right to have security that law enforcement can not break a suggest in the clipper pres release thi in a nutshell be what i find so extremely frighten not only for crypto system a in thi case but for the precident it will set lay the groundwork for future erosion of privacy escrow of both safe-deposit box key key or combination for privately own safe and so on why not i can not think of a better way to make an around those part of the u constitution a law can not be easily declare unconstitutional if it there is no specific law it would simply be a minor extension of the rico statute or wod policy a simple policy decision just like so many of the gun regulation be mainly batf policy decision the conversation of the fed agent would go something like we be gon na seize ymy home ymy computer ymy car ymy bank account you do have to undres and give u yer clothe unles you have a floppy in yer pocket because they be all connect with ymy acquisition transport and use of tool dealer tool part of the wod or against terrorism ya unnerstand no decent american subject would be against these noble cause note we be not accuse you of any wrong-doing we be only say ymy home computer car bank asset be connect with wrong-doing somehow they house transport and fund these tool only a civil matter heh-heh we have thi grin therefore the constitutional protection on individual right do not apply we be the taint property not you evil grin if you wish to deposit a bond hire some attorney and go to court to prove the innocence of thi property that they be not tool and again to prove they be not also dealer tool go ahead we have no problem with that with ymy bank asset seize no car computer or home probably no job too and ymy less-than-limitles resource you might run into some minor practical difficulty grin that be what ha me go so damn ballistic it be exactly how the logic go when someone gife a that ymy home ha be use to store drug note no trace of drug need to be find on the property only some bozo who will say i store stuff in that dude house probably to get out of a year sentence for deal much more cost effective to let him walk to bust another day and hit the jackpot with ymy asset ob disclaimer of course ok note that i be not a lawyer and can only base these speculation on what i have tell regard past civil forfeiture case and how they be use to augment the budget of assort agency or to get of folk who just want to be leave alone or who do not wish to be put in a risky situation especially in area where they be deny either meaningful polouse protection and the mean to be able to even pretend to defend themself a be quite common back east like nj ma nyc wa dc or out west in ca these person have the choice of cower under the government boot or cower under threat of piss off drug deal gang-banger helples in either case all behind some dude who drop a dime on you for hi gain or behind the fed want to an example civil forfeiture be the point be be these speculation way out of line or be they all too typical and if so do the extension to crypto and just about anything that the fed regard a seem reasonable and if not why not what be my guarantee beside the government promise none ted lee trusted information system inc tmplee po box minnetonka mn pat without prejudice ucc pat myrto
