from mike mike h subject re clipper chip and crypto key-esc in article peter write i think it wa quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line maybe they have take a crash course in datum comm and have a unit that demodulate the tone and store the digital stream for decryption later thi would still suffer from the call babt it ha be state either here or in the group that they will not approve equipment that do encryption i do know if thi be true or not but thi would make a good test case peter ilieve peter you forget the obviou if it be an authorise tap then it can be do at the exchange if the exchange be digital then i suspect that you can auto-monitor a line and pickup the full link therefore sync a piggyback modem on the line would not be impossible i suspect mike h mike
