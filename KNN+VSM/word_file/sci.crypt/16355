from olson bryan olson cmsc g subject advanced one time pad wa re more one time pad stuff if you read thi group for a while you know all about the one-time-pad but here a question i have see the one-time-pad yeild ideal security but ha a well-known flaw in authentication suppose you use a random bite stream a the pad and exclusive-or a the encryption operation if an adversary know the plaintext of a message he can change it into any other message here how it work alouse be send bob a plaintext p under a key stream s alouse compute the ciphertext c s xor p and send it to bob eve know the plainext p but want the message to appear a p eve intercept c and compute c c xor p xor p s xor p eve send c to bob bob decrypt c by compute s p thu receive the false message which wa substitute by eve now the question be how can thi attack be defeat with information theoretic security not just computational security can we define something like ideal authentication which be the analog of ideal security can we obtain ideal authentication if not how much can we limit eve control over the message if we can achieve ideal authentication do the solution use more key bite or expand the message can we show the solution to be optimal in one or more parameter do anyone know if these question have be aswered before olson
