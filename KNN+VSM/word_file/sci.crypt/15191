from bontchev vesselin bontchev subject re text of white house announcement and q a on clipper chip encryption clipper clipper chip announcement write the president today announce a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communication while meet the legitimate need of law enforcement a nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption device with built-in trapdoor just like the fed want for too long there ha be little or no dialogue between my private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenge of protect american rather than use technology to accommodate the sometime compete interest of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previou policy have pit government against industry and the right of privacy against law enforcement bla-bla protect electronic mail and computer file while encryption technology can help american protect busines secret and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be use by terrorist drug dealer and other criminal indeed and the current proposal do nothing to prevent the latter an ordinary telephone it scramble telephone communication use an encryption algorithm that be more powerful than many in commercial use today thi do say much there be many incredibly weak encryption algorithm in commercial use today thi new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of datum transmit electronically except from the government at the same time thi technology preserve the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agency to intercept lawfully the phone conversation of criminal nope the criminal wo be stupid enough to use the new chip they use something secure thi technology provide only mean to intercept the phone conversation of person who be stupid enough to use it agency to decode message encode by the device when the device be manufacture the two key will be deposit separately in two key-escrow datum basis that will be establish by the attorney general acces to these key will be limit to government official with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap that be the government ha the key it do matter much if they be in one or in two of it hand the clipper chip technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to acces the content of the private conversation of american correct it do however provide those american with the false sense of privacy device in addition respect expert from outside the government will be offer acces to the confidential detail of the algorithm to ass it capability and publicly report their find if the screen be not public it can not be trust some person do not trust de even today after all the examination only because some part of it design be keep secret the chip be an important step in address the problem of encryption dual-edge sword encryption help to protect the privacy of individual and industry but it also can shield criminal and terrorist we need the clipper chip and other approach that can both provide law-abiding citizen with acces to the encryption they need and prevent criminal from use it to hide their illegal activity in order to ass technology so they use a different technology to hide their illegal activity so will those law-abiding citizen who do not trust their government not to misuse it ability to decrypt their conversation the privacy of my citizen include the need to employ voice or datum encryption for busines purpose except from the government the need of company to manufacture and export high technology product huh later it say that the new technology will be export restrict since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy regard it use the administration be commit to policy that protect all american right to privacy while also protect them from those who break the law in short the new technology can protect the law abide citizen privacy from the casual snooper it can not protect him from the government if it decide to misuse it ability to decrypt the conversation protect him from the criminal who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the key or to bribe the person who handle them etc prevent the criminal from use secure encryption for communication q do thi approach expand the authority of government agency to listen in on phone conversation a no clipper chip technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to acces the content of the private conversation of american correct however it do not provide them that much privacy a it claim q who will run the key-escrow datum bank a the two key-escrow datum bank will be run by two independent entity at thi point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agency will oversee the key-escrow datum bank two candidate the nsa and the mafium q how strong be the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security be a thi system be more secure than many other voice encryption system readily available today that be trust u while the algorithm will remain classify to protect the security of the key escrow security through obscurity system we be will to invite an independent panel of cryptography expert to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential user that there be no unrecognized vulnerability if it not entirely open to public examination it can not be trust beside who can prove that the device use for examination and the one build into ymy phone will be the same q whose decision wa it to propose thi product a the national security council the justice department the the nsa and the fbi q who wa consult the congres industry a we have on-going discussion with congres and industry on encryption issue and expect those discussion to intensify a we carry out my review of encryption policy we have brief member of congres and industry leader on the decision relate to thi initiative why do they forget the academium q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturer a the government design and develop the key acces encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product manufacturer product manufacturer can acquire the microcircuit from the chip manufacturer that produce them do thi smell to monopolism q who provide the clipper chip a mykotronx program it at their facility in torrance californium and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturer the program function could be license to other vendor in the future like the mafium q if the administration be unable to find a technological solution like the one propose would the administration be will to use legal remedy to restrict acces to more powerful encryption device thi be the main question why wa it bury at the end a thi be a fundamental policy question which will be consider during the broad policy review the key escrow we see mechanism will provide american with an encryption product that be more secure more convenient and le expensive than other readily available today but it be just one trust u the administration be not say since encryption threaten the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright a some country have in short if we decide to outlaw strong crypto we tell you effectively do nor be the say that every american a a matter of right be entitle to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there be a since the u government seem to consider strong crypto a munition and since the u constitution guarantee the right to every american to bear arm why be not every american entitle a a matter of right to an unbreakable commercial encryption product a it indicate that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunication and compute and be commit to work with industry and public-interest group to find innovative way to protect american privacy help business to compete and ensure that law enforcement agency have the tool they need to fight crime and terrorism bullshit the propose technology provide a false sense of security encryption device with built-in capability for break the encryption do not prevent the criminal to use strong crypto and be a step to outlaw strong crypto q will the device be exportable will other device that use the government hardware a voice encryption device be subject to export control requirement case-by-case review for each export be require to ensure appropriate use of these device the who wa the optimist who believe that the new administration will leave the export control on strong crypto device ok i not american it not my busines but i just could resist to comment the whole plot look so totalitaristic it up to you american to fight for ymy right regard vesselin now be the time for david sternlight to pop up and claim that the new system be great vesselin vladimirov bontchev viru test center university of hamburg tel fax fachbereich informatik agn pgp public key available on request
