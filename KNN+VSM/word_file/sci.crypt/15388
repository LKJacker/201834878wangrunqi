from gtoal graham toal subject re automatic online encryption of datum from andersom marc anderson also how about a box that you plug ymy phone into which would allow encrypt voice communication with someone who ha a similar box digitize input speech transmit and decrypt on the other end i do know how a public-key system could work in thi regard but it might heh heh i post thi just before read all the clinton chip message i gues they beat me to it anyway i think it would be a great idea to develop such a product perhap in the underground a it would otherwise probably become illegal pretty quickly here it really very feasible and should be too expensive all that need be a box with a phone jack on one side a dsp in the middle to do codec function of speech compress bytestream and an on the other side you plug ymy phone into it plug the into ymy computer and have a good old fashion normal modem on ymy other port the cpu in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modify to work on a byte stream with or better modem to carry the bytestream it should work quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone at the very highest price you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modem to do the digitisation that put an upper bind of about on the cost of such a box in practice you really ought to be able to get the price well below i could do it now in software on my cheap nasty home risc box acorn archimede with the digitise microphone i buy for pound if i know how to write good speech compression software which i do the reason it wo work of course be that hardly anyone will have one the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip economic i afraid however we can get about throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a modem when we get isdn for all ha ha ha and the new nren it might then be trivial to run compress speech over a connection on the internet perhap we should start think now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all my phone call in future joke g
