from steve-b steve brinich subject basic crypto requirement in order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography policy be acceptable we must set forth a list of basic requirement i would propose the follow a a start point the algorithm must be publicly know and must have a record of survive attempt by outside expert to find weakness the system implementation must make it possible to verify that the advertise algorithm be in fact the one that be be use the key must be quickly changeable by the user and must be of a sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search possible now or in the reasonably near future note that these requirement be not incompatible with some form of key escrow system the may issue of byte describe an example of an encryption system which can clearly be implement in a manner consistent with the above requirement while require that part of the key be escrowed in order to have one public key list by a central distributor
