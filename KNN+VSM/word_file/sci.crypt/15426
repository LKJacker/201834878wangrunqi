from caronni germano caronni subject re more technical detail hmm followup on my own post well who care first let me try to work out the fact that we get to know about the clipper-chip from what hellman and denning be able to tell u the chip itself be not confine to digital telephony but perform general encryption in a symmetric manner the chip support cfb ofb ecb and whatever the fourth mode of operation for de be the algorithm consist of round of whatever and take key input datum seem to be bit ye so if two person want secure communication whatever that mean when clipper be involve they have first to agree on one secret key or be it one key per direction they can exchange thi key vium dh-scheme or however somehow the two fee their so win secret key into the clipper-chip which be now ready to work the clipper chip carry an unique serial-number bit and key-bit these key-bit seem to have be gain by encrypt the serial-number with seed-bit the seed-bit seem not to be store in the chip at begin of communication and perhap at certain invterval whithin before send the fist real output of the first encryption the clipper chip put out packet i gues which represent the serial number and the session key thi might look like x e k serial number where x be a transformation of these packet involve a family-key thi family sp key be equal for all chip x might be a simple xor after that the digital phone-call can be do a usual every packet be encrypt and decrypt by clipper denning describe how and shall be generate use a seed of bit now leave alone politic which do not concern me a much a you not be an american citicien tm there be some weak point in thi scheme which might be exploit by several party a far a i know about the generation of and look like the obviou backdoor they could be use to generate the chip-key by know the serial-number and also the family-key of the chip i really ca imagine why these seed would be need otherwise a true random-source for the generation of the can be buy for not to much money then the escrow each of them will get bite of a key security could a little a existant be maximize by give them each which have to be xored together to give the now let simply assume the escrow be trustworthy and ca be fool by criminal or law enforchemnt agency and there will be no quarrel between escrow and which would hinder the in do their duty and so on and so on once the key be surrender the correspond chip be compromise forever not very clever imho how about send in the encrypt session-key for each phone-call that the polouse or whoever want to listen to escrow could then simply decode thi session-key and send it back to polouse and would naturally not do thi after the warrant ha expire thi would be a better technical solution but i gues politic will not work that way apparently a mis denning state the only one perform actually decode of intercept message shall be the fbi great so local guy can not inter cept understand ymy traffic anymore do thi mean that the fbi monopolize the right to do legal wiretap how be law over there i have no idea who be allow to tap and who not thi certainly mean that watch communi cation will be rout automatically from the service-providing company to the fbi if the communicaiton be a watch one and thi mean a far a i understand it that the family-key ha to be know by each switch company and those provide cellular-phone servy etcetc so the family-key will not be very secret and thu serial-number of call will be readable by anybody who care i like traffic-analysi what do you gues what happen if you use the chip in ecb mode and the first few packet of the chip be somehow lose or garble so the session key would not be actually broadcast over the line hmmm should be so difficult to do that and now a last point for the other side after all i have read and hear about clipper not the program language for dbase be it it seem to have many advantage which shold not be oversee now an afterthought to ymy right please note that i have no idea what i be talk about from grady amendment congres shall make no law respect an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof or abridge the freedom of speech or of the pres or the right of the person peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redres of grievance if thi text be actually in ymy bill of right who can overrule thi but of speech be not of speech maybe you need to extend ymy amendment to cover information and communication too i be not very sure in what position ymy government actually be legally when it try to ban cryptography and arm amendment say you may have them but not under what condition hmm tricky situation actually it will make not much sense to discus that topic in discussion of technical detail and vulnerabilite of the system be highly suggest and appreciate friendly greet germano caronni disclaimer everything in here be derive from thing i hear and read from other person so everything could be wrong all opinion and think in here be mine and subject to change without further notification no warranty neither implicit not explicit etc etc etc ad nauseam please do ask me about political opinion a i might not bother to re ply for further information read the last line of p metzger signature instrument register only through thing they design to register space still
