from kadie carl m kadie subject would clipper make a good cover for other encryption method clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of encryption currently when you send an encrypt message an opponent can usually tell that you be use encryption which encryption method you be use because that information be usually in the clear with clipper most opponent will only know that you be send clipper-text they wo know that ymy clipper-text be itself encode only those few opponent who get ymy clipper-key will know that ymy message be double encrypt kind of like a safety deposit box contain a lock box so do just think of replacement for clipper also think of front end carl carl kadie i do not represent eff thi be just me kadie kadie
