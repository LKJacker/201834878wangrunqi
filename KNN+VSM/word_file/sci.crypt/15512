from eachu robert i eachu subject re would clipper make a good cover for other encryption method in article kadie carl m kadie write clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of encryption but if you be make custom equipment in any case why not just roll ymy own clipper implementation and report the wrong key to the escrow agency tell u who be go to be in the chip busines if thi thing go through nsa and those with something to hide from nsa if anyone can verify that ymy phone be not use the key register to that serial number either they have a court order wiretap but what be they go to do tell the judge that thi individual really do have privacy all they know be that the key be not enough but not why they have a court order wiretap on a phone in thi series thi part be really scary since the expectation be that all chip in a particular batch will use seed base on the same and and the serial number get the key for one of a batch may give acces to all there be a backdoor which allow all message to be decipher without the key i find thi one especially threaten since the scheme seem very open to know plaintext attack what i need to decipher be the datum in the header if i talk to someone who ha one of these phone presumably there will be an automatically negotiate key generate i not try to decipher the record of the conversation to know what wa say i use it a a know plaintext to recover the backdoor represent by the header but i know what the header say for conversation i participate in even worse if the phone in a series have relate key i can buy a from the same production lot then i can recover it key either elegantly by talk to myself or by brute force analysi of the actual chip then apply the key generation proces with those seed to find the target key hmmm i do think i want to ever come close to these phone even de be start to look good two can and a string will provide much better security robert i eachu with use function message text in return be
