from mjr marcu j ranum subject re write to clinton white house is thi white house e-mail addres really work yet someone post such an addres on compuserve a few month ago but apparently the white house wa really set up to recive hundred thousand thi be a real addres my understand of the current proces that mail take be it get download on floppy disk and be process by retiree volunteer who match the message against message profile and check the message count yeah that a for gay in the military what thi clipper stuff must be against gay in the military the higher-volume white-house email stuff be in the work i know for a fact but wo be online for probably another month or two at the soonest my understand be that the link speed will increase direct internet instead of compu erve to floppy but the message process will remain the same unles the person at the white house print and distribute thi mail every day you may have better luck print out a letter on paper that flat white stuff all over my desk and snail-mailing it to the white house i imagine write to ymy local representative and senator would hurt either heck why not write to al gore while you at it the white house email do get read i agree that print it and send cc to everyone you can think of be probably better because it be more visible but the message process fit message against a template be the same in either case mjr
