from uni shaen bernhardt subject re once tap ymy code be no good any more in article amolitor andrew molitor write in article tcmay timothy c may write but be it any worse than the current unsecure system it become much worse of course if the government then use thi clinton clipper to argue for restriction on unapproved encryption thi be the main concern of most of u i think the camel nose in the tent etc not to pick on mr may in particular of course but be thi kind of the domino theory when one little country fall it neighbor will surely follow and before you know it we all mine salt in siberium for not turn in my captain crunch secret decoder ring i wish i could agree with you ask yourself thi why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that wa known to be at least partially compromise key escrow in thi instance why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that have not be properly evaluate algorythm not publically release the answer seem obviou to me they would there be other hardware out there not compromise de a an example triple de a a better one my suspicion be that the price will drop dramatically on these non clipper system if not we in trouble given that the clinton administration be not entirely stupid although we like to think so i can not believe that they have fail to realize thi they know their initiative will fail much a cripple de wa never take seriously the only way their move can work be by coercion you know little about politic if you do realize that thi be just a first step in the next move it make no sense otherwise the next move ban or severly cripple crypto not use the clipper system be easily justify why would anyone want other encryption unles they be try to subvert the government we provide you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to how can you reconcile the administration self proclaim purpose of provide law enforcement with acces to encrypt datum without make the clipper system the only crypto available in the you simply ca and the administration know it anyone who want to keep the govt out of their hair be it for drug deal or whatever would just buy still available non-clipper system do sell my crafty clinton type short they ca be that stupid either ban non clipper crypto be the next answer or the administration collective be about that of a potato why do you think at t jump on so fast they know it go to be big and not because it better right on the face of it noone will buy the stuff that do have to at t must know thi too think man why the hell would they jump the gun my interpretation andrew tim may whose sig block may get him bust in the new regime is thi just a little melodramatic i really wonder to wit the letter i just send to clinton the white house office of the pres secretary presidential comment line fax april sir madam i must object most strongly to the administration evolve position on encryption and cryptography i be shock at the clinton regime increase lean toward a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life it be apparent to me that those who draft the clipper chip proposal which be incidentally gain notoriety a the big brother proposal be either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed anyone knowledgeable in the nuance of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm especially one destine for standardization be the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sector the proper evaluation of an algorithm dep end on careful scrutiny by these sector and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm the assumption that a new algorithm will be accept base on assurance from expert without full disclosure be plain ignorance in addition the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology such a de when it be characterize by key escrow be lunacy it seem an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumer will prefer to purchase equipment not cripple by government key escrow no matter how tamper proof the key escrow might be i can not believe that even the least educate policy maker would have fail to realize these flaw i can only assume then that the drafter of the clipper chip proposal know very well the difficulty of sell a cripple system to the private sector the only way thi proposal make any sense or ha any chance of succeed be in coercion even the language of the proposal make it painfully clear that the next logical step be the outlaw of other encryption device and hardware that do not utu lize the big brother chip unfortunately the public at large be not educate enough on the issue to realize what they be lose i expect the big brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the american person who you will have so efficiently dupe once again with pretty word like harmony right to encryption and voluntary it mortify me that the phrase that seem to be use more and more often to characterize the clinton administration be i ca believe it happen here more startle be a question a colleague of mine pose and the realization that everyday it become more and more relevant when be the reichstag fire plan for most concerned signature shaen logan bernhardt i uni uni public key by finger request public key archive at pgp-public-key sovereignty be the sign of a brutal past cryptography be not a crime fight the big brother proposal
