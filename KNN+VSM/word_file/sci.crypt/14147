from marc vanheyningen mvanheyn subject ripem frequently asked question archive-name last-update sun mar about thi posting thi be a still rather rough list of likely question and information about ripem a program for public key mail encryption it thi faq not ripem wa write and will be maintain by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn it will be post to a variety of newsgroup on a monthly basi follow-up discussion specific to ripem be redirect to the group thi month i have reformatted thi post in an attempt to comply with the standard for hypertext faq format to allow easy manipulation of thi document over the world wide web let me know what you think disclaimer nothing in thi faq should be consider legal advice or anything other than one person opinion if you want real legal advice talk to a real lawyer question and answer what be ripem ripem be a program which perform privacy enhanced mail pem use the cryptographic technique of rsa and de it allow ymy electronic mail to have the property of authentication who send it can be confirm and privacy nobody can read it except the intend recipient ripem wa write primarily by mark riordan mrr most of the code be in the public domain except for the rsa routine which be a library call rsaref license from rsa datum security inc how can i get ripem ripem contain the library of cryptographic routine rsaref which be consider munition and thu be export-restricted from distribution to person who be not citizen or permanent resident of the or canada therefore the follow request be quote from the readme file please do not export the cryptographic code in thi distribution outside of the usa or canada thi be a personal request from me the author of ripem and a condition of ymy use of ripem note that rsaref be not in the public domain and a license for it be include with the distribution you should read it before use ripem the best way to get it be to ask a friend for a copy since thi will reduce the load on those site that do carry it not to mention the human that run them naturally thi require that you trust the friend ripem be available vium anonymou ftp to citizen and permanent resident in the from cd to rsaref and read the readme file for info last i look thi site contain only the source tree and do not contain compile binary or the nice mac version ripem a well a some other crypt stuff ha it home site on which be open to non-anonymou ftp for user in the and canada who be citizen or permanent resident to find out how to obtain acces ftp there cd to and read the file for convenience binary for many architecture be available here in addition to the full source tree will ripem run on my machine probably it ha already be port to ms-do and most flavor of unix suno next linux aix ultrix solari etc port to macintosh include a standard unix-style port and a rather nice mac-like port write by raymond lau author of stuffit more port be expect and help of user be invite will ripem work with my mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface be will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though the user guide include with the distribution discus way to use ripem with many popular mailer include berkeley mush elm and mh code be also include in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu emac if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe be convenient to use secure and may be useful to other feel free to post it to what be rsa rsa be a crypto system which be asymmetric or public-key thi mean that there be two different relate key one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one can not reasonably be derive from the other you may publish ymy encryption or public key widely and keep ymy decryption or private key to yourself anyone can use ymy public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key need to decrypt it note that the message send with rsa be normally just the de key to the real message see what be de note that the above only provide for privacy for authentication the fingerprint of the message see what be a fingerprint like be encrypt with the sender private key the recipient can use the sender public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender rsa wa name for the three man rivest shamir and adleman who invent it to find out more about rsa ftp to and look in or look in what be de de be the datum encryption standard a widely use symmetric or secret-key crypto system unlike rsa de use the same key to encrypt and decrypt message however de be much faster than rsa ripem use both de and rsa it generate a random key and encrypt ymy mail with de use that key it then encrypt that key with the recipient public rsa key and include the result in the letter allow the recipient to recover the de key de be sometime consider weak because it be somewhat old and use a key length consider too short by modern standard however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it be not unlikely that future ripem will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by use multiple encryption with de what be pem and how do ripem relate pem be privacy enhanced mail a system for allow easy transfer of encrypt electronic mail it be describe in rfc these document have be approve and obsolete the old rfc ripem be not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specify certificate for authenticate key which ripem do not handle at thi time their addition be plan what thi about distribute and authenticate key for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know ymy public key for you to be able to confirm that the message receive come from her you must know her public key it be important that thi information be accurate if a bad guy convince her that hi key be in fact your she will send message which he can read ripem allow for three method of key management a central server the distribute finger server and a flat file all three be describe in the ripem user guide which be part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security why do all ripem public key look very similar ripem public key begin with a pkc identifier describe variou characteristic about the key so the first bunch of character in ymy key may be the same a those of lot of other person key thi do not mean ymy key be similar but only that they be the same clas of key be generate with the same program be of the same length etc what be a fingerprint like be a message digest algorithm produce by rsa datum security inc it provide a fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it be cryptographically secure because it be not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produce the same fingerprint thu instead of sign the entire message with the sender private key only the of the message need to be sign for authentication be sometime use for other purpose for example it be often use to map an input of arbitrary length to bite of datum a a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator be describe in it entirety include an implementation in c in rfc what be pgp pgp be another cryptographic mail program call pretty good privacy pgp ha be around longer than ripem and work somewhat differently pgp be not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp do also use rsa some major difference between pgp and ripem pgp ha more key management feature particularly for user without a direct network connection ripem conform to the pem rfc and thu ha a greater probability of work with other pem software pgp make no attempt to be compatible with anything other than pgp in fact pgp be not compatible with pgp ripem use rsaref a library of rsa routine from rsa datum security inc rsaref come with a license which allow noncommercial use pgp use it own implementation of rsa which be not license thu pkp the firm hold the patent on the rsa algorithm claim that it be a infringement of that patent to make use or sell pgp in the or canada in acknowledgement of thi pgp original author phil zimmermann say in the documentation in fact if you live in the usa and you be not a federal agency you should actually run pgp on ymy computer because public key partner want to forbid you from run my software pgp be contraband both pgp and ripem be export-restricted and can not be send outside the and canada however pgp already exist on many ftp site in europe and other place whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp be recommend read to anyone interest in such issue note that the above fact both regard patent and export restriction be somewhat controversial many person think it should be that way and some person interpret variou document differently unfortunately discussion of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light and probably belong in see disclaimer what about rpem rpem stand for rabin privacy enhanced mail it wa similar to ripem but use a public-key cipher invent by rabin which be not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patent on rsa it wa write by mark riordan the same author a ripem it distribution wa halt when contrary to the belief of many include rabin public key partner pkp claim that their patent wa broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rest in the difficulty of factor product of large prime not just rsa thi claim be not universally accept by any mean but wa not challenge for pragmatic reason rpem be not really use anymore it be not compatible with ripem or pgp what be mime mime stand for multipurpose internet mail extension and be describe in rfc you can find out about it in the newsgroup how pem should interact with mime be not yet entirely clear some person use the stopgap solution of have a mime type in order to send ripem message a mime one i hope some standard will emerge draft internet document exist on the matter i have thi simple way to defeat the security of ripem you may wish to check the companion post ripem-attack which discus some of the more obviou attack on ripem security and what procedure will minimize the risk ripem main weak area be probably key distribution
