from neuhau stephan neuhau hiwi mattern subject re pgp general comment neuhau stephan neuhau hiwi mattern write lot of stuff i hate to follow up to my own post but i should perhap clarify some thing so i wo get flame first of all when i talk about factor the modulu or a breakthrough in factor what i really mean be a breakthrough in the cryptanalysi of rsa i know that factor and break rsa be not prove to be equivalent it just so damn convenient not to repeat thi every time i also have to admit that i do really know if the non-group property of a cipher be essential only for key chain i have think about it a little while but i ca find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure that of course mean nothing at all then i write please note that a long a it be much harder to factor a rsa modulu than it be to generate it the increase in computer speed alone will keep key length and modulu factor in lock-step person will simply start use longer modulus and still be safe what i mean wa that a long a the only advantage of the cryptanalyst be a faster computer then we will probably have rsa for a long time to come because even if modulus somehow could be break with fast computer not with a new algorithm then person would simply use longer modulus both user and cryptanalyst benefit from better technology in the same way hope thi keep the flame away have fun stephan neuhau sig close for inventory please leave ymy pickaxe outside pgp public key available on request note the expiration date
