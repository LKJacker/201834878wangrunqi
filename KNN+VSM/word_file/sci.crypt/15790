from tauren tauren n mill subject thought and question i just join thi group recently and really do not know much about cryptography but a couple thing come to mind while read through the post is the clipper chip go to be export if not how will person communicate with other country will they have to do that in un-crypt-mode will other encryption technique be legal assume the government crack down on use other when go oversea but not within the state i read about authentication system that use an electronic security card that look like a calculator to create an encrypt pin base on the the host system ha the algorithm build into it a well so that it can authenticate a user is there some form of encryption technology that would create key that be only valid at a certain instant in time the system would then allow a window of time around thi instant where the key would work i realize that thi technique would increase the amount of information need to be store because you would need entire algorithm rather than just key but for smaller scale thing it might work could some similar method be use to make the two key that be issue to to tap a phone only usable for one-week for instance if further surveilance wa need they would have to go back to the escrow service to get another key thi would make it useles for local polouse to database key they have use i assume thi be not possible because the receive phone would need to be able to decypher the message but any think on the subject thank tauren mill tauren mill tauren
