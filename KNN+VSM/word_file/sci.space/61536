from henry henry spencer subject re electrical spacecraft vium magnetic field of earth in article nsmca write okay the earth ha a magnetic field if you put a object in the earth magnetic field it produce electricty well it not that simple you in earth magnetic field and you do generate electricity but it can be do now the question can you use electricity to power a earth orbit vehicle and i fyou can can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power it the way you power thing be with electricity so the answer to the first question be definitely ye if you mean to say propel rather than power the answer be sort of ye you can use interaction with the earth magnetic field to get electrical power and there be potential application for thi however bear in mind that there be no free lunch the energy be come from nowhere what such system do be convert some of the energy of ymy orbital velocity into electrical energy there be case where thi be a useful tradeoff using power obtain in thi way for propulsion be useful only in special situation however what you can do be get ymy power by some other mean solar array and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse pump energy into the orbit rather than take energy out of it if you want more information try look up electrodynamic propulsion tether application and magsail can the idea of a dragles satellite be use in part to create the electrical field no a dragles satellite do not magically have no drag it burn fuel constantly to fight drag maintain the exact orbit it would have if there wa no drag thi be why there be quote around dragles resemble a high-speed collision henry spencer u of toronto zoology between and suno dick dunn henry utzoo henry
