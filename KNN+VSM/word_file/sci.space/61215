from steinly steinn sigurdsson subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article att prb pat write what evidence indicate that gamma ray burster be very far away their distribution be very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speak indicate we see an edge to the distribution given the enormou power i wa just wonder what if they be quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic range now in the good old day before gro datum it wa think the gamma burster be neutron star in the galaxy it wa expect that gro would confirm thi by either show they be a local population within a few hundred light year or that they be in the galactic halo mechanism wa not know but several plausible one exist also to be fair it wa note that the brightest burster wa probably in the lmc suggest theorist might be wrong back then a the sun be not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy a local disk population be rule out completely at thi stage to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out the energy then get large the mechanism of get n out that far become questionable and we should start to see for example the andromeda burster the datum be consistent with either a oort cloud distribution but only just but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum or it can be a cosmological distance hence isotropy and the edge be the edge of the universe if at cosmological distance you need very high energy to detect and a very compact source for spectrum ergo a neutron star collide with another neutron star or black hole even then get the spectrum be very hard but conceivable if we know anything about physic at that level the burster be not due to quantum black hole or cosmic string wrong spectrum for one thing the situation be further complicate by recent claim that there be two class of source in the collide n they actually probably fit relatively easily into the ns-n and ns-bh collision scenario respectively my own pet theory be that it flying saucer enter hyperspace but the reason i be ask be that most everyone assume that they be collide nuetron star or spin black hole i just wonder if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in if you can think of one remember to invite me to stockholm steinn sigurdsson lick observatory steinly standard disclaimer the law of gravity be very very strict and you just bend them for ymy own benefit
