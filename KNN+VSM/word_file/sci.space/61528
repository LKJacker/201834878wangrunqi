from kjenk subject re deployable space dock in article nsmca write why not build a inflatable space dock henry spencer henry write if you do large-scale satellite service be able to do it in a pressurize hangar make considerable sense the question be whether anyone be go to be do large-scale satellite service in the near future to the point of justify development of such a thing that a mighty fine idea but since you ask why not i respond putting aside the application of such a space dock there be other factor to consider than just pressurize volume temperature control be difficult in space and ymy inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation maybe a double-walled inflatable micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection be also require do think thi will be a clear plastic bubble it more likely to look like a big white ball make out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suit be make out of today because almost all man space vessel skylab mir salyut use their pressurization for increase structural rigidity even though they have have metal skin they still kind of qualify a inflatable the inflation proces would have to be carefully control the space environment reduce ductility in expose material due to temperature extreme monotomic oxygen impingement and radiation effect on material so ymy fabric may not retain any flexibility for long thi may not matter even after inflation pressure change in the hangar may cause flex in the fabric which could lead to hole and tear a ductility decrease these be some of the technical difficulty which the llnl proposal for an inflatable space station deal with to vary degree of succes ken jenk space shuttle program office kjenk good idea be common what uncommon be person who work hard enough to bring them about ashleigh brilliant
