from higgin bill higgin beam jockey subject why we like dc-x wa re shuttle bizarre dc-x ken ymy argument be thoughtful but you be go up against the big boy if you tackle henry allen sherzer will doubtles chime in on the subject of stagger operational cost too good luck son in article beo khayash ken hayashida write shuttle be the only method in the free world of orbit large life science and medical relate package ahem the russian be in the free world now or at least it would be politically correct to contend so i be hopeful that dc-x or whatever the follow-on be eventually call will perform a you state but right now i must admit that i be more skeptical than ever it will be tough to make dc-x succeed and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle doubtles it will fail to meet some of the promise goal the reason person be so fond of it be that it the only chance we have now or will have for a long time to come to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower cost there be no shuttle successor in fund development nasp be dwindle away and sure a hell be gon na knock any zero off that per pound cost part of the blame for thi must be place on a shuttle program that consume many annual billion of the er free world available space cash a you will no doubt hear from many correspondent in the day to come dc-x be an attempt to break out of the viciou cycle by keep development cost low and fly incremental x-plane hardware it be to my mind incredibly successful already they build a complex prototype in under day for under megabuck i would have be extremely skeptical that thi could be accomplish in america never mind fly the thing get a successor fund or build the dc-y i sure you know well that launch cost be the basic problem for any expansion of astronautic i do see a realistic prospect for beat down those cost for multi-ton payload anywhere else if the dc flop it be busines a usual in space the ninety and the double-ought will look just like the seventy and eighty a prospect too depress to bear pegasu represent another assault on the problem from a different direction it do lower cost-per-pound but it offer an orbital launch for under ten megabuck it create it own market for small payload i read the magazine and i attend the last two iaf there be plenty of engineer with paper idea for cheaper launch system some of them a good a or better than ssto there be no sign in today world that any of these design will be allow anywhere near an assembly line you could change my view on dc-x if you could prove the follow delete some thing i not go to prove tonight that the shuttle need not go on hiatu to allow development of a man-ratable dc-x successor strawman is anybody seriously propose thi reference please the dc must be develop in the real-world fund climate which include a nasa ferociously commit to continue shuttle operation a well a the bird in the hand argument ymy common sense tell you if dc-y fly at all it fly alongside the shuttle not instead of it also of course dc-y and it operational descendant will be useful for a wide variety of job even if they be not man-rated most importantly that the dc-x will open up leo to more scientific and technical payload if a dc-x successor can fly a payload for or even rather than the it now cost more person will be able to afford more payload for the same money you can fly several satellite instead of one big outfit can fly multi-satellite series little outfit will be able to fly spacecraft of their own instead of beg a ride thi be just supply and demand you should be able to convince yourself that point will be true assume dc make a big difference in cost do you have some reason to think not o zap bill higgin fermi national accelerator laboratory bitnet higgin internet higgin higgin
