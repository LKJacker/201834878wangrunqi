from nickh nick haine subject re shuttle launch question in article jcm jonathan mcdowell write my understand be that the error be basically know bug in the warn system software thing be check that do have the right value in yet because they be set till after launch and suchlike rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bug they just tell the crew if you see a warn no before liftoff ignore it good grief and i think the shuttle software wa know for be well-engineered if thi be actually the case every member of the program team should be take out and shoot give that i hear the shuttle software rat a level in maturity i strongly doubt that thi be the case nick haine nickh
