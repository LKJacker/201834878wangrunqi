from palmer david m palmer subject re gamma ray burster where be they prb pat write what evidence indicate that gamma ray burster be very far away given the enormou power i wa just wonder what if they be quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic range gamma ray burst grb be see come equally from all direction however give the number of bright one there be too few faint one to be consistent with be equally dense for a far a we can see it be a if they be all contain within a finite sphere or a sphere with fuzzy edge with u at the center these measurement be statistical and you can alway hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of grb with a different origin in the datum i be assume that there be only one population of grb the datum indicate that we be le than of the radiu of the center of the distribution the only thing the earth be at the exact center of be the solar system at the scale of the oort cloud of comet way beyond pluto and the universe cosmological theory place grb throughout the universe require supernova-type energy to be release over a timescale of millisecond oort cloud model tend to be silly even by the standard of astrophysic if grb be galactic distribute through the milky way galaxy you would expect them to be either concentrate in the plane of the galaxy for a population or toward the galactic center for a spherical population we do see thi so if they be galactic they must be in a halo at least light year in radiu and we would probably start to see grb from the andromeda galaxy assume that it ha a similar halo for comparison the earth be light-year from the center of the galaxy my own pet theory be that it flying saucer enter hyperspace the be concentrate in the know spacelane and we do see many come from zetum reticuli and tau cetus but the reason i be ask be that most everyone assume that they be collide nuetron star or spin black hole i just wonder if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in there be more than grb different model in the referee literature right now the theorist have a sort of unofficial moratorium on new model until new observational evidence come in david m palmer palmer palmer
