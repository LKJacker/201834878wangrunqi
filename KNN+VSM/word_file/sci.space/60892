from wingo subject re nasa wrap in article aw allen w sherzer write in article wingo write i do care who tell you thi it be not generally true i see every single line item on a contract and i have to sign it there be no such thing a wrap at thi university denni i have work on or write proposal worth ten of million of customer include government include nasa for profit and non-profit company all expect a wrap usually call a fee much of the work involve allocate and cost the work of subcontractor the subcontractor where university for-profit non-profit and even some of the nasa center for the commercialization of space all charge fee a part of the work down the street be one of the nasa commercialization center they charge a fee you totally forget the original post that you post allen in that post you state that the wrap wa on top of and in addition to any overhead geez in thi post you finally admit that thi be not true now i sure ymy a competent engineer denni but you clearly lack experience in several area ymy post show that you do understand the importance of integration in large project you also show a lack of understand of cost effort a show by ymy belief that it be reasonable to charge incremental cost for everything thi be a flame jsut a statement come ymy little ol bun down here and you will find out who be do what and who be work on integration thi be simply an ad hominum attack and you know it ymy employer do charge a fee you may not see it but you do of course there be a fee it be for administration geez allen any organization ha cost but there be a heck of a difference in legitimate cost such a library and other thing that must be there to support a program and wrap a you originally state state that wrap wa on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentence down you say be not true which be it allen sound like they be add it to their overhead rate go ask ymy cost person how much fee they add to a project i do they never hear of it but suggest that like my president do that any percentage number like thi be include in the overhead well there you be denni a i say they simply include the fee in their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depend on the customer a you have post on thi subject allen you state that wrap be over and above overhead and be a seperate charge you admit here that thi be wrong nasa ha a line item budget every year i have see it allen get some number from that detail nasa budget and dig out the wrap number and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you be bark in the wind no allen you do not you merely repeat allegation make by an employee of the overhead capital of nasa integration denni be overhead nothing that reston do could not be dont better or cheaper at the other nasa center where the work be go on integration could be do better at the center apollo integration wa do here at msfc and that do not turn out so bad the philosophy of reston be totally wrong allen there you have a bunch of person who be completely remove from the work that they be try to oversee there be no way that will ever work it ha never work in any large scale project that it wa ever try on could you imagine a reston like set up for apollo denni reston ha be the only nasa agency work to reduce cost when wp wa hemoraging out a billion the center you love so much where do their best to cover it up and ignore the problem reston wa the only place you would find person actually interest in solve the problem and build a station oh you be full of it allen on thi one i agree that jsc screw up big they should be responsible for that screw up and the person that cause it replace to make a stupid statement like that just show how deep ymy bia go come to msfc for a couple of week and you will find out just how wrong you really be maybe not person like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the fact be contrary to it kinda funny be it that someone who talk about a problem like thi be at a place where everything be overhead when you have a bite more experience denni you will realize that integration be overhead it be the single most important part of a successful large scale effort i agree that integration be the single most important part of a successful large scale effort what i completly disagree with be seperating that integration function from the person that be do the work it be call leadership allen that be what make apollo work final responsibility for the succes of apollo wa hold by le than person that be leadership and responsibility there be neither when you have any organization set up a reston be you could take the same person and move them to jsc or msfc and they could do a much better job why do it take a year for reston to finally say something about the problem if they be on site and part of the proces then the problem would have never get out of hand in the first place there be one heck of a lot i do not know allen but one thing i do know be that for a project to be successful you must have leadership i remember all of the turn over at reston that keep ssf program in shamble for year do you it be lack of responsibility and leadership that be the program problem lack of leadership from the white house congres and at reston nasa be only a symptom of a greater national problem you be so narrowly focus in ymy effort that you do not see thi why do the space news artice point out that it wa the congressionally demand change that cause the problem methink that you be be selective with the fact again the story you refer to say that some nasa person blame it on congres suprise suprise the fact remain that it be the center you support so much who cover up the overhead and would addres the problem until the pres publish the story are you say the reston manager where wrong to get nasa to addres the overrun you approve of what the center do to cover up the overrun no i be say that if they be locate at jsc it never would have happen in the first place if it take fmy flight a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of million a flight then you pay billion a year you state that ymy friend at reston say that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap be go thi merely point out a blatent contridiction in ymy number that understandably you fail to see you should know denni that nasa do include transport cost for resuply that come from the shuttle budget what they where say be that operational cost could be cut in half plu transport sorry gang but i have a deadline for a satellite so someone else be go to have to do allen math for him for a while i will have little chance to do so i do hope you can find the time to tell u just why it wa wrong of reston to ask that the problem with wp be address i have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that be at reston wa on site at jsc the problem never would have happen totally ignore the lack of leadership of congres thi many head hydra that ha grow up at nasa be the true problem of the agency and to try to change the question to suit you and ymy bia be only indicative of ymy position denni university of alabama in huntsville
