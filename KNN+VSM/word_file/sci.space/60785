from baalke ron baalke subject successful balloon flight measure ozone layer forwarded from public information office jet propulsion laboratory californium institute of technology national aeronautic and space administration pasadena calif contact mary a hardin for immediate release april scientist at nasa jet propulsion laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carry instrument design to measure and study chemical in the earth ozone layer the april flight from californium airport reach an altitude of kilometer foot and take measurement a part of a program establish to correlate datum with the upper atmosphere research satellite uar the datum from the balloon flight will also be compare to read from the atmospheric trace molecular spectroscopy atmo experiment which be currently fly onboard the shuttle discovery we launch these balloon several time a year a part of an ongoing ozone research program in fact jpl be actively involve in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important way say dr jim margitan principal investigator on the balloon research campaign there be two jpl instrument on the uar satellite he continue the atmo experiment be conduct by jpl scientist and the jpl balloon research provide collaborative grind truth for those activity a well a datum that be useful in it own right the measurement take by the balloon payload will add more piece to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring understanding the chemistry occur in thi region help scientist construct more accurate computer model which be instrumental in predict future ozone condition the scientific balloon payload consist of three jpl instrument an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measure ozone a the balloon ascend and descend through the atmosphere a submillimeterwave limb sounder which look at microwave radiation emit by molecule in the atmosphere and a fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitor how the atmosphere absorb sunlight launch occur at about noontime and follow a three hmy ascent the balloon float eastward at approximately kilometer per hmy knot datum wa radio to grind station and record onboard the flight end at pacific time in eastern new mexico when the payload wa command to separate from the balloon we need to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurement margitan explain and we also need to fly in darknes to watch how quickly some of the molecule disappear it will be several week before scientist will have the complete result of their experiment they will then forward their datum to the uar central datum facility at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland for use by the uar scientist the balloon wa launch by the national scientific balloon facility normally base in palestine tex operate under a contract from nasa wallop flight facility the balloon wa launch in californium because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest the balloon be make of mil or le than one-thousandth of an inch thick plastic and be cubic meter million cubic foot in volume when fully inflate with helium meter foot in diameter the balloon weigh between and kilogram and pound the scientific payload weigh about kilogram pound and be meter six foot square by meter foot high the jpl balloon research be sponsor by nasa upper atmosphere research program and the uar correlative measurement program ron baalke baalke jet propulsion lab telo being cynical never help pasadena ca to correct the situation and cause more aggravation instead
