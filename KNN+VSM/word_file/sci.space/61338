from prb pat subject re gamma ray burster where be they well i seem to have strike an interest discussion off given that i be not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist i have to boil it down a bite all the datum on burst to date show a smooth random distribution that mean they be concentrate in galactic core my or someone else if the distribution be smooth we be either see some enormously large phenomenon scatter at the edge of the universe say phenomenon be subject to debate almost a vioent a the phenomenon or we be see some phenomenon out at like the oort cloud but then it need some potent little energy source that be detectable by any other current method we know it not real close like slightly extra solar because we have no parallax measurement on the burst the burst seem to bright to be something like black hole quantum or super string impact or something like that so everyone be watch the datum and argue like mad in the meanwhile what i be wonder be thi in person opinion a new physic problem einstein get well know for solvingthe photoelectric effect copernicu start look at irregularity in planetary motion is thi a big enough problem to create a new area of physic just a little speculative think folk pat
