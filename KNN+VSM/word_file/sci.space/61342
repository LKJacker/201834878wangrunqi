subject re gamma ray burster positional stuff from belgarath in article kwp kevin w plaxco write in article abdkw david ward write given that fact and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of approx arcmin we might be able to figure out how well batse can determine the location rotational of a gamma ray burster from knowledge of the all-sky map accuracy pr material for the other three instrument give accuracy on the order of fraction of a degree if that any help but i believe that there be a fundamental difference here the other x three instrument be focus instrument that more or le form an image so positional error be limit by craft attitude and the resolve power of the optic batse be an altogether different beast effectively just coincidence counter one on each corner of the craft positional information be triangulate from the differential signal arrival time at each of the detector positional error would be predominantly determine by time error and error in craft attitude since none of the baste detector have any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be use to determine parallax indeed parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error demonstrating that these puppy be beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcsecond since the oort cloud be postulate to extend to about parsec all together now parallax arc second a parsec be the distance of an object that demonstrate one arc second of parallax with a au base line if the degree accuracy report above be true we go to have to add a baste to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline the beauty of baste be that it both gife positional information and watch the entire sky simultaneously a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst be come from kevin batse alone be alway use to determine position when a particularly bright burst occur there be a couple of other detector that catch it go off pioneer or be the one i get at here thi puppy be far enough away that if a bright burst happen nearby the huge annulu create by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle give by batse and we can get a moderately accurate position say oh or degree that be the closest anyone ha ever get with it actually my advisor another classmate of mine and me be talk the other day about put just one detector on one of the pluto satellite then we realize that the satellite alone be only carry something like pound of eq well a batse detector need lead shield to protect it and alone weigh about pound itself we decide against it jeremy
