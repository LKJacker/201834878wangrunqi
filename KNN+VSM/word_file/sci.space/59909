from leech jon leech subject space faq upcoming planetary probe archive-name last-modified date upcoming planetary probe mission and schedule information on upcoming or currently active mission not mention below would be welcome source nasa fact sheet cassini mission design team launch schedule pres kit asuka astro-d isa japan x-ray astronomy satellite launch into earth orbit on equipped with large-area wide-wavelength angstrom x-ray telescope x-ray ccd camera and image ga scintillation proportional counter cassini saturn orbiter and titan atmosphere probe cassini be a joint project design to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian system with it cassini saturn orbiter and huygen titan probe cassini be schedule for launch aboard a titan in october of after gravity assist of venu earth and jupiter in a vvejga trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of upon arrival the cassini spacecraft perform several maneuver to achieve an orbit around saturn near the end of thi initial orbit the huygen probe separate from the orbiter and descend through the atmosphere of titan the orbiter relay the probe datum to earth for about hour while the probe enter and traverse the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter continue tour the saturnian system for three and a half year titan synchronou orbit trajectory will allow about flyby of titan and target flyby of iapetu dione and enceladu the objective of the mission be threefold conduct detail study of saturn atmosphere ring and magnetosphere conduct close-up study of saturn satellite and characterize titan atmosphere and surface one of the most intrigue aspect of titan be the possibility that it surface may be cover in part with lake of liquid hydrocarbon that result from photochemical process in it upper atmosphere these hydrocarbon condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titan cloud and determine if there be liquid on the surface experiment aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical process that produce thi unique atmosphere the cassini mission be name for jean dominique cassini the first director of the pari observatory who discover several of saturn satellite and the major division in it ring the titan atmospheric entry probe be name for the dutch physicist christiaan huygen who discover titan and first describe the true nature of saturn ring key scheduled date for the cassini mission vvejga trajectory titan launch venu gravity assist venu gravity assist earth gravity assist jupiter gravity assist saturn arrival titan probe release titan probe entry end of primary mission schedule last update galileo jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe in transit ha return the first resolve image of an asteroid gaspra while in transit to jupiter effort to unfurl the stick high-gain antenna hga have essentially be abandon jpl ha develop a backup plan use datum compression jpeg-like for image lossles compression for datum from the other instrument which should allow the mission to achieve approximately of it original objective galileo schedule launch from space shuttle venu flyby venu datum playback earth flyby high gain antenna unfurled asteroid belt passage asteroid gaspra flyby earth flyby asteroid belt passage asteroid ida flyby probe separation orbiter deflection maneuver orbital tmy of jovian moon encounter ganymede ganymede callisto europa ganymede europa europa jupiter magnetotail exploration hiten japanese isa lunar probe launch ha make multiple lunar flyby released hagoromo a smaller satellite into lunar orbit thi mission make japan the third nation to orbit a satellite around the moon magellan venu radar map mission ha map almost the entire surface at high resolution currently collect a global gravity map mar observer mar orbiter include resolution camera launched on a titan booster mo be currently in transit to mar arrive on operation will start for one martian year day joint earth observe satellite launch on an ariane booster the primary objective of the project be to make precise and accurate global observation of the sea level for several year substantially increase understand of global ocean dynamic the satellite also will increase understand of how heat be transport in the ocean ulyss european space agency probe to study the sun from an orbit over it pole launched in late it carry particles-and-field experiment such a magnetometer ion and electron collector for variou energy range plasma wave radio receiver etc but no camera since no human-built rocket be hefty enough to send ulyss far out of the ecliptic plane it go to jupiter instead and steal energy from that planet by slide over jupiter north pole in a gravity-assist manuver in february thi bend it path into a solar orbit tilt about degree to the ecliptic it will pa over the sun south pole in the summer of it aphelion be au and surprisingly it perihelion be about au that right a solar-study spacecraft that alway further from the sun than the earth be while in jupiter neigborhood ulyss study the magnetic and radiation environment for a short summary of these result see science v p september for gory technical detail see the many article in the same issue other space science mission note thi be base on a post by ron baalke in with information contribute by yoshiro yamada yamada i attempt to track change base on update shuttle manifest correction and update be welcome mission o alexi spring pegasu alexi array of low-energy x-ray imaging sensor be to perform a wide-field sky survey in the soft low-energy x-ray spectrum it will scan the entire sky every six month to search for variation in soft-x-ray emission from source such a white dwarf cataclysmic variable star and flare star it will also search nearby space for such exotic object a isolate neutron star and gamma-ray burster alexi be a project of lo alamo national laboratory and be primarily a technology development mission that use astrophysical source to demonstrate the technology contact project investigator jeffrey j bloch jjb for more information o wind aug deltum ius rocket satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere o space radar lab sep gather radar image of earth surface o total ozone mapping spectrometer dec pegasu rocket study of stratospheric ozone o sfu space flyer unit isa conducting space experiment and observation and thi can be recover after it conduct the variou scientific and engineer experiment sfu be to be launch by isa and retrieve by the space shuttle on in o polar auroral plasma physic may deltum ius rocket june measure solar wind and

on the precise mechanism of space structure and in-space astronomical observation of electromagnetic wave lunar-a isa elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the moon interior proposed mission o advanced x-ray astronomy facility axaf possible launch from shuttle in axaf be a space observatory with a high resolution telescope it would orbit for year and study the mystery and fate of the universe o earth observing system eo possible launch in of u orbit space platform to provide long-term datum year of earth system science include planetary evolution o mercury observer possible launch o lunar observer possible launch would be send into a long-term lunar orbit the observer from mile above the moon pole would survey characteristic to provide a global context for the result from the apollo program o space infrared telescope facility possible launch by shuttle in thi be the element of the great observatory program a free-flying observatory with a lifetime of to year it would observe new comet and other primitive body in the outer solar system study cosmic birth formation of galaxy star and planet and distant infrared-emitting galaxy o mar rover sample return mrsr robotic rover would return sample of mar atmosphere and surface to earch for analysi possible launch date for image orbiter for rover o fire and ice possible launch in will use a gravity assist flyby of earth in and use a final gravity assist from jupiter in where the probe will split into it fire and ice component the fire probe will journey into the sun take measurement of my star upper
