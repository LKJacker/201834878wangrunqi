from henry henry spencer subject re satellite around pluto mission in article nsmca write is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to keep watch there would be some point to do long-term monitor of thing like particle and field not to mention atmospheric phenomenon however there be no particular plan to establish any sort of monitor network to be precise there be no particular plan period thi be a large part of the problem in thi context it not surprise that unexciting but useful mission like thi get short shrift at budget time the closest approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitor mission be the occasional chance to piggyback something like thi on top of a flashier mission like galileo or cassini how about a mission unman to pluto to stay in orbit and record thing around and near and on pluto it be most unlikely that there be much happen on pluto that would be worth monitor and it be a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology something the planetary community ha firmly resist be the guinea pig for the combine need to arrive at pluto within a reasonable amount of time and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit be beyond what can reasonably be do with current that be propulsion it could do some scan of not only pluto but also of the solar system object near and aaroundpluto a well a setus and look at the galaxy without have much of the solar system to worry about most of thi can be do just about a well from earth the few thing that ca be can be do better from a voyager-like spacecraft that be not constrain by the need to enter orbit around a planet resemble a high-speed collision henry spencer u of toronto zoology between and suno dick dunn henry utzoo henry
