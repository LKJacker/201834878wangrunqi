from palmer david m palmer subject re gamma ray burster positional stuff henry henry spencer write in article belgarath write actually my advisor another classmate of mine and me be talk the other day about put just one detector on one of the pluto satellite then we realize that the satellite alone be only carry something like pound of eq well a batse detector need lead shield to protect it and alone weigh about pound itself actually the situation be even worse than that the total ma of the pluto fast flyby spacecraft be only pound and most of that be support equipment like power and communication the ma available for instrument be maybe of that i do think a batse will fit from the pluto fast flyby instrument definition research anouncemnet the instrument payload constraint be mas allocation kilogram lb power allocation watt required instrument visible image system ccd mm fl optic ir map spectrometer hgcdte array energy resolution uv spectrometer nm nm resolution radio science ultrastable oscilator incorporate in telecom system ultrastable mean thi do leave much room for payload which be totally unrelated to the mission of the spacecraft in addition the power will come from a radioisotope thermal generator and the whole space craft will be about foot in diameter with no boom which mean there will be strong gamma-line from and associate schmutz in the background which tend to reduce sensitivity somewhat it would still be nice and my group here at goddard be look in to it david m palmer palmer palmer
