from ajjb andrew broderick subject re solar sail datum in article snydefj write i be look for any information concern project involve solar sail i wa at an interest seminar at work uk space science dept on thi subject specifically on a small-scale solar sail propose a a student space project the guy give the talk wa keen to generate interest in the project i typein the handout he give out at the meet here go the microlight solar sail introduction the solar sail be a well-established concept harnessing the pressure of sunlight a spacecraft would have unlimited range in principle such a vehicle could explore the whole solar system with zero fuel consumption however it be more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most person realize the pressure of sunlight be only about one kilogram per square kilometer deploying and control the large area of aluminize fabric which would be necessary to transport a type spacecraft be a daunt task thi be why despite the potential of hte idea no such craft ha actually be launch to date recent advance in microelectronic make possible a different concept a tiny sail just a few metre in diameter which could be control purely be electronic with no mechanical part several attitude control method be feasible for example the pressure sunlight exert on a panel of solar cell vary accord to whether power be be draw the key component of the craft will be a minute ccd camera develop at edinburgh university which can act a both attitude sensor and datum gather device solar cell provide watt power for control and communication and a directional radio antenna etch onto the surface of the sail itself launched a a piggyback payload the total cost of the mission can be limit to a few ten of thousand of dollar the craft would be capable of some ambitiou mission for example a it could rendezvou with a nearby asteroid from the apollo or amor group closeup picture could be transmit back to earth at a low bite rate b it could be steer into a lunar polar orbit previously unobserved area around the lunar pole could be view by angle the sail to reflect sunlight downward polar crater whose basis never receive sunlight could be image bright reflection would confirm that volatile such a water ice have become trap in these location immensely valuable information for set up a man lunar base btw c it could be send to rendezvou with a small asteroid or comet nucleu impacting at low speed a thin wire probe attach to the craft cause it to rebound while capture a tiny sample be a sharp-edged tube like perform a biopsy returning to earth the sail act a an ideal re-entry parachute load per unit area ensure that heat be reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature can not exceed deg c the material sample be recover enclose in a small insulate container contact colin jack tel oxford mathematical design high street oxford england thi guy would love to hear from anyone interest in thi project or seek detail or anything and would be most happy to send you more information andy andy jonathan j broderick i have come that they might have rutherford lab uk life and have it to the full mail ajjb jesu christ
