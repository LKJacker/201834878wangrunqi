from prb pat subject re space manuevering tug wa hst service mission in article josh hopkin write prb pat write given that what i describe for the hst seem to be the smt and give the ma amrgin on the discovery mission be tight enough that spacewalk ha to be carefully constrain no edo pallet no spare suit no extra mmu ha someone actually verify that ma be the predominant constraint on thi mission you seem to be assume it without give support evidence someone from nasa post that there be very significant ma margin on the hst re-boost mission a while back i have ask why not carry the edo pallet up and the answer wa the ma margin be tight enough they be even carry extra suit why not do thi quick test goldin philosophjy of faster cheaper better build a real fast space tug to handle the re-boost of the hst use clean cryo fuel and get it ready before the hst mission pat thi would be slower more expensive and worse slower the shuttle mission be schedule to go up in december that le than eight month away there be no way you could build new hardware retrain and reschedule the eva in that time where wingo when you need him come on knock that off you forget that during skylab they do overnight mission plan for the repair eva also during the intelsat mission they do overnight wetf simulation i somehow think they could train up a new eva in month and a for build hardware anything can be build if you want it bad enough you forget the bu be already build all they ahve to do be soup it up even test it on a deltum mission do get into thi mode of negativism beside at the rate mission slip the discovery wo launch on thi mission until march that almost a year more expensive ymy proposal still require the shuttle to do everything it wa go to do execpt fire the om in addition you add significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware ah but how much more expensive be the second hst service mission you forget there be a bum fg the solar array electronic be get hinky and there be still month until the service mission the time for the space walk be grow rapidly thi wa orignally plan out a spacewalk now they be at eva with reserve walk if the smt can avoid a second service mission that million save if the weight save mean they can sit on orbit for day and handle any contingency problem that quite a save according to a gao report on the omv i have before me there be only two currently plan mission that could use such a vehicle hst and axaf since axaf ha since be scale back and hst can rely on the shuttle there do seem to be any need for ymy vehicle of course there wa any need for the saturn v after apollo too a for the problem with the aperture door i be sure they can work out some way to handle that maybe a plug make from frozen ice it keep out any contamination yet sublime away after teh boost pat
