from kjenk subject space station redesign jsc alternative i have mb worth uuencode gif image contain chart outline one of the many alternative space station design be consider in crystal city mr mark holderman work down the hall from me and can be reach for comment at or vium e-mail at mholderm mark propose thi design which he call geode rough on the outside but a gem on the inside or the et strongback with integrate hab module and centrifuge a you can see from file it use a space shuttle external tank et in place of much of the trus which be currently part of space station freedom the white track on the outside of the et be use by the station remonte manipulator system srm and by the reaction control system rc pod thi allow the rc pod to move along the track so that thrust can occur near the center of gravity cg of the station a the ma property of the station change during assembly the inline module design allow the shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the station cg and at a structurally strong part of the station in the current ssf design dock force be limit to pound which seriously constrain the design of the dock system the et would have a hatch instal pre-flight with little additional launch ma we alway have the ability to put an et into orbit contrary to some rumor which have circulate here but we never have a reason to do it while we have have some good reason not to performance penalty control debris generation and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint once on-orbit we would vent the residual the et insulation sofi either a erode on-orbit from impact with atomic oxygen or b stay where it be and we deploy a kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminate the local space environment option b ha the advantage of provide further micrometeor protection the et be incredibly strong remember it support the whole stack during launch and could serve a the nucleu for a much more ambitiou design a budget permit the white module at the end of et contain a set of control moment gyro to be use for attitude control while the rc will be use for gyro desaturation the module also contain a de-orbit system which can be use at the end of the station life to perform a control de-orbit so we do kill any more kangaroo like we do with skylab the centrifuge which ha the same volume a a hab module could be use for long-term study of the effect of lunar or martian gravity on human the centrifuge will be use a a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system the centrifuge be mount on one of the module opposite the et and the solar panel thi design use most of the exist ssf design for electrical datum and communication system get leverage from the ssf work do to date mark propose thi design at joe shea committee in crystal city and he report that he wa warmly receive however the rumor i hear say that a design base on a wingles space shuttle orbiter seem more likely please note that thi text be my interpretation of mark design you should see hi note in the gif file instead of post a mb file to i try to post these for anon-ftp in but it wa out of storage space i let you all know when i get that do ken jenk space shuttle program office kjenk development of the space station be a inevitable a the rise of the sun wernher von braun
