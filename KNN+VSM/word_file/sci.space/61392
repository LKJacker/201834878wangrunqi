from dietz paul dietz subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article kwp kevin w plaxco write resolve power of the optic batse be an altogether different beast effectively just coincidence counter one on each corner of the craft positional information be triangulate from the differential signal arrival time at each of the detector obviously not count rate be too low and signal rise time too long for thi to be possible the cgro be what meter long you need to time to an accuracy of nanosecond to do thi what batse actually do be measure the relative strength in each of the detector also a a function of photon energy each of the detector do not have isotropic response to do thi right one must model the scatter of photon in the material around each detector and even scatter of photon off the earth atmosphere back onto the spacecraft i believe they have now reduce the error to about degree paul f dietz dietz
