from henry henry spencer subject re temperature of the dark sky in article mosis julie mosis write radiation field ha be measure and model by variou group if i remember thing correctly the model involve contribution from three different bb source so there no obviou temperature of background radiation in my local area indeed the sky do look much like a black body if you look carefully enough in particular it temperature at radio frequency be quite a bite higher than you would see from a black body morgan gordon fat communication satellite handbook ha a graph of sky temperature v wavelength in fact for communication design however in term of energy content the rf frequency be negligible for thermal purpose at very large distance from the sun the sky look like a black body at allen astrophysical quantity i have find a number for non-large distance since solar radiation tend to be something you ca just ignore but m g say about in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominate the problem resemble a high-speed collision henry spencer u of toronto zoology between and suno dick dunn henry utzoo henry
