from eder dani eder subject re gun for space okay let get the record straight on the livermore ga gun the project manager be dr john hunter and he work for the laser group at livermore what you may ask do ga gun have to do with laser nothing really but the gun be physically locate acros the road from the free electron laser build and the fel build ha a heavily shield control room thick wall from which the gun fire be control so i suspect that the office he work for be an administrative convenience i visit hunter at the begin of feb and we tour the gun at the time i wa work on ga gun r d at boeing where i work but i be now do other thing help to save the space station the gun use a methane-air mixture which be burn in a chamber about ft long by inch id it look like a pipe the chamber hold a ton piston which be propel at several hundred down the chamber on the other side of the piston be hudrogen ga initially at room temperature andsome ten of atmosphere the piston compress and heat the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainles steel burst diaphragm rupture at around psi the barrel of the gun be about foot long and ha a inch bore it be mount at right angle to the chamber they intersect thi wa do so that in the future the barrel could be raise and the gun fire into the air without have to move the larger and heavier chamber the projectile be use in test be a kg cylinder of lexan plastic in in diameter and about cm long all of the acceleration come from the expansion of the hydrogen ga from psi downward until the projectile leaf the barrel the barrel be evacuate and the end be seal with a sheet of plastic film a little thicker than saran wrap the plastic be blow off by the small amount of residual air trap in the barrel ahead of the projectile the gun be fire into a bunker fill with sandbag and plastic water jug in the early test fragment of the plastic projectile be find at the higher speed in later test the projectile vaporize the test be into a bunker because the livermore test range be about mile acros and the projectile would go km if fire for maximum range the intent be to move the whole gun to vandenberg afb after the test be complete where they can fire into the pacific ocean and use the track radar at vafb to follow the projectile the design goal of the gun be to throw a kg projectile at half of orbital speed so far they have reach and the gun be currently down for repair a on the last test they blow a seal and damage some of the hardware i think it have to do with the methane-air more detonate than burn but i have have a chance to talk to hunter directly on thi there be person wait to test scramjet component in thi gun by fire then out of the gun into the air at mach since the most you can get in wind tunnel be mach thi gun cost about million to develop and be basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of fire useful size payload into space thi would require on the order of kg projectile which deliver on the order of kg useful payload to orbit dani eder dani investment company w h box athen al n w alt
