from graydon saundrsg subject re what if the ussr have reach the moon first in article gary gary coffman say in article graydon saundrsg write thi be turn into a moonbase good for and i ought not to post when i a hundred some odd post to go but i would think that the real reason to have a moon base be economic since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much larger gnp than they would without space industry eventually they will simply be able to afford more stuff if i read you right you say in essence that with a larger economy nation will have more discretionary fund to waste on a lunar facility that wa certainly partially the case with apollo but real lunar colony will probably require a continue military scientific or commercial reason for be rather than just a we have the money why not approach i wa assume that there wo be a moon base unles it make a profit actually if it do well that gife a larger gnp which lead to be able to spend more money on ymy military include gosh-wow space stuff assume it profitable rather than pay for itself it conceivable that luna will have a military purpose it possible that luna will have a commercial purpose but it most likely that luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred year at least therefore lunar basis should be predicate on fund level little different from those find for antarctic basis can you put a person base on the moon for million a year even if you use grad student you might be able to run one for that put it there hardly why do you think at least a couple century before there will be significant commerical activity on the moon graydon
