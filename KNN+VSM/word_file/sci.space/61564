from thomsonal subject drag-free satellite on sat may gmt henry henry spencer say no a dragles satellite do not magically have no drag it burn fuel constantly to fight drag maintain the exact orbit it would have if there wa no drag well almost it turn out that clever orbital mechanic can engineer thing so that resonant interaction with the higher order harmonic of the earth gravitational field can pump energy into a satellite and keep it from experience drag effect for period of month to year my favorite example of thi be the heavy elint satellite of the cosmo clas which be in resonance in particular ha undergo two period of prolong gain in altitude the current one have start in june the mean altitude of the satellite be now a high a it ha ever be since launch on march looking at the element for also show the limitation of norad software but that another story thi probably ha little relevance to space station since the degree orbit of the satellite be at km which be unacceptably far into the inner van allen belt for man platform but it kind of interest from the point of view of the physic of the situation orbital element for these satellite be available on request allen thomson saic mclean va is there an opinion here if so it mine not saic
