from mark bradford subject frequently seen acronym archive-name edition acronym list for and edition dec last post aug thi list be offer a a reference for translate commonly appear acronym in the space-related newsgroup if i forget or botch ymy favorite acronym please let me know also if there an acronym not on thi list that confuse you drop me a line and if i can figure it out i add it to the list note that thi be intend to be a reference for frequently see acronym and be most emphatically not encyclopedic if i incorporate every acronym i ever saw i soon run out of disk space the list will be post at regular interval every day all comment regard it be welcome i reachable a note that thi just tell what the acronym stand for you on ymy own for figure out what they mean note also that the total number of acronym in use far exceed what i can list special-purpose acronym that be essentially alway explain a they introduce be omit further some acronym stand for more than one thing a of edition of the list these acronym appear on multiple line unles they simply different way of refer to the same thing thank to everybody who send suggestion since the first version of the list and especially to garrett a wollman wollman who be maintain an independent list somewhat more verbose in character than mine and to daniel fischer dfi who be maintain a truly huge list at last count of acronym and term mostly in german which i read fortunately special thank thi time to ken holli at nasa who send me a copy of nasa reference publication revised space transportation system and associated payload glossary acronym and abbreviation a truly mammoth tome almost page of tla special bonu at the end of thi post you will find a perl program write by none other than larry wall whose purpose be to scramble the acronym list in an entertain fashion thank larry a a astronomy and astrophysic aao anglo-australian observatory aa american astronomical society aa american astronautical
