from pgf phil g fraering subject re gamma ray burster where be they belgarath write catalog these test all show that the burst have an isotropic distribution evenly spread out in a radial direction and they show sign of homogeneity they do not clump in any one direction so unles we be sample the area inside the disk of the galaxy we be sample the universe not cool if you want to figure out what the hell cause these thing now i suppose you be say well we stil only may be sample from inside the disk well not necessarily remember we have what be more or le an interplanetary network of burst detector with a baseline that go waaaay out to beyond pluto pioneer so we should be able with all of my detector de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite here an analogy you see a plane overhead you measure the angle of the plane from the origin of ymy arbitrary coordinate system one of ymy friend a mile away see the same plane and measure the angle from the zero point of hi arbitrary system which be the same a your the two angle be different and you should be able to triangulate the position of ymy burst and maybe find a source to my knowledge no one ha be able to do thi uh no these burst detector be just that burst detector they have no angular resolution now a network of burst detector could have angular resolution but we do not have a decent set of different network at the distance neccesary from each other to determine if they happen in the oort cloud or not we have one network and try to make two network out of it degrade what angular resolution we have phil fraering seem like every day we find out all sort of stuff pgf how the ancient mayan have televison repo man
