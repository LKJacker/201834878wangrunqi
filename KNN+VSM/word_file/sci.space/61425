from tstroup subject re long term space voyange and effect newsgroup in article khayash ken hayashida write the first item of busines be to establish the importance space life science in the whole of scheme of humankind i mean compare to football and baseball the average joe schmoe do seem interest or even curiou about spaceflight i disagree it think the average joe be about spaceflight but see it a an elitist activity not one which he be ever go to participate in all of u in my own way can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be release to the general public around the world the document would scientifically analyze the technical aspect of long term human habitation in space why be the general public go to be interest in the technical detail of long term space habitation i like the idea of the study but it should be release to other scientist and engineer who will be able to use it if you want a general public document you need a more general publication i believe that if any long-term space exploration program be to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer my own microworld the spacecraft only through the careful analysis of engineer chemical biological and medical factor will a good ecosystem be create to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight a one work on controlled ecological life support system engineer the microworld be the problem the problem be understand the basic chemical biological and medical factor to be able to engineer them efficiently for example the only way we know how to produce food be from plant and animal food synthesi be not very far advance so we have to orbit a farm well that obviously not very efficient so we use technology to reduce the ma and grow plant hydroponically instead of use dirt thi be where the engineer come in but new technology bring new basic question that we do have the answer to like in dirt we can grow tomato and lettuce right beside each other but in hydroponic it turn out that you ca do that the lettuce growth be stunt when it grow in the same hydroponic solution a tomato so now you have to consider what other plant be go to have similar interaction thi mean some basic apply scientific research and that what need to be do with all technology that have be develop so far we also need to find out how they interact together that where we be now so i would like to see post of opinion regard the most objective method to analyze the accept scientific literature for technology which can be apply to long-duration spaceflight first you need to do the literature search there be a lot of information out there maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation thi could be useful especially if we make it available on the net then we can look at method of analyze the technology such a detail literature search would be of interest to ourself a space advocate and clearly important to exist space program in essence we would be divide the space life science issue into variou technical problem which could be solve with variou technology thi database of acceptable solution to variou problem could form the basi of detail discussion involve person from the bionet isunet and any other source unles there be an unbelievable outpouring of interest on thi on the net i think we should develop a detail datum base of the literature search first then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysi the datum base itself could be useful for future engineer that my response ken what do you think tim
