from steinly steinn sigurdsson subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article ethanb ethan bradford write in article steinly steinn sigurdsson write the problem with oort cloud source be that absolutely no plausible mechanism ha be propose it would have to involve new physic a far a i can tell closest to conventional oort source be a model of b-field pinch by comet it get too many hole in it to count but at least it wa a good try so you have a plausible model for grb at astronomical distance i do have any plausible model for grb at any distance recent observation have just about rule out the merge neutron star hypothesi which have a lot of problem anyhow we have to look for implausible model and what be fundamentally allow independent of model hmm the superbowl burst ha be claim in pres release to cast doubt on the merge n hypothesi from what i read and i have see the paper only the pres i say it be consistent with some of the merge n model a paper on the possibility of grb in the oort cloud just come through the astrophysic abstract service to get a copy of thi here be the abstract of that paper indicator to these event all possible source which be isotropically distribute should remain under consideration thi be why the oort cloud of comet be keep on the list although there be no know mechanism for generate grb from cometary nucleus unlikely a it may seem the possibility that grb originate in the solar cometary cloud can not be exclude until it be disprove thi do not propose a mechanism for grb in the oort and no anti-matter annihilation do not fit the spectrum at least a far a i understand annihilation spectrum big difference that ignore the question of how you fit a distribution to the oort distribution when the oort distribution be not well know in particular comet aphelium which be not well know be not a good measure of the oort cloud distribution steinn sigurdsson lick observatory steinly standard disclaimer the law of gravity be very very strict and you just bend them for ymy own benefit
