from david b mckissock subject nasa wrap in the april edition of one small step for a space activist allen sherzer tim kyger write another problem be what be call or sometime the tax when work for a large program like freedom or shuttle be perform at a nasa center the center skim off a portion which go into what amount to a slush fund thi money be use to fund work the center manager want to fund thi sum be estimate to be over a third of the fund allocate think about that of the billion cost of freedom fully billion wo be spend on anything have anything to do with space station now maybe that billion wa wisely spend and maybe it wa but the work do with it should stand on it own merit not distort the cost of other project congres ha no idea of the existense of these wrap congres ha never hear the term tax they look at the station they be get and the price they be pay and note that it do add up they wonder thi blissfully unaware that a third of the money be go for something else my dear friend ymy mix fact and fiction here a couple of week ago when i first read thi in ymy post i talk with one of the cost expert here in space station at headquarters if you wonder why i do post a response immediately i do have a real job i suppose to be do here at headquarters dig up old khz datum look into claim rate pretty low on the totem pole of priority also i spend last weekend in kansa city at the national science teacher association conference extol the virtue of ssf to science teacher first off ye the concept of tax or do exist if i recall the number correctly the total for the ssf program for thi fiscal year be around million thi wa compute by add up the and center with the ssf budget for thi fiscal year at billion my calculater say the tax percentage be over the life of the ssf program use ymy figure of billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a rate come to million thi be alot le than billion but i will concede it still an appreciable amount of pocket change i should note that ymy estimate of the tax rate at could be close to the actual rate the tax be only charge on fund that be spend at the center kind of like mcdonald at some state where you do have to pay sale tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you do if you get it take-out for example at the vast bulk of the fund we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and be not subject to the center tax i do have the number in front of me but i gues at least of the fund go to rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax rate of but it only apply to fund spend at the center and not to the prime contract thi lead to the obviou question what be the government do with ssf fund that do go to the prime contractor ok get a slouse of the billion pie a big portion of thi slouse go to rocketdyne what happen to the balance of the fund which be eat up by the center tax at we call these fund we spend in-house support development fund a they be support the development work do by rocketdyne we have use these fund to setup my own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture my testbed ha a real life solar array field leave over from solar cell research research a few year back with lead-acid car battery to simulate the nickel-hydrogen battery on ssf dc switchgear dc-dc converter unit and simulate load datum from the testbed wa use in a recent change evaluation involve concern about the stability of the power system we have also use the support development money to purchase nickel hydrogen battery which be on life test at both lewi and the crane naval facility in indiana a a side point of the battery cell on test recently hit the fmy year life test milestone cell have complete to cycle the on-orbit battery go through cycle per year a a final example my division at lewi use the support development fund to purchase personal computer and work station for perform system analysis like model of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculation use a monte-carlo simulation set up a database with information on weight of the power system element finally the money raise by the do not all go into a fund at lewi the director do control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewi can submit a proposal to the director to get money from thi fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewi charter most of the tax however go to fund the service at the center like the library the central computer service division the contractor who remove the snow etc thu it be rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget do go for ssf activity to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library fund use to support ssf which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for year be to ssf would you base it on the person-hour ssf employee spend read av-week versu the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare thi estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that go to support the library who know maybe ssf overpay on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a burecratic nightmare my last point be that i ca believe ymy claim that congres ha never hear of the term tax unfortunately all of the nasa testimony before congres be on a computer so i ca do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong but surely in some gao audit somewhere these nasa cost method be document for congres
