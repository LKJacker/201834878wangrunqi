from prb pat subject re space manuevering tug wa hst service mission in article josh hopkin write prb pat write i write prb pat write my datum show that the om engine hold kg of propellant of that a substantial fraction be go to be use for the first om burn the reentry burn and the reserve so pat tell u how much fuel the altitude change be go to take and how much the edo pallet and extra part be go ma if you can make the number work out then i be interest after you show u that it can be do then tell u how much the edo pallet and extra equipment be go to cost i do know do anyone in nasa land know how much fuel be budget for the altitude change henry any figure on the ma full for the edo pallet plu it dry weight how about for the dry ma of it wa be de-classified a i check last also i need current orbital parameter of hst project orbital parameter after re-boost discovery dry weight hst dry weight i somehow think they could train up a new eva in month first while astronaut certainly have do eva with minimal plan that wa because they have to they do like to do that a a general rule so how long do they need to train a year year somehow i think moth should be adequate second remember why they have to improvise during intelsat they be try to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wa design to do that trying to shortcut the train be only go to make a repeat more likely also because they significantly lack on-orbit eva experience the hst be design for on-orbit service it should be a lot easier third they do have eight month they have however much time be leave after someone come up with a plan show it can work and get it approve you may think i have a pessimistic attitude i think it realistic i not say that the engineer task be impossible few engineer task be what i say be that thi be neither cost effective nor feasible under nasa management there come a time in every project to kill the management they can if neccessary re-schedule the hst mission december be not a drop dead date unlike say the ldef retrieval mission all they have to do be soup it up just what do that mean i suspect the may not have enough basic thrust for the hst re-boost it mayu need bigger tank or bigger thruster my understand be the second hst service mission be not a contingency my understand be the mission need both a new foc and work on the electrical system plu another re-boost if the smt can avoid a second service mission that million save no pat that million minu the cost of the new hardware minu the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along minu development and mangement cost minu extra operate cost tanstaafl somehow i think the cost of an expendable smt will be le then million and the extra stuff be real cheap nasa ha lot of suit mmu and the edo pallet be re-usable oh one double magnum of champagne now there a couple hundred buck pat not only be thi messy and le reliable than a device that make to perform thi task it also ignore the point there be a desire to have astronaut available so that if the door fail to open something can be do about it unles you can provide a very reliable way of reopen the door you have solve the problem that door ha cycle x time already once after massive g load i somehow think they can work ou reliability method to ensure the door work also please tell me how some sort of sublimate material like or would manage to contaminate the mirror anything that go to vapor state should adhere to the mirror somehow the door problem can be work maybe they can put a one time spring on it what do they do now if the door hang up that door be part of a intrument safing mechanism if it hang up tomorrow it be month until someone get up there witha crowbar to fix it pat
