from leech jon leech subject space faq mission schedule archive-name last-modified date space shuttle answer launch schedule tv coverage shuttle launching and landing schedule and how to see them shuttle operation be discuss in the usenet group and ken holli gandalf post a compress version of the shuttle manifest launch date and other information periodically there the manifest be also available from the ame space archive in the portion of hi manifest formerly include in thi faq ha be remove please refer to hi post or the archive copy for the most up to date information on upcoming mission call at kennedy space center official nasa shuttle statu report be post to frequently why do the shuttle roll just after liftoff the follow answer and translation be provide by ken jenk kjenk the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc g c say during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude be command until an i-loaded v rel sufficient to assure launch tower clearance be achieve then the tilt maneuver roll program orient the vehicle to a head down attitude require to generate a negative q-alpha which in turn alleviate structural load other advantage with thi attitude be performance gain decrease abort maneuver complexity improve s-band look angle and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver be also require to start gain downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target in second stage thi really be a good answer but it couch in nasa jargon i try to interpret we wait until the shuttle clear the tower before roll then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind cause by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the wing the imaginary line between the lead edge and the trail edge be a slightly negative angle a negative q-alpha thi cause a little bite of downward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z direction and thi force alleviate structural load we have to be careful about those wing they about the most delicate part of the vehicle the new attitude after the roll also allow u to carry more ma to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same ma or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we do roll performance gain the new attitude allow the crew to fly a le complicate flight path if they have to execute one of the more dangerou abort maneuver the return to launch site decrease abort maneuver complexity the new attitude improve the ability for ground-based radio antenna to have a good line-of-sight signal with the s-band radio antenna on the orbiter improve s-band look angle the new attitude allow the crew to see the horizon which be a helpful but not mandatory part of pilot any fly machine the new attitude orient the shuttle so that the body be more nearly parallel with the grind and the nose to the east usually thi allow the thrust from the engine to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity be a vector quantity make of both speed and direction the shuttle ha to have a large horizontal component to it velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit thi all beg the question why be the launch pad orient to give thi nice attitude to begin with why do the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer be that the pad be leftover from the apollo day the shuttle straddle two flame trench one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effect of thi on any daytime launch the srm exhaust be dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust be fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the acces tower and other support and service structure be all orient basically the same way they be for the saturn v a side note the saturn v also have a roll program do ask me why i a shuttle guy i check with a buddy in ascent dynamic he add that the roll maneuver be really a maneuver in all three axe roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver be perform for the reason state the pitch component control load on the wing by keep the angle of attack q-alpha within a tight tolerance the yaw component be use to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver be really express a a quaternion a grad-level-math concept for combine all three rotation matrix in one four-element array how to receive the nasa tv channel nasa select nasa select be broadcast by satellite if you have acces to a satellite dish you can find select on satcom transponder c-band degree west longitude audio frequency mhz be station over the atlantic and be increasingly difficult to receive from californium and point west during event of special interest shuttle mission select be sometime broadcast on a second satellite for these viewer if you ca get a satellite fee some cable operator carry select it worth ask if your do the select schedule be find in the nasa headline news which be frequently post to generally it carry pres conference brief by nasa official and live coverage of shuttle mission and planetary encounter select ha recently begin carry much more secondary material associate with spacelink when mission be not be cover amateur radio frequency for shuttle mission the follow be believe
