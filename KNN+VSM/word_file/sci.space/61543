from isaackuo isaac kuo subject re electrical spacecraft vium magnetic field of earth in article nsmca write okay the earth ha a magnetic field unles someone miss something okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field it produce electricty no if you put a conductor in a change magnetic field it produce a voltage the two way you can do that with a permanent magnet be to move the magnet or move the conductor the slow shift of the earth magnetic field be really significant especially when you consider how weak the earth magnetic field be to begin with now the question can you use electricity to power a earth orbit vehicle and i fyou can can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power it well it would require generate an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the earth magnetic field a a magnet can repel another magnet of course thi force only work in one direction and the magnetic field generate ha to be unimaginably powerful magnetic repulsion drop off a and the earth magnetic field on the surface be already very weak it would require some sort of unknown superconductor and special nonmagnetic construction and seriously hardenned electronic optical computer perhap and the physiological danger would be significant due to the iron content in my blood among other thing in other word forget it can the idea of a dragles satellite be use in part to create the electrical field after all the dragles satellite be i might be wrong a suspend between to pilon the the pilon compensate for drag i think i know what i want to say just not sure how to say it a dragles satellite sound interestingly enough liek a generator i miss out on the dragles satellite thread but it sound totally bogu from thi little bite isaac kuo isaackuo o twinkle twinkle little sig keep it le than line big
