from henry henry spencer subject re japanese moon land in article rl write allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditure of fuel to slow down the idea be that object sometime get capture without expend fuel we just find the trajectory that make it possible the originator of the technique say that nasa wa interest but that japan wa because their probe wa small and could hold a lot of fuel for deceleration actually hiten wa originally intend to go into lunar orbit at all so it indeed do have much fuel on hand the lunar-orbit mission wa an afterthought after hagoromo a tiny subsatellite deploy by hiten during a lunar flyby have a transmitter failure and it proper insertion into lunar orbit could be positively confirm it should be note that the technique do have disadvantage it take a long time and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit if you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel although it be reduce from what you need for the brute-force approach all work be one man work henry spencer u of toronto zoology kipling henry utzoo henry
