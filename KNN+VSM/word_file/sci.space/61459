from prb pat subject re hst servicing mission scheduled for day in article hathaway write in article prb pat write in article strider greg moore write a herny point out you have to develop the thruster also while much lighter you still have to lift the ma of the thruster to orbit and then the thruster lift it own weight into a higher orbit and you take up room in the payload bay a ye but the improvement in boost orbit to the hst be significant i do not understand what you be say here what be improve what be significant and what do thi have to do with carry more equipment on a service mission also a imply by other poster why do you need to boost the orbit on thi mission anyway maybe you have something here but could you please clarify it for u on the net right now the hst sevicing mission be list a day before it wa list a day they just kick up the number of spacewalk to after simulation indicate that it wa not do-able in after all the space walk they be go to re-boost the hst orbit i think right now it sit at mile up they would like i do know the exact orbit number i know when hst wa first fly it wa place in the highest possible shuttle orbit now the shuttle can cary a thing call the edo pallet or extend duration orbiter pallet it mostly for the fuel cell and rc gear plu more and canister for the life support re-breather maybe more nitrogen too the limit on space-walking be a function of suit supply mas and orbiter duration in order to perform the re-boost of the hst the om engine will be fire for a long period now the shuttle be a heavy thing the hst be light either the amount of om fuel need to fly both up be substantial a small booster carry up and use to boost hst on it own will weigh significantly le then the om fuel require to boost both hst and shuttle for a give orbital change from what i understand the ma margin on the hst mission be tight enough they ca even carry extra suit or mmu now if they use a small tug i would bet just a wild gues that the save on be margin would allow carry the edo pallet extra suit more consumable part for the flaky fg sensor part for the balky solar electronic and still enough for a double magnum of champagne or the hst could even get place into some sort of medium orbit the reason they want a high orbit be le antenna point and longer drag life and that mean you can then carry edo pack and enough consumable so the shuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the array tilt motor and god know what else be go to wear out from what i hear the motor be fine it be one of the two set of electronic that control the motor that need a fix the motor and electronic be separate piece of hardware i expect to be correct if i wrong on thi a whatever it be the problem in the tilt array be a big constraint on hst op pat
