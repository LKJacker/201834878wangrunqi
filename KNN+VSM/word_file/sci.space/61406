from josh hopkin subject re vandalizing the sky i wonder if vandalize be the proper word to use in thi situation my dictionary define vandalism a the willful or maliciou destructuion of public or private property especially of anything beautiful or artisitc i would agree the sky be beautiful but not that it be public or private property i personally prefer natural sky far from city light and san aircraft however there be also something to be say for be able to look up into the sky and see a satellite many person get a real kick out of it especially if they have see one before josh hopkin find a way or make one attribute to hannibal
