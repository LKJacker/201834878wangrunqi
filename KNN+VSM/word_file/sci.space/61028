from hdsteven h d steven subject re in article dennisn denni newkirk write in article jgreen jame thoma green write ha anyone look into the possiblity of a combo what would be the benefit and problem with such a combo other than the obviou instability in the xssr now the centaur for the alta be about meter dium and the proton be so that a good fit for their exist upper stage the block-d which set inside a shround just under meter dium i do know about launch load etc but since the centaur survife titan launch which be probably worse than the proton those titan srb probably shake thing up pretty good it seem feasible except the centaur be a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which be not available now proton be assemble and transport horizontially do anyone know how much stres in the way of a payload a centaur could support while bolt to a proton horizontally and then take down the rail road track and erect on the pad the centaur that be be build for would be a better bet to integrate onto the proton a the be design for the extremely harsh envorinment of the launch it be also closer to m in diameter you hit on the real kicker however the centaur be pressure stabilize it can not hold up it own weight without pressure in the tank additionally the pressure difference between the two tank must be maintain to psi that be rather tight to be rock and roll on the train the pressure stabilization be how centaur achieve the performance on numerou occasion when i wa there the af want to see what it would take to make a non-pressure stabilize centaur the answer a centaur not worth launch the do not require on-pad integration however the do i believe the on-pad integration be to a great extent due to the cleanlines requirement and pfl configuration so maybe something can be do there they would also need lox and lh facility add to the proton pad unles the new proton second stage be actually build and of course any centaur support system and facility no doubt import from the u at great cost these system may viloate u law so there be political problem to solve in addition to the instability in the ci you mention the addition of facility be critical a the centaur top off a it lift off a lhe facility be also need i do know what the proton use for fuel but since they be derive from icbm i would suspect that they use storable propellant which do have the ullage problem that cryo do if there be no cryo at the sight at all the addition of these system could be big not to mention the real tech transfer issue involve with provide centaur gse to russium that issue alone might be enough to kill thi idea steven stanford university email hdsteven aerospace robotic laboratory phone lab durand building bullpen stanford ca fax
