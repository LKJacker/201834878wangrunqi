from mosis julie mosis subject re temperature of the dark sky do anyone have a reference something i can look up not just ymy own recollection i have a few of those myself on the temperature of the night sky a see from space note i be not talk about the temperature of the microwave background radiation there be more thing in the sky than just the mbr what i after be total blackbody temperature what a thermal radiator would see disregard or shield against the sun and nearby large warm object i not sure if thi will help you but the local interstellar radiation field ha be measure and model by variou group if i remember thing correctly the model involve contribution from three different bb source so there no obviou temperature of background radiation in my local area however the follow reference give the interstellar radiation density a a function of wavelength and you can integrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an effective temperature if you like witt and johnson astrophy j henry et al astrophy j mathi et al astron astrophy a you can see the reference be out of date but they might get you start hope thi help julie
