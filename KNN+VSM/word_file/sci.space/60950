from gary gary coffman subject re what if the ussr have reach the moon first in article graydon saundrsg write in article gary gary coffman say it conceivable that luna will have a military purpose it possible that luna will have a commercial purpose but it most likely that luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred year at least therefore lunar basis should be predicate on fund level little different from those find for antarctic basis can you put a person base on the moon for million a year even if you use grad student you might be able to run one for that put it there hardly why do you think at least a couple century before there will be significant commerical activity on the moon wishful think mostly it more likely that the moon will never be the site of major commercial activity a far a we know it ha no material we ca get cheaper right here on earth or from asteroid and comet aside from the semi-mythic that might be useful in low grade fusion reactor exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch and it position in the gravity well of earth couple with it heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for high grind military weapon system but it hold very minute commercial value if space travel become cheap enough it might become a tourist attraction a mt everest and the antarctic have become but that a very minor activity in the global scope of thing luna ha an inconvienent gravity field it likely too low to prevent calcium los muscle atrophy and long term genetic drift yet it too high to do micro-g manufacture space base colony and factory that can be spin to any convienent value of g look much better luna ha a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two week a month but orbital site can have better vacuum and continou solar exposure luna offer a source of light element rock that can serve a raw material heatsink and shield the asteroid and comet offer source of both light and heavy element and volatile compound and many be in le steep gravity well so that le delta-v be require to reach them we do use of the earth now the seafloor and we virtually ignore antarctica a whole continent that because we do have to deal with those condition in order to make a buck luna be a much more expensive place to visit or to live and work i think we use the easier place first that push lunar development back at least a few century if not much longer luna main short term value would be a a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory shield from the noisy earth or a the site of a laser particle beam or linear accelerator weapon system for defend earth or bombard it a the case may be the first be unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument the second be just a unlikely because conventional nuke be good enough and the military would really rather see the earth safe for conventional warfare again there little glory in watch from a bunker a machine fight each other over continental range little ultimate profit either gary gary coffman you make it gatech gary destructive testing system we break it uunet rsiatl gary shannon way guaranteed emory gary lawrenceville ga
