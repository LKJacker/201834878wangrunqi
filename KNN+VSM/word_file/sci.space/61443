from rw ralph wijer subject re gamma ray burster where be they i feel compel to complain the statement that recent observation rule out merge neutron star a source of gamma-ray burst be utterly false even though it be popular enough to make it to batse pres release the idea behind the statement be a follow if you smack two neutron star together or have a neutron star be gobble up by a black hole a lot of energy be release enough for a gamma-ray burst at a cosmological distance but so the reason continue thi energy be release below a lot of matter so the radiation become thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum the observe spectrum be strongly non-thermal so thi model must be wrong a so often the fault ly with the imagination of the person who wa try to prove the model wrong rather than with the model it may be that the initial energy release be not see a a gamma-ray burst but the of energy and matter that be create may spew out a relativistic flow when thi slam into the surround medium a strong flux of non-thermal gamma ray result which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy all thi be not my idea it be in a series of paper by martin ree peter meszaro sorry for the miss accent and co-worker it be certainly not a complete model but it may well be the best one around sum over all propose distance scale an alternative proposal for what create the initial fireball by the way be the so-called supernova scenario by stan woosley in which a very massive star at the end of it life collapse to a black hole if the stellar core wa rotate part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halt because it be support by centrifugal force and form a very dense neutron toru that accrete onto the black hole thi beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axi which again constitute relativistic flow the rate of such event may be much higher than that of neutron star merger but the flux may be more strongly beam so that the net rate of burst observe on earth stay the same between the two scenario but the energy release per event can be a lot le in the fail supernova scenario on another note i do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolve vium some classical astronomical method such a find counterpart to the burst at other wavelength or find a definitive signature of some know clas of object in the distribution of position and flux theorist have historically not be too successfull in find the distance of any object by prove that there be only one possible way in which the object can work and therefore it must be so-and-so ralph wijer
