from willner steve willner subject re temperature of the dark sky in article richmond stupendou man write if that the case let me point out that interstellar dust and molecule provide many instance of thing that be well not-too-far from be blackbody many different observation include ira and cobe have determine that interstellar dust grain temperature can range from to interstellar grain be not at all close to blackbody the large grain have size of order micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency however at temperature below k of the thermal emission will be beyond micron where radiate efficiency be poor a small antenna can not easily radiate at long wavelength thu the grain must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorb moreover the ira observation have a maximum wavelength of micron grain colder than k will radiate primarily at longer wavelength and ira would be relatively insensitive to them in the extreme limit grain a cold a k will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation worse still ira color temperature be heavily contaminate by a population of small grain these grain have only perhap atom and when they be hit by a single photon they heat up to temperature of several hundred or k of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while but when they be radiate the characteristic temperature be several hundred k even a small population of these grain can dramatically raise the observe average temperature a model for local infrared emission consistent with cobe datum ha three component these represent scatter radiation from zodiacal dust color temperature k thermal emission from zodiacal dust tc k and thermal emission from galactic dust k at the ecliptic pole the emissivity or dilution factor be respectively and the first two be roughly double in the ecliptic plane to find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution factor time the fourth power of temperature for all component then take the fourth root in the table below starlight come from allen number that stellar emission from the whole sky be equivalent to zero mag star with b-v color of no doubt careful work could do much better the person who suggest starlight have a dilution factor of must have be remember wrong we would be cook if that be the case in any event the energy density of starlight come out about the same a that of the microwave background and i believe that to be correct dilution temp microwave background galactic dust zodiacal dust emission zodiacal dust scatter starlight the fourth root of be k outside the solar system the result would be k i find these result surprise especially the importance of zodiacal dust but i do see any seriou mistake steve willner phone bitnet willner cfa cambridge ma usa internet willner member league for programming freedom contact lpf
