from kjenk subject re astronaut what do weightlessnes feel like in article jlieb jerry liebelson write i want to know what weightlessnes actually feel like for example be there a constant sensation of fall ron baalke baalke reply ye weightlessnes do feel like fall it may feel strange at first but the body do adjust the feel be not too different from that of sky dive i no astronaut but i fly in the several time i tell you about my first flight at the on-set of weightlessnes my shoulder lift and my spine straighten i felt a momentary panic and my hand try to grab onto something like the strap keep me firmly against the floor to prevent me from fall i remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motion my ear felt not hear a rush and i could feel fluid move in my head like when you get up from bed while you have a cold at that point i cease to concentrate on my physiological response since i have some science to do i wa busy keep my experiment go and keep track of all the part during the return of gravity and subsequent pull-out so i do really pay attention to physiology at that time after about parabola i discover that i wa perform one of the trick i discover to keep myself from get motion sicknes i wa keep my head very still and move very slowly all except my hand and arm which need to be in rapid conciou motion for my experiment during the pull-out to parabola my queasines finally start to get to me and i have to use one of those air-sicknes bag i wa basically useles for the rest of that flight so i go to the seat in the back of the plane while my partner whom i draft for just thi purpose keep work on the experiment while i wa ill he wa a vetran vomit comet rider one of those anomalou person who do get sick on the thing i do think of it a a constant sensation of fall so much a like swim in air it very close to the sensation i feel when i scuba dive and i turn my head down and fin up jerry and what be the motion sicknes that some astronaut occasionally experience ron it be the body reaction to a strange environment it appear to be induce partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distres some person be more prone to it than other like some person be more prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than other the mental part be usually induce by a lack of clear indication of which way be up or down ie the shuttle be normally orient with it cargo bay point toward earth so the earth or grind be above the head of the astronaut about of the astronaut experience some form of motion sicknes and nasa ha do numerou test in space to try to see how to keep the number of occurance down i a volunteer in jsc space biomedical laboratory where they do among other thing some of the test ron mention i wa in one call the pre-flight adaptation trainer which consist of a chair on a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with move geometric visual aid the goal wa to measure the subject response and subjective physiological description and see if repeat exposure to thi environment could reduce future motion sicknes symptom jerry i do know of any former or active-duty astronaut who personally read thi group i know that bruce mccandles office have be wait anxiously for the space station redesign option i post last week but i do think bruce read the group himself ken jenk space shuttle program office kjenk the man who make no mistake do not usually make anything edward john phelp american
