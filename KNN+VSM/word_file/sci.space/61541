from howard greg howard subject re gamma ray burster how energetic could they be in article belgarath write in article jfc john f carr write how much energy do a burster put out i know energy depend on distance which be unknown an answer of the form x erg per be ok different sphere oort cloud radiu at the edge of the galaxy or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a for a radiu of pc we find an l around pretty energetic for close by for the coronal model we find around and lastly for the cosmological model an that what you call moderately energetic i say any suggestion about what could put out that much energy in one second jeremy supernova put out or i forget which but it only an order of magnitude not in gamma ray though you haftum get all of that into gamma if they be at mpc but if a decent fraction of the sn output wa in gamma it could reasonably be extragalactic but closer than mpc i dunno sn theory so well but i ca think of how to get many gamma out maybe i should look it up big radio galaxy can put out continually that just in the radio there be a lot of gamma around them too but burst nah neither of these should be take a explanation just try to show that those energy be produce by thing we know about greg
