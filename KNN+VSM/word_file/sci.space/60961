from dietz paul dietz subject commercial mine activity on the moon in article gary gary coffman write be the site of major commercial activity a far a we know it ha no material we ca get cheaper right here on earth or from asteroid and comet aside from the semi-mythic that might be useful in low grade fusion reactor i do know what a low grade fusion reactor be but the major problem with aside from the difficulty in make any fusion reactor work be that it concentration in lunar regolith be just so small on the order of ppb or so on average more in some fraction but still very small massive amount of regolith would have to be process thi thread remind me of wingo claim some time ago about the moon a a source of titanium for use on earth a i recall wingo wa content with be assure that titanium at in the earth crust average would not run out and tout lunar mine even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these day be around thi prompt me to look up large potential terrestrial source on the moon titanium occur in basalt high-tus basalt apollo and have titanium dioxide by weight thi be nice but terrestrial continental flood basalt be also typically enrich in titanium they very often have frequently have and sometime even again by weight these flood basalt be enormou million of cubic kilometer scatter all over the world siberium brazil the nw united state ethiopium etc if even of the basalt be thi be trillion of ton of at concentration only a factor of le than in lunar high-tus basalt it be difficult to see how the disadvantage of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore never mind the richer but le common terrestrial ore be mine today paul f dietz dietz
