subject re gamma ray burster where be they from belgarath in article att prb pat write what evidence indicate that gamma ray burster be very far away given the enormou power i wa just wonder what if they be quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic range my own pet theory be that it flying saucer enter hyperspace but the reason i be ask be that most everyone assume that they be collide nuetron star or spin black hole i just wonder if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in pat well let see i take a clas on thi last fall and i have no note so i try to wing it here how i understand it remember from stellar evolution that black hole and neutron star pulsar be form from high ma star m star sun high ma star live fast and burn hard take appoximately year before go nova or supernova in thi time they do live long enough to get perturb out of the galactic plane so any of these if assume to be the source of grb will be in the plane of the galaxy then we take the catalog of burst that have be recieved from the variou satellite around the solar system pioneer venu ha one either pion or ginga and of course batse and we do distribution test on my catalog these test all show that the burst have an isotropic distribution evenly spread out in a radial direction and they show sign of homogeneity they do not clump in any one direction so unles we be sample the area inside the disk of the galaxy we be sample the universe not cool if you want to figure out what the hell cause these thing now i suppose you be say well we stil only may be sample from inside the disk well not necessarily remember we have what be more or le an interplanetary network of burst detector with a baseline that go waaaay out to beyond pluto pioneer so we should be able with all of my detector de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite here an analogy you see a plane overhead you measure the angle of the plane from the origin of ymy arbitrary coordinate system one of ymy friend a mile away see the same plane and measure the angle from the zero point of hi arbitrary system which be the same a your the two angle be different and you should be able to triangulate the position of ymy burst and maybe find a source to my knowledge no one ha be able to do thi i should throw in why halo and corona model do work also a i say before look at the possible astrophysic of the burst short timescale high energy black hole and pulsar exhibit much of thi type of behavior if thi be the case a i say before these star seem to be bind to the disk of the galaxy especially the most energetic of the these source when you look at a simulate model where the burst be confine to the disk but you sample out to large distance say mpc you should definitely see not only an anisotropy toward you in all direction but a clump of source in the direction of the galactic center a i say before there be none of these characteristic i think that all of it if someone need clarification or know something that i do know by all mean correct me i have the honor of take the burst clas with the person who ha do the model of these different distribution so we pretty much kick around every possible distribution there wa and some very outrageou source colliding pulsar black hole pulsar that be slow down stuff like that it a fun field complaint and correction to belgarath or post here jeremy
