from prb pat subject why will be the way of the future i once read an article on computer technology which state that every new computer technology wa actually lower and slower then what it replace silicon wa le effective then the germanium product then available gaa wa le capable then silicon multi-processor be slower then existent single processor what the argument wa though wa that these new technology promise either theoretically future higher performance or lower cost or higher density i think that the may into thi same model elv can certainly launch more weight then a ssrt but an ssrt offer the prospect of greater cycle time and lower cost thi be kind of a speculative post but i think i throw it out a a hjistorical framework for those interest in the project pat
