from davis davi subject re japanese moon orbit in article pgf phil g fraering write rl ray swartz oh that guy again write the gravity maneuver that wa use wa to exploit region these be describe by the inventor a exploit the second-order perturbation in a three body system the probe wa launch into thi region for the earth-moon-sun system where the perturbation affect it in such a way a to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditure of fuel to slow down the idea be that object sometime get capture without expend fuel we just find the trajectory that make it possible the originator of the technique say that nasa wa interest but that japan wa because their probe wa small and could hold a lot of fuel for deceleration i should probably re-post thi with another title so that the guy on the other thread would see that thi be a practical use of temporary orbit another possible temporary orbit phil fraering seem like every day we find out all sort of stuff pgf how the ancient mayan have televison repo man if you be really interest in these orbit and how they be obtain you should try and find the follow paper hiroshi yamakawa kawaguchi nobuaki ishius and hiroki matsuo a numerical study of gravitational capture orbit in the earth-moon system spaceflight mechanic meeting colorado spring colorado the reference include in thi paper be quite interest also and include several that be specific to the hiten mission itself steven davi davis o o db mcdonnell dougla i do represent vv space system company anybody but myself houston division
