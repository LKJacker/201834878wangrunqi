from hrubin herman rubin subject government and science and technolgy investment in article kjenk write person who criticize big government and it project rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of government in science and technology basically the government ha get into the role of support research which private industry find too expensive or too long-term historically thi role for the wa force upon it because of socialism in other country in order for industry to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitor the ha take on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead r d thi definitely have nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science some of it be relevant in technology there wa little involvement of federal fund or except through support of state university of state fund for scientific research before wwius the u research position have be grow steadily and the fund wa mainly from university and private foundation fund there be not that many research university but they all provide their researcher with low teach load laboratory assistant and equipment and fund for travel to scientific meet not that much but it wa provide and a university wish to get a scholar have to consider research fund a well a salary during wwius the military and the defense department find that pure scientist could do quite well with their problem even though they be not exactly in the area of the scientist expertise thi be probably because of the research mind approach which be not to try to find a solution but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerge thi work in stage and a research scientist be use to discussion about their problem the job get do the military realize the importance of maintain scientist for the future and start fund pure research after wwius but congres wa unwilling to have military fund divert into thi investment into the future supply of scientist and set up other organization such a nsf to do the job it also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politic out also the government do a job on private foundation make it more difficult for them to act to support research the worst part of the federal involvement be that in those area in which the government support research the university will not provide fund and in fact expect it scholar to bring in net government money suppose a ha be the case i have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few month what do you think happen if i ask for one the answer i will get be get the money from nsf now the money at the university level be a few thousand but at the nsf level it come to about thousand and be likely to keep a faculty member from get support so the government be in effect decide which project get support and how much also the government decide that the wealth should be spread so instead of have a moderate number of university which be primarily research institution the idea that more school should get into the act come into be and instead of evaluate scholar they have to go to evaluate reseach proposal a a researcher i can tell you that any research proposal ha to be mainly wishful think or a now happen the investigator conceal already do work to release it a the result of the research what i be propose today i may solve before the fund be grant i may find impossible or i may find that it be too difficult in addition tomorrow i may get unexpected research result possibly i may bet a bright idea which solf yesterday too difficult problem or a whole new approach to something i have not consider can develop thi be the nature of the beast and except for really vague statement if something can be predict it be not major research but development or routine activity not require more than minimal attention of a good researcher i believe that at thi time le quality research be be do than would have happen if the government have never get into it and the government be try to divert researcher from thinker to plodder herman rubin dept of statistic purdue univ west lafayette phone hrubin internet bitnet purdue pur-ee hrubin uucp
