from henry henry spencer subject re hst servicing mission scheduled for day in article ckb prb pat write how will say re-boost be do grapple hst stow it in cargo bay do om burn to high altitude unstow hst repair gyro costar install fix solar array then return to earth actually the reboost will probably be do last so that there be a fuel reserve during the eva in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that but ye you get the idea the reboost be do by take the whole shuttle up my gues be why bother with usingthe shuttle to reboost why not grapple do all say fix bolt a small liquid fuel thruster module to hst then let it make the re-boost somebody ha to build that thruster module it not an off-the-shelf item nor be it a trivial piece of hardware since it ha to include attitude control hst own be not strong enough to compensate for thing like thruster imbalance guidance there be no provision to fee gyro datum from hst own gyro to an external device and separation you do want it leave attach afterward if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid be open again you also get to worry about whether the lid be go to open after the reboost be do and hst be inaccessible to the shuttle the lid stay close for the duration of all of thi to prevent mirror contamination from thruster and the like the original plan wa to use the orbital maneuvering vehicle to do the reboost the omv wa plan to be a sort of small space tug well suit to precisely thi sort of job unfortunately it wa cost a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known application wa relatively short so it get cancel resemble a high-speed collision henry spencer u of toronto zoology between and suno dick dunn henry utzoo henry
