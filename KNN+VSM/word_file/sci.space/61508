from tom subject also ask any electric-guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer and they tell you tube-type since tube have lower distortion and noise than transistor most of ymy electric guitar type just say tube sound better dude of course they then turn up the reverb the gain add in the analog delay line and the fuzz box i think they would notice the distortion oh i forget the phase shifter it be kind of absurd be it some player even want more distortion especially the hendrix fan but there be a lot of them out there that can only afford the amp or who like play music without distortion then there be ymy hard-core hendirx fan that want particular type of distortion they make it not their amp also transistor have the advantage in both waste-heat and energy-use mainly because of the heater on the cathode of the tube ah but how do they compare to mechanical system i do see a thing about waste-heat from babbage and have see one of those mechanical tv in a while so it anybodie gues tommy mac tom mcwilliam wk they communicate with the communist hm and pacify the pacifist
