from leech jon leech subject space faq controversial question archive-name last-modified date controversial question these issue periodically come up with much argument and few fact be offer the summary below attempt to represent the position on which much of the net community ha settle please do bring them up again unles there something truly new to be discuss the net ca set public policy that what ymy representative be for what happened to the saturn v plan despite a widespread belief to the contrary the saturn v blueprint have not be lose they be keep at marshall space flight center on microfilm the problem in re-create the saturn v be not find the draw it be find vendor who can supply vintage hardware like guidance system component and the fact that the launch pad and vab have be convert to space shuttle use so you have no place to launch from by the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify the launch pad you may a well have start from scratch with a clean sheet design why datum from space mission is immediately available investigator associate with nasa mission be allow exclusive acces for one year after the datum be obtain in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the datum and publish result without be scoop by person uninvolved in the mission however nasa frequently release example in non-digital form photo to the public early in a mission risk of nuclear rtg power source for space probe there ha be extensive discussion on thi topic spark by attempt to block the galileo and ulyss launch on grind of the plutonium thermal source be dangerou numerou study claim that even in worst-case scenario shuttle explosion during launch or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocity the risk be extremely small two interest datum point be the may los of two snap rtg which land intact in the pacific ocean after a nimbu b weather satellite fail to reach orbit the fuel wa recover after month with no release of plutonium in april the apollo lunar module reentered the atmosphere and it snap rtg heat source which wa jettison fell intact into the foot deep tonga trench in the pacific ocean the corrosion resistant material of the rtg be expect to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to half-life of the fuel or about year doe to make ymy own inform judgement some reference you may wish to pursue be a good review of the technical fact and issue be give by daniel salisbury in radiation risk and planetary exploration the rtg controversy planetary report may-june page another good article which also review the event precede galileo launch showdown at pad by robert g nichol appear in the november issue of ad astra both magazine be publish by pro-space organization the planetary society and the national space society respectively gordon l chipman jr advanced space nuclear system aa in developing the space frontier edit by albert naumann and grover alexander univelt p hazard from plutonium toxicity by bernard l cohen health physic vol may page nu corporation safety statu report for the ulyss mission risk analysi book document number be nu there be no gpo publish jan nasa office of space science and application final environmental impact statement for the ulyss mission tier no serial number or gpo number but probably available from nti or nasa june doe department of energy transuranic element in the environment wayne c hanson editor doe document no government printing office washington april impact of the space shuttle on the ozone layer from time to time claim be make that chemical release from the space shuttle solid rocket booster srb be responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer study indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in absolute term and relative to other chemical source the remainder of thi item be a response from the author of the quote study charle jackman the atmospheric model study of the space shuttle effect on the stratosphere involve three independent theoretical group and wa organize by dr michael prather institute for space study the three group involve michael prather and marium garcium charlie jackman and anne douglas space flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and environmental research inc the effort wa to look at the effect of the space shuttle and titan rocket on the stratosphere the follow be the estimate source of stratospheric chlorine industrial source natural source shuttle source the shuttle source assume space shuttle and titan rocket be launch yearly thu the launch would add le than to the total stratospheric chlorine source the effect on ozone be minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decrease by thi be much le than total ozone variability associate with volcanic activity and solar flare the influence of human-made chlorine product on ozone be compute by atmospheric model calculation to be a decrease in globally average ozone between and the influence of the space shuttle and titan rocket on the stratosphere be negligible the launch schedule of the space shuttle and titan rocket would need to be increase by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone a my increase in industrial halocarbon do at the present time theoretical result of thi study have be publish in the space shuttle impact on the stratosphere mj

minute or so be unlikely to produce permanent injury holding ymy breath be likely to damage ymy lung something scuba diver have to watch out for when ascend and you have eardrum trouble if ymy eustachian tube be badly plug up but theory predict and animal experiment confirm that otherwise exposure to vacuum cause no immediate injury you do not explode ymy blood do not boil you do not freeze you do not instantly lose consciousnes variou minor problem sunburn possibly the bend certainly some mild reversible painles swell of skin and underlie tissue start after ten second or so at some point you lose consciousnes from lack of oxygen injury accumulate after perhap one or two minute you die the limit be not really know reference the effect on the chimpanzee of rapid decompression to a near vacuum alfred g koestler ed nasa nov experimental animal decompression to a near vacuum environment bancroft dunn ed report june usaf school of aerospace medicine brook afb texa how the challenger astronaut died the challenger shuttle launch wa not destroy in an explosion thi be a well-documented fact see the roger commission report for example what look like an explosion wa fuel burn after the external tank come apart the force on the crew cabin be not sufficient to kill the astronaut never mind destroy their body accord to the kerwin team report the astronaut be kill when the more-or-les intact cabin hit the water at circa and their body then spend several week underwater their remain be recover and after the kerwin team examine them they be send off to be bury using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit you ca use the shuttle orbiter for mission beyond low earth orbit because it ca get there it be big and heavy and do not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tank furthermore it be not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight be thing like wing which be totally useles except in the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter be highly specialize for travel between earth surface and low orbit taking it higher be enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystem to build a specialize high-orbit spacecraft yet another concise answer by henry spencer the face on mar there really be a big rock on mar that look remarkably like a humanoid face it appear in two different frame of viking orbiter imagery much more facelike in appearance and the one more often publish with the sun degree above western horizon and with the sun degree from the west science writer richard hoagland ha champion the idea that the face be artificial intend to resemble a human and erect by an extraterrestrial civilization most other analyst concede that the resemblance be most likely accidental other viking image show a smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resemble kermit the frog elsewhere on mar there exist a mar anomaly research society sorry do know the addres to study the face the mar observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution camera and better image of the formation will hopefully settle thi question in a few year in the meantime speculation about the face be
