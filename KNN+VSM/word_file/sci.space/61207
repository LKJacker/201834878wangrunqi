from subject commercial space news commercial space technology investor number thi be number twenty-two in an irregular series on commercial space activity the commentary include be my think on these development sigh a usual i get behind in get thi column write i can only plead the exigency of the current dynamic in the space biz thi column be put together at lunch hmy and after the house quiet down at night so datum can quickly build up if there a lot of other stuff go on i comply a lot of information and happen since the last column so i go to have to work to keep thi one down to a readable length have fun content u commercial space sale flatten in deltum win two key launch contract commercial remote sensing venture get doc go-ahead investment firm call gd space biz still a good investment ariane predict dip in launch demand ntsb investigate pegasu launch over aborted abort another pegasu competitor is announced georgia launch site dropped from planning spain capricornium launcher still proceeding pacastro sign launch reservation with swedish space corp china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported south korea announce national move into space technology space technology index through march final note article u commercial space sale flatten in the u department of commerce project u commercial space sale will remain flat in with current datum show only a percent growth over a publish in u industrial outlook which wa release in january revenue from the u space busines be currently project to be about m in contrast to previou year when u commercial space sale have show double digit growth rate thi year project result be drive by the u satellite manufacture industry where sale be project to drop from satellite worth m in to satellite worth m in the u industrial outlook also project commercial launcher face flat demand in come year and while predict that revenue will increase percent to m future sale will be adversely affect by the downward revision in department of defense launch plan offsetting flat launch revenue and satellite delivery revenue for fix and mobile satellite service be project to increase to m primarily drive by increase revenue from broadcast and cable tv network similarly remote sense product and sale be project to increase to m in up u commercial space revenue r e commercial satellite satellite service fixed mobile satellite grind equip mobile equipment commercial launch remote sense datum and service private microgravity research lab total annual revenue r revise datum for e estimate datum for commentary thi be the first look at how the u commercial space industry be expect to do in in general not a bad report with most of the bad news concentrate in the satellite manufacture area there change of only a few satellite worth m or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection if we look forward over several year thi market sector should retain strong sale a u firm have be very successful in regain international market share in the satellite busines furthermore sale of satellite grind equipment should go up in the next revision of thi datum expect to be release about mid year datum on mobile satellite grind equipment sale include such item a gp receiver and portable satellite terminal appear to be miss from the january datum set doc usually publish a list of space busines indicator in mid-year and the next revision of commercial space revenue should be release then i expect the revise revenue should easily top m if the mobile satellite grind equipment be add back into the number and the year should show about a overall market growth looking beyond thi year datum future market look quite promise the doc project satellite service revenue could top m by if new mobile satellite service and direct broadcast be implement a plan and that mobile satellite station sale be expect to continue to growth at per year through the mid my number be somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth but i agree the trend should be for substantial growth in u commercial space sale over at least the next year my pessimism be due to more conservative assumption on market capture and growth in leo communication and satellite direct broadcast service i do believe all of the current player in the yet-to-be-born leo communication satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcast market will be financial success nor that sale growth will be a explosive a currently project it should also be note thi year doc datum be the first release to show revenue from privately fund microgravity research facility the m show in the janurary datum be primarily for the spacehab module plan for launch in april on the space shuttle but also hide in these number be the project first sale from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module deltum win two key launch contract mcdonnell dougla corporation which build and market the deltum launch vehicle ha win two important launch contract motorola inc announce in mid february that it have select the deltum to launch most of the satellite in the iridium leo communication constellation and in mid april mcdonnell dougla wa award the usaf medium launch vehicle iius contract the launch service contract with motorola for the iridium constellation launch be for at launch of least iridium satellite another satellite have be contract to be launch by khrunichev enterprise in russian on proton vehicle launch these satellite plan for the deltum will be launch at a time provide for at least launch additional satellite in the iridium constellation such a a plan on-orbit spare may also be launch on deltum although detail of the launch service contract be report to be negotiation and not yet final the usaf mlv contract also go to mdc bid a variant of their deltum ius launcher thi contract be only initially worth million but establish a set of launch option for up to launch encompass launch from through these launch will deploy the next generation of the usaf global positioning system block iir navigation satellite plu other program first option for to meet the usaf launch option be expect to be exercise thi year after which the usaf be expect to request launch of up to delta per year for at least year under thi contract the usaf can also request launch on demand service from mdc for the time period with a launch to occur within day of the request commentary if these two contract be fulfil they should provide an excellent busines base for mdc deltum launch program through the turn of the century combined these two contract have a potential for about launch worth about m to mdc and sustain a core busines base of other contract for international and commercial payload a well a for nasa medium elv-clas payload will add to thi busines base keep mdc a a viable commerical launch company however it should be note there be risk element in these contract motorola iridium leo communication constellation ha not yet receive a u federal communication commission license for operation in the nor ha motorola line up all the finance and financial partner for the iridium venture without these approval or financial back there will be no iridium launch but hopefully these uncertainty will be settle thi year similarly the usaf mlv iius program ha be the target of several congressional action which have slow the production of the gp block iir satellite and delete the fund for the mlv iius program in favor of the usaf nl spacelifter program at thi time while it appear the mlv iius contract will be execute future fund for the mlv iius and other usaf commercial launch contract be be reconsider a part of national space launch strategy review some opinion express from within the administration and congres propose cancellation of all elv upgrade program include the mlv program in favor of the propose spacelifter program such opinion may have some weight in thi year budget deliberation particularly a dod fund will be more difficult to find in the shrink u defense budget commercial remote sensing venture get doc go-ahead the first commercial license to operate a remote sense satellite wa approve in early february by the u department of commerce office of space commerce a license wa grant to worldview imaging corporation of oakland californium to build and operate a pair of leo image satellite to provide multi-spectral image of the earth commentary there ha be little datum release on thi venture by worldview and the doc other than the announcement of the operate and construction license thi wa report to be at the request of worldview most industry speculation identify thi new venture a a star war spinoff use sdi-type technology to provide digital earth sense datum and heavily integrate into digital gi databasis for remote user most probable customer for thi service include exploration geologist agricultural planner and urban planner it be noteworthy thi be the first commercial venture under the land remote sensing policy act the act a pass last november provide that remote sense datum gather from private remote sense craft may be sell to user at differ price prior to thi act remote sense datum from all satellite have to be sell to all user at the same price and private remote sense venture would have have to sell at the government-set landsat datum price there be rumor of several other potential commercial remote sense venture work their way through the system at different stage of development i think the large landsat and spot satellite system will provide the majority of the satellite remote sense datum market for the next decade or so in contrast to these large government-sponsored remote sense system smaller market venture such a worldview and other can exploit market nich and use innovative technology and i believe can find profitability on the margin i predict there may be some very interest venture appear in the next year or so investment firm call gd space biz still a good investment wall street investment house morgan stanley think general dynamic space system division could still be a moneymaker despite have fail in the last atla launch in a recent analyst report morgan stanley say we be more than ever convince that if the company can return the atla to it historical plu succes rate thi will become a highly profitable cash generate unit based upon discussion with gd corporate management morgan stanley project that if the atla problem be clear up the unit could see m in earn per year by and m per year by thi be base upon gd projection of capture about atla launch per year on the world market commentary three failure in a row of their launch system ha hurt general dynamic space system division since gd ha restructure to only keep a very few profitable core business many market pundit have be speculate gd space busines might be next to be sell the morgan stanley report indicate gd space system division ha some potential a a moneymaker despite current problem if they can get their act together sale be project to be about m in which will probably generate a los of about m if gd can capture their project share of the space launch market and if they have manage to clean up the reliability of their atla launcher then they could generate healthy profit from those sale but until they demonstrate the atla centaur program be back on track thi division will continue to show substantial loss in response to the sell-off rumor in my opinion thi operation be not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability to do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional management would be replace with another set from outside the firm in gd ssd case to get the division back on track the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problem with the atla centaur a well a in sell atla service thi would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operation could find such talent in-house and be able to convince customer to buy their launch service optimally the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in market space technology internationally a well candidate for thi might be trw rockwell lockheed and martin and possibly mcdonnell dougla and boeing but most of those firm have cash flow problem mdc have have a substantial busines contraction boeing and mdc be involve with other launch firm lockheed or have take on substantial debt martin and come up with the m purchase price for the division be a big chunk of change for any company ariane predict dip in launch demand arianespace the operator of the ariane launch system be project a dip in launch demand in the late in early february arianespace release their annual market survey which detail their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade over short run arianespace expect to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market of international and commercial launch plan through ariane hold contract for general dynamic atla vehicle hold contract mcdonnell dougla deltum hold and great wall long march vehicle hold launch contract three-quarter of future launch contract for which ariane can compete be project to come from communication satellite with the remain split between weather earth observation and scientific satellite most of the future telecommunication demand growth be predict to come from the region arianespace expect the current market consolidation of individual satellite operator into regional or national group will continue with these group invest in heavier satellite with larger communication payload carry more transponder arianespace predict the average ma of telecommunication satellite should increase by over today average level to about kg in geo demand for commercial launch service be expect to remain strong over the next three year but in the second half of the decade arianespace predict demand will decrease arianespace basis thi prediction upon a match of satellite transponder demand and supply particularly a new datum compression technique appear to could double or triple transponder capacity use exist or near-term transponder one of the significant possible change in the market wa identify a the arrival of new launch vehicle include russian launch system but arianespace predict that in the long term investor purchase launch service be look for the best trade off between launch service quality and price and that russian and other new launch service will have to prove out their capability and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal commentary ariane release their market survey annually and i report on their prior market survey in a past issue of comparing the two survey there be outstanding difference in the number the most notable change be the consideration of new datum compression technique reduce the demand for new physical transponder on orbit i note that in contrast to some prediction demand for space base communication transponder appear to be remain strong while fiber optic line be make substantial inroad into the establish point-to-point telecommunication market grow demand for telecommunication service world wide and for point-to multipoint broadcast service have prevent a decrease in space transponder demand fiberoptic cable provide a higher capability service but only from establish point a to establish point b to establish a fiberoptic link it be necessary to install cable between the point and while there be improve network solution instal a large network of distribute fiberoptic link can cost million or billion of dollar for broadcast service where there be not an exist grind network structure satellite still offer the most cost effective solution and if new service be require into a new region it be cheaper to install a small satellite link cost only a few ten of thousand of dollar and tie into the exist global satellite network thi allow rapid growth of new satellite service and ha keep demand high the replacement market for fiberoptic be grow a well since a demand grow between the point service it become cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic since the telecommunication and datum transfer market be still grow rapidly satellite market projection remain rosy but satellite be also get longer orbital lifetime current generation satellite be now get guarantee of at year of on-orbit service or more in contrast to year of service from last generation satellite thi ha cut back some of the launch demand a satellite owner be reschedule replacement satellite launch over longer interval and a last note arianespace do flag it thi year but it look like the space transportation market will be rather over supply by exist launch system in the near term the annual commercial launch demand be for about medium size satellite per year from the supply side ariane be capable of launch up to about a dozen medium size satellite a year deltum be capable of about per year atla be capable of long march japan h-vehicle russium proton capable of and other system such a zenit and soyuz another medium launch per year that a lot of capability for a small market we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launch ntsb investigate pegasu launch over aborted abort the feb pegasu launch by orbital science corporation ha spawn an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rule a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt the mission wa override and the pegasu wa launch in violation of range safety rule in the last few minute of the pegasu launch countdown one of two abort command receiver aboard the pegasu fail such a failure typically scrub a launch and a nasa range safety officer at wallop island va issue a mission abort order about a minute before the schedule pegasu launch somehow thi command wa override by the osc launch team or the message wa lose in the communication channel and the pegasu wa launch despite the valid abort call fortunately the pegasu function a expect and the abort command receiver wa not need but thi incident do spark an investigation since a valid abort order wa give under agreed-to launch constraint rule and wa not obey leading the investigation be the national transportation safety board ntsb with support from nasa osc and the air force thi investigation mark the first time ntsb ha take the lead on an incident involve a space launch according to the ntsb their investigation will take about month and be primarily look at line of authority communication link and safety procedure use in the launch commentary thi be the first time that the ntsb ha lead an investigation into a space launch their leadership wa request by the department of commerce office of commercial space transportation who have license the commercial launch at the time of write thi column some of the initial investigation have be conclude and some of the result be start to leak out into the trade pres apparently or fmy different communication channel be in use during the test after the abort destruct receiver stop respond the nasa test director and range controller in the mission control room at wallop island give abort order about a minute before the launch according to the mission rule thi should have stop the launch somehow the osc test conductor order the abort reverse and the nasa communicator on the net relay that order to the carry the pegasu at about second before launch differing explaination of exactly how thi happen be propose with the best set be that clear line of communication and clear definition of the responsibility of the mission control team and understand of the mission rule be not establish before the launch a we see more and more commercial launch more of these procedural issue be go to crop up and will have to be resolve thi case be interest because it be the first time the ntsb ha be call in to investigate a commercial launch problem a they do with commercial aircraft problem i think thi problem will turn out to be primarily problem with procedure and communication and will be clear up with issuance of guideline on how launch communication should be set up and how specific line of authority should be delineate another pegasu competitor is announced tsniimach enterprise in russium announce it be market a new small space launch system base upon convert icbm component two version of the launcher be be market the aerokosmo wing vehicle launch like the osc pegasu and the severkosmo launch from a mobile grind transporter the aerokosmo be project to deliver kg to a km circular orbit or kg to an km circular orbit and the severkosmo to be capable of kg to km orbit and kg to km also propose to be use with these launch system be a leo datum relay system call tsniimach enterprise be describe a a ex-military establishment focus on aerodynamic and thermal protection of spacecraft and which ha participate in the development of the buran shuttle system they be locate near the npo energium facility in kaliningrad outside of moscow commentary there very little release information on thi new venture my suspicion be it be another russian enterprise look for hard currency and try to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-soviet launch system it add to the list of numerou commercial space startup announce from the ex-soviet union thi one a little different in that they be offer variant of ex-soviet icbm but i ca identify any key customer be target or substantial financial back georgia launch site dropped from planning in late january georgia tech research institute release the result of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launch site in camden county georgia at the old kingsland missile test launching site on the atlantic coast the preliminary study recommend the site not be pursue a a commercial launch site state reopen the site wa not feasible due to project low investment return plu environmental and other geographic consideration however the report do say the site might be ideal for other aerospace use and recommend other potential use commentary thi should put the nail in the coffin of the kingsland commercial launch site while other site be still proceed with commercial launch site development plan kingsland find without a key customer to act a anchor tenant and if substantial infrastructure have to be put in then the expect return be too low to justify the cost of development thi might point out some key discriminator in judge the feasibility of a commercial launch site these include is there an identify key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup cost is there a market advantage of use the site can exist infrastructure be use or modify at the site can finance be find at low enough cost to support the investment other commercial launch site venture include those at woomera poker flat cape york white sand alabama off-shore platform hawaius and vandenberg have to also be judge against these criterium in my opinion some of these venture be fly on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grind spain capricornium launcher still proceeding in one of hi last official act former president bush authorize space technology transfer for several joint space venture between u and other firm one of these wa a propose use of u technology by spain to build a small booster with that regulatory impediment remove the capricornium launch vehicle will start development later thi year plan for a first launch in the time period the capricornium be describe a a small all solid booster design to put kg into leo several launch site be be examine for the system include on the iberian peninsula and on the canary island originated by intum in spain the project report it ha m in development fund and will use technology from argentina condor launch vehicle a well a from the u commentary several firm have identify a market opportunity in provide a small launcher for the european market small payload from european firm or organization currently use either ariane piggyback launch or the scout launcher however ariane piggyback opportunity be limit and the scout program be be phase out accompany by some disarray in the italian government and space industry regard any follow-on system thi ha leave an apparent niche for a new european small launch system surprisingly enough esa ha not support development of such a system within the current space fund structure study have be perform by british aerospace aerospatiale deutsche aerospace and italian organization but with the exception of the system report below i have not be able to find any other european development work with even a rumor of fund for hardware also of interest be the link of the capricornium to the argentinian condor launcher there have be some interest rumor surface out of argentina over the past year about a space program fund under the military juntum which rule the country in the and early what be know be in feb the argentinian air force formally transfer control of the condor missile program to the new civilian argentinian national space agency comison nacional de atividade espaciale cna the condor program wa describe a originate in expand upon the smaller condor rocket program in collaboration with egypt and with support of german firm the condor wa also reportedly fund indirectly by iraq in the fairly large solid rocket motor be build and test but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lag that of the propulsion system it should be note cna be plan to launch it first scientific satellite in late the u m kg sac-b satellite will study the earth upper atmosphere and include cooperative experiment from italy and the u no launch vehicle ha yet be select but osc pegasu and the russian burlak air launch rocket be report to be strong contender for thi contract pacastro sign launch reservation with swedish space corp pacastro a small launch firm in herndon virginium announce in late february it have receive a m launch reservation contract from the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastro launch vehicle thi will be perform a part of the polar satellite service ps a joint norwegian space center swedish space corp program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and offer small satellite launch into the polar region according to pacastro ps be also perform an m upgrade of the andoya launch facility include a new integration facility and a fully enclose vertical assembly build for small launch vehicle like the pacastro pacastro ha be choose a the main alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service to be offer by ps from andoya the date of the launch of the swedish satellite wa not specify commentary pacastro ha be try to line up customer and fund for their launch vehicle for some time now the be a small two stage rocket fuel by and liquid oxygen from pacastro literature the engine design for the pa-series rocket be build of off the shelf component base upon the lunar module descent engine build by trw and be capable of put a kg satellite into a km circular polar orbit pacastro be try to arrange construction finance for it first three vehicle with a first launch plan for and orbital launch plan for my record show pacastro hire trw to provide market support and system design with primary engineer to be do by aeroastro a small satellite builder closely associate with pacastro headquarter in the same build the swedish space corporation would supply engineer launch operation vehicle subsystem and market support sumitomo corp of tokyo be a first round investor and sit on the board of director pacastro ha get a first round financial package of at least k some source place thi of high a m but ha be search for about a year for the additional m need to design build and launch their first set of vehicle the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be use to help bring some investor on board but by my estimate they will need much more than the single m sale to put their venture into real hardware china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported in early march it wa report a joint satellite communication venture between a taiwanese and mainland chinese wa in the work a report in the taipei pres china development corp cdc headquarter in taiwam and with link to the rule nationalist party be plan to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china great wall industry corp with the objective of launch a regional communication satellite cdc would cover about of the satellite system cost u m in exchange for right to of the satellite communication channel commentary thi announcement come close on the heel of the release of taiwanese plan for space development release in mid january in those plan the national space program office of taiwan will launch satellite start with a kg scientific spacecraft plan for launch in two additional satellite be plan both communication satellite trw ha be help taiwan plan thi program budget at t b u m through i have be able to establish any relationship between thi venture and those of the nspot but there might be a connection while taiwan ha the finance to pursue several venture the current taiwanese telecommunication market might not support two separate sastellite venture the report name for the system be asiasat but i do think thi ha any relationship with the exist hong kong-based asiasat program involve chinese hong kong and other asian investor other than use it a an organizational model there be some obviou advantage to pursue such a joing venture it could provide excellent first-hand experience to taiwan for a very low cost which then can be use in later satellite venture but there be internal political issue between taiwanese and chinese venture but put any joint venture through a hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed in any case the east asian satellite market be light up with substantially growth project in space service and revenue thi be just another indicator to add to the list south korea announce national move into space technology south korea trade industry and resource ministry recently announce plan to invest u b in research and development and another u b into manufacture and research facility for advance aerospace technology space technology have be specifically target a part of thi program begin with manufacture and launch of an advance multi-purpose satellite by the objective of thi investment be to raise south korea aerospace technology to the level of the world top country by commentary south korea ha be quietly work to develop it national aerospace industry specifically include space activity i note thi a a flag that potential new player be come into the commercial space market a part of their national effort national telecommunication satellite for korea telecom will be launch in april and oct on deltum designated koreasat and the platform will provide television and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula southwestern japan and portion of china border north korea south korea launch it first small satellite piggyback on ariane in aug call my star and cost about u m be plan for piggyback launch in october of thi year again on ariane and will be entirely make in korea project for a launch will be an environment monitor micro-satellite thi satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth observation satellite the keo korean earth observation system project which ha be submit for approval to the south korean government would use two or three spacecraft equip with optical and microwave sensor south korean pres report claim there be also a parallel military effort to establish the capability for build and launch small military satellite by supposedly a government panel have be establish to oversee such an effort fund at u m between and in anticipation of an expect pullout of intelligence-gathering system from the korean peninsula in conjunction with all of these report effort south korean be also pursue production work either a off-set to exist aerospace technology contract for example mcdonnell dougla be offset production of some deltum part to south korean firm a part of the koreasat launch contract or for production of consumer space item among other product south korea export satellite receiver television setup to japan and samsung ha announce team for production of osc orbcomm user terminal thi look like a very aggressive push into space technology considering that east asium be currently the fastest grow sector for commercial space service primarily for telecommunication a south korean push into space technology may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade space technology index through march a announce in the last each issue will give the result of stock index and portfolio regard space stock and investment the table below summarize result to the end of march the space technology index do quite a bite better than the market a a whole a represent by the s p index since of the value include in the index be u firm thi represent a general increase in the market value of space-related firm the increase in the first quarter be more than in all of which be a very promise sign although future month may reverse thi trend the commercial space technology index ha also do quite well but the pure play portfolio consist of stock of firm which be pure play in space technology ha also surpass it result in all of we keep an eye on these index result through march beginning beginning jan to mar s p space tech index space tech index space tech pure play final note what thi column already full and i still have bunch of commercial space development to report on a i say at the start of thi column there be a lot of interest happen but i have to put them into the next issue looking ahead i get several article in the work on new happen with iridium and the leo communication satellite market more news on international launcher appear and disappear on the market new international commercial space venture and other interest development and a alway i hope you folk find thi stuff useful and interest any and all comment be welcome wale larrison space technology investor felicita multo habet amico box seal beach ca
