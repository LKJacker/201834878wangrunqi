include in thi post send email to leech jon leech if you do want to see the faq add asked question to ymy kill file for thi group if you not read thi with a newsreader that can kill article by subject you out of luck the faq volume be excessive right now and will hopefully be trim down by rewrite and condense over time the faq post be available in the ame space archive in good summary will be accept in place of the answer give here the point of thi be to circulate exist information and avoid rehash old answer better to build on top than start again nothing more depress than rehash old topic for the time reference be provide because they give more complete information than any short generalization question fall into three basic type where do i find some information about space try ymy local public library first the net be not a good place to ask for general information ask individual by email if you must there be other source use them too the net be a place for open end discussion i have an idea which would improve space flight hope you be surprise but out of have usually be think of before again contact a direct individual source for evaluation nasa field thousand of these each day miscellanou query these be address on a case-by-case basi in the follow series of faq post suggestion for better netiquette read if you on usenet minimize cro reference do you really need to edit subject line especially if you take a tangent send mail instead avoid post follow up mail message worth post internet mail reader send request to to space-request not space read all available article before post a follow-up check all reference cut down attribute article leave only the point you respond to remove signature and header summarize put a return addres in the body signature of ymy message mail or article state ymy institution etc do assume the function of mailer will work use absolute date post in a timely way do post what everyone will get on tv anyway some editor and window system do character count line wrap keep line under character for those use ascius terminal use carriage return index to linked posting i attempt to break the post up into relate area there be a keyword index yet the follow list the major subject area in each post only those contain astronomy-related material be post to indicate by follow the post number content introduction
