from ethanb ethan bradford subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article steinly steinn sigurdsson write the problem with oort cloud source be that absolutely no plausible mechanism ha be propose it would have to involve new physic a far a i can tell closest to conventional oort source be a model of b-field pinch by comet it get too many hole in it to count but at least it wa a good try so you have a plausible model for grb at astronomical distance recent observation have just about rule out the merge neutron star hypothesi which have a lot of problem anyhow we have to look for implausible model and what be fundamentally allow independent of model a paper on the possibility of grb in the oort cloud just come through the astrophysic abstract service to get a copy of thi paper send a message to astro-ph with the subject line get here be the abstract of that paper the currently favor explanation for the origin of grb put them at cosmological distance but a long a there be no distance indicator to these event all possible source which be isotropically distribute should remain under consideration thi be why the oort cloud of comet be keep on the list although there be no know mechanism for generate grb from cometary nucleus unlikely a it may seem the possibility that grb originate in the solar cometary cloud can not be exclude until it be disprove we use the available datum on the distribution of grb the batse catalogue up to march and the catalogue of cometary orbit by marsden and william to investigate whether there be any observational indication for correlation between the angular distribution of grb and comet aphelium assume that the distribution of aphelium direction reflect at least to some extent true variation in the column density of the oort cloud we also apply the vov test to both distribution we have perform a variety of statistical test a kolmogorov-smirnov test for the distribution in galactic latitude a test for the spherical multiple moment and a cross-correlation analysi include test sub-sample for isolate the effect of possible observational bias these test imply that it be unlikely that the two distribution agree but the statistical significance be not sufficient for rule out any connection with complete confidence we perform monte-carlo simulation which show that only when the number of burst exceed sim it be possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distribution currently it be only the combination of these test with the large disagreement find for the vov parameter which make the oort cloud of comet unlikely to be relate to grb
