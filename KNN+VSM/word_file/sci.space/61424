from zwork michael corvin subject re hst servicing mission scheduled for day regarding the feasability of retrieve the hst for repair and relaunching it caution speculation mode engage there be another consideration that ha be mention yet i expect that retrieve hst would involve it considerably in order to return it to it cradle in the cargo bay most of the deploy item antenna and especially the solar aray probably be not retractable into their fully stow position even by hand they would have to be remove by the astronaut the only advantage that thi might yield be that we could put new panel on that do due to thermal cycle stress i also expect that a ha be discuss the land load on the hst optic structure be a big issue but that the reentry load be much le so can the moveable optical component even be re-caged i assume that they be cage for launch michael corvin zwork gn c r d martin mariettum astronautic my view not martin mariettum
