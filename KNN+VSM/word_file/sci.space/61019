from keithley craig keithley subject re why not give billion to first year-lo in article aw allen w sherzer write in article henry henry spencer write thi prize be big enough to warrent develop a ssto but it be enough to do it if the vehicle exist actually there be person who will tell you that it would be enough to do ssto development if do privately a a cut-rate operation of course they may be over-optimistic in spite of my great respect for the person you speak of i think their cost estimate be a bite over-optimistic if nothing else a work ssto be at least a complex a a large airliner and ha a smaller experience base it therefore seem that ssto development should cost at least a much a a typical airliner development that put it in the to range for the purpose of a contest i bet some thing could be cut like fuel for re-entry any kind of heat shield etc etc even still if the contest participant have to fund development it probably would be worth it to develop just for the contest just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rat or at least under or so gs booster if i do have to pay for development great i use it but back to the contest goal there wa a recent article in aw st about a low cost it all relative man return to the moon a general dynamic scheme involve a titan iv shuttle to lift a centaur upper stage lev and crew capsule the mission consist of deliver two unman payload to the lunar surface follow by a man mission total cost u wa billion joint esa nasa project wa billion for the u share i do find a mention of how long the crew could stay but i bet that it around day and the total payload deliver wa about metric tonne so if you ignore the scientific payload hitch a ride in the crew habitation module no return trip and tos in a few more tonne for the additional consumable to last another month then you might be able to get a year visit out of tonne and in case it not obviou that a wild a gues a pretty bore visit since every trip outdoor eat up a bite of lox and i not certain if a home brew or college-brewed life support system could last a year but let round thi up to tonne convient since the gd plan talk about ton payload deliver to the lunar surface thi add up to two centaur two lev two shuttle flight all to put a single man on the moon for a year hmmm not really practical anyone get a way of deliver tonne to the lunar surface within the decade anyone have a more precise gues about how much a year supply of consumable and equipment would weigh and i wa wonder about the gd lev is it reusable or be it discard to burn up on return to leo if it not discard could it be refuel henry do you know anything about the gd lev i note that it use engine are they would a lev fit in a i forget if i ever know what the cargo bay dimension be for the all in all i not certain that the single of stay on the moon for a year be wise useful how about a prize for the first non-government sponsered unman moon land then another for a man moon land then yet another for a system to extract consumable from lunar soil another for a reusable shuttle and so forth find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestent give up after one person appear to win and for those that do give up i find something a little scary about a half dozen person huddle in rickety little moon shelter i like to see a much a reward for co-operation a for competition lastly about ten or fifteen year back i seem to recall that there wa an english space magazine that have an on-going discussion about moonbasis on the cheap i recall it discuss thing like how much heat the human body produce how much lunar material it need for protection from solar flare etc unfortunately i do remember the name of thi magazine do thi ring a bell to anyone craig keithley i do remember i do recall apple computer inc i get no memory of anything at all keithley peter gabriel third album
