from mock patrick c mock subject re gamma ray burster where be they in article kwp kevin w plaxco write in article abdkw david ward write but i believe that there be a fundamental difference here the other x three instrument be focus instrument that more or le form an image so positional error be limit by craft attitude and the resolve power of the optic batse be an altogether different beast effectively just coincidence counter one on each corner of the craft positional information be triangulate from the differential signal arrival time at each of the detector thi be not quite right the differential arrival time techinique require interplanetary baseline to get good position the differential arrival at the eight detector differ by of nanosecond thi be smaller than batse microsecond time capability batse ulyss and mar obsverver be use for thi technique each batse detector do not have a full sky field of view the sensitivity of each detector decrease with increase angle of incidence the burst position on the sky be determine by compare the count rate in different detector pat
