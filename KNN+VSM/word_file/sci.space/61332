from mcelwre subject the universe of motion book review book review the universe of motion by dewey b larson north pacific publisher portland oregon page index hardcover the universe of motion contain final solution to most all astrophysical mystery thi book be volume iius of a revise and enlarge edition of the structure of the physical universe volume i be nothing but motion and volume ius be the basic property of matter most book and journal article on the subject of astrophysic be bristle with integral partial differential and other fancy mathematics in thi book by contrast mathematics be conspicuou by it absence except for some relatively simple formula imbed in the text larson emphasize concept and declare that mathematical agreement with a theory do not guarantee it conceptual validity dewey b larson wa a retire engineer with a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he develop the theory describe in hi book while try to find a way to mathematically calculate the property of chemical compound base only on the element they contain the universe of motion describe the astrophysical portion of larson consistent integrated comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe a kind of grand unify field theory that orthodox physicist and astro-physicist claim to be look for it be build on two postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time the physical universe be compose entirely of one component motion exist in three dimension in discrete unit and with two reciprocal aspect space and time the physical universe conform to the relation of ordinary commutative mathematics it primary magnitude be absolute and it geometry be euclidean from these two postulate larson wa able to build a complete theoretical universe from photon and subatomic particle to the giant elliptical galaxy by combine the concept of inward and outward scalar motion with translational vibrational rotational and rotational vibrational motion at each step in the development he wa able to match part of hi theoretical universe with correspond part in the real physical universe include even thing not yet discovered for example in hi book he first predict the existence of exploding galaxy several year before astronomer start find them they be a necessary consequence of hi comprehensive theory and when quasar be discover he have a relate explanation ready for those also a a result of hi theory which he call the reciprocal system larson totally rejected many of the sacred doctrine of orthodox physicist and astrophysicist include black hole neutron star degenerate matter quantum wave mechanic a apply to atomic structure nuclear physic general relativity relativistic ma increase relativistic doppler shift nuclear fusion in star and the big bang all of which he consider to be nothing more than mathematical fantasy he wa very critical of the ad hoc assumption uncertainty principle solution in principle no other way declaration etc use to maintain them the universe of motion be divide into chapter it begin with a description of how galaxy be build from the gravitational attraction between globular star cluster which be form from intergalactic ga and dust cloud that accumulate from the decay product of cosmic ray come in from the anti-matter half of the physical universe galaxy formation from the mythical big bang be a big mystery to orthodox astronomer he then go on to describe life cycle of star and how binary and multiple star system and solar system result from type i supernova explosion of single star several chapter be devote to quasar which accord to larson be densely-packed cluster of star that have be eject from the central bulge of explode galaxy and be actually travel faster than the speed of light although most of that speed be away from u in time astronomer and astrophysicist who run up against observation that contradict their theory would find larson explanation quite valuable if consider with an open mind for example they use to believe that gamma ray burst originate from pulsar which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of my galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observe that the burst come from all direction uniformly and do not correspond with any visible object except for a few case of directional coincidence larson explanation be that the gamma ray burst originate from supernova explosion in the anti-matter half of the physical universe which larson call the cosmic sector because the anti-matter universe exist in a reciprocal relation to my material universe with the speed of light a the boundary between them and ha three dimension of time and only one dimension of space the burst can pop into my material universe anywhere seemingly at random larson heavily quote or paraphrase statement from book journal article and lead physicist and astronomer in thi book of them be superscripted with number identify entry in the reference list at the end of the book for example a quote from the book astronomy the cosmic journey by william k hartmann say my hope of understand all star would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple star form unfortunately we can not larson book contain logical consistent explanation of such mystery that be worthy of seriou consideration by all physicist astronomer and astrophysicist for more information answer to ymy question etc please consult my cited source larson book un-altered reproduction and dissemination of thi important book review be encouraged robert e mcelwaine physic and astronomy uw-ec
