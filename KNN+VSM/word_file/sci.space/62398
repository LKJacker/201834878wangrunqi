from shoran stephen horan subject white sand dc-x it be interest to note in the past few day correspondance that some believe that poor old new mexico be not capable of host a commercial space launch busines for many reason it can and we here on the front line see no reason why it should not the political publicity refer to the other day have it intend effect the state of new mexico do establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port the command general at wsmr be in full support of dual-use for the facility the wsmr location also ha some strategic advantage in the form of necessary infrastructure and control air space to support the project just because the folk involve have not do the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by invite folk out to kick non-existent tire but have be merely do their job to prepare for launch do think that nothing ha happen from my interaction with the macdac folk i get the impression that they want to set a firm believable launch date base on vehicle readines and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar i believe that all will happen thi summer and do worry the local here be plan to let everyone know when it do occur stephen horan shoran
