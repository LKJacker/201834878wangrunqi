from gary gary coffman subject re philosophy quest how boldly in article palmer david m palmer write gary gary coffman write lack of a skeleton mean that muscle have to actively resist gravity at all time on land rather than supply only balance force that mean that much more energy would be require for the creature to function the bone also supply leverage point for push and lateral movement that why you do find large active boneles creature on land hydraulic can make rigid tube no energy require just for support hydraulic also allow a creature to produce large force with weak muscle use the principle of a hydraulic jack rather than a lever thi be one of those ye but thing it true that a hydraulically pressurize tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube but even at psi level a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily though it straight-on compressive strength be high and it torsional resistance increase be practically nil on the other grasp member there no doubt that hydraulic leverage exist in nature tree root be an example given time they can shatter concrete a osmotic pressure increase it interest to note that on land creature be either two legged or legged with tiny insect have or leg but never legged though that would be a stable configuration it can be argue that legged creature kangaroo be the specific number of limb a creature ha be an accident of evolution it be hard to make change in some structure the panda ha a thumb plu a many finger a it ancestor five on each hand but the thumb be a modify wristbone rather than a modify finger and extra finger be much more common than extra limb especially fully-functional one kangaroo i do think so if you take the view that the tail be a limb then monkey and kangaroo be i think the tail be a different kind of structure grossly enlarge in the case of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion i do know much about panda thumb so i ask be it opposable thermodynamic consideration of relationship would seem to dictate that active complex creature stay in a size range similar to what we see about u inch tall intelligent alien seem unlikely a do those much larger than the elephant why ca a lemur or a brontosauru be intelligent ye i know that the brontosauru be a mythical beast produce by put the head of another dinosaur on an apatosauru but so far space alien be also mythical well i wo say flat out that they ca be intelligent but i bring a couple of line of argument to bear to try to show why i do think it likely first let me say that when i say intelligent i mean complex behavior in response to novel situation on a level with or greater than human tool use and tool build ie assume suitable manipulator be present on the creature to allow it to alter it enviroment in a plan way it will do so that certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice for a putative technological alien now no one know exactly what make a brain capable of think but it generally accept that one of the criterium be a certain level of complexity thi be generally determine by the number of neuron cell and their interconnection so a creature the size of a lemur would have enough neuron to support complex think thi argument be considerably le clear in the case of the dinosaur there room for a large brain though no indication that one ever develop one reason thi may be true be neuronic speed the electrochemical message that trigger neuron require time to propagate thi make it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movement of very large creature so there little selection pressure for such brain instead a simpler distribute network evolf thi do rule out intelligent dinosaur but it point in that direction then there be the thermodynamic argument a tiny creature like the lemur need to eat frequently because it internal heat be rapidly lose due to it high surface to volume ratio i contend that a creature that must spend most of it time and energy feed wo have the time to develop and exercise intelligence that argument may be somewhat weak the dinosaur problem be the reverse it must moderate it heat production because it high volume to surface ratio make it tend to retain waste heat i assume that a certain temperature range be optimal for chemical reactivity reason for productive neuron function so creature would tend to need to maintain a regulate temperature in a range near that of human if they be carbon base that tend to rule out cold blood creature a potential home of intelligence some person contend that some of the dinosaur may have be warm blood but for a creature the size of a brontosaur it activity level would have to be restrain or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat whale be similar size but they can reject heat to the ocean a much more efficient sink than air i suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself a certain degree of activity in interact with the environment be necessary ie monkey curiousity i doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity gary
