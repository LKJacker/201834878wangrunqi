from globu al globu subject space colony size preference summary some time ago i send the follow message every once in a while i design an orbital space colony i gear up to do another one i some info from you if you be to move onto a space colony to live permanently how big would the colony have to be for you to view a permanent move a desirable specifically how many person do you want to share the colony with what physical dimension do the live be need to have assume live the colony will rotate assume that you can leave from time to time for vacation and busines trip if you young enough assume that you raise ymy child there i do get a lot of response and they be all over the block thanx muchly to all those who respond it be good food for think here the edit response i get how many person do you want to share the colony with what physical dimension do the live be need to have cylinder diameter x km long rui sousa ruca how many person do you want to share the colony with what physical dimension do the live be need to have square km surface divide into city town village and countryside must have lake river amd mountain how many person really be that large a number everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year and will probably be sick of everyone else within another year what physical dimension do the live be need to have hm i be not all that great at figure it out but i would maximize the percentage of colony-space that be accessible to human esecially if there be to be child since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyway and everyone especially me like to go explore i would want to be able to go for a walk and see something different each time for population i think i would want a substantial town big enough to have stranger in it thi help get away from the small-town everybody know everything syndrome which some person like but i do call it several thousand person for physical dimension a somewhat similar criterion big enough to contain surprise at least until you spend considerable time get to know it a a more specific rule of thumb big enough for there to be place at least an hmy away on foot call that which mean a circumference if we talk a sphere henry spencer at u of toronto zoology henry utzoo henry my desire for permanent move to a space colony assume easy communication and travel size about a small-town size say sq km bigger be better population about km or le so for les be better for elbow room more for interest and sanity so say max min tommy mac tom mcwilliam work inhale to the chief hm zonker harri in
