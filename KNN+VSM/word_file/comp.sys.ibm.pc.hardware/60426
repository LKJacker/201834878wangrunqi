from richk richard krehbiel subject re ide v scsi in article the great randalli write can anyone explain in fairly simple term why if i get i might need an scsi controler rather than an ide will performance suffer that much for a or so drive if i do have a tape drive or cd-rom any help would be appreciate richard randall there be a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gife you more cpu power then you have before and that be with overlap with overlap ymy cpu can continue to think while disk operation be underway wherea without overlap ymy cpu sit idly wait for each disk operation to finish and disk operation take an eternity compare to a fast cpu so when you get multi-tasking you want to increase performance by increase the amount of overlap you do one way be with dma or bu master either of these make it possible for device to move their datum into and out of memory without interrupt the cpu the alternative be for the cpu to move the datum there be several scsi interface card that allow dma and bu master ide however be define by the standard at interface create for the ibm pc at which require the cpu to move all the datum byte with no dma richard krehbiel richk will do for me until amigado for the come along
