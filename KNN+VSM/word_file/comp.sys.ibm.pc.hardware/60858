from willmore david willmore subject re ide v scsi wlsmith wayne smith write wayne write ide also use dma technique i believe floppy controller also use dma and most board also use dma dma be no big deal and ha nothing to do directly with scsi no the simple style ide controller do not use dma the cpu perform the datum transfer with a string move instruction thi require that the cpu stop what it have be do and transfer the datum only the smart drive controller be they ide or scsi can transfer vium dma these controller tend to cost the same wether they be ide or scsi to get the dma benefit ide must sacrifice it price advantage on the controller for example when rewinding or format a tape the command be issue to the controller and the bu be release to allow acces to other device on the bu thi greatly increase productivity or at least do something else while back up ymy hard drive which happen to be what i be do while read thi group you can thank ymy software for that if do have a few more brain it could format floppy etc while you be do something else the hardware will support it but do at least wo again thi ha nothing to do with scsi floppy be on the ide bu ymy arguement make no sense thi be an ide issue the floppy have their own processor on their controller board which handle all of these command the difference between ide and scsi be that all scsi peripherial be intelligent they each have their own controller they depend on the cpu to do fewer thing for them ide drife need a processor to transfer their datum it a long story but i still use ide on my except for the cdrom which thank to scsi i can move between both machine if and when scsi be better standardize and support on the ibm-clone machine i plan to completely get rid of ide and if you stick with do you wonder why you ca multitask again i ask why ca a unix or type o do all the miraculou thing with an ide harddrive that it can with a single scsi hard drive the mechanism alow the cpu to make request of the device on the scsi bu and then dettach and go about it busines later when the device be do it issue a callback to say that the datum ha arrive or the function ha complete most scsi card will also dma the datum into memory without the interupting the cpu therefore allow it to continue work uninterupted ide support no such concept a can you see how thi would be a win in any multitasking system david willmore willmore death before dishonor better dead than greek david willmore ever notice how much they look like orchid lovely
