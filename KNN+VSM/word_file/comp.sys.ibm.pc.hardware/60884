from penev penio penev subject re isa vlb xor eisa advice want on thu apr gmt ros mitchell rmitch write i want to use thi propose beast for basically fmy thing editing document use wordperfect under do creating datum use sigmaplot under do with image use aldu photostyler run under window these image can be large say x using the pc a an xterminal run and sun pc-nf talk to my network of sparcstation thi be where a lot of the come from and be the most demand of these task i read read read pc magazine perform benchmark read thi newsgroup and decide that a nice system would be cache isa vlb ram atus graphic ultra pro meg ram local bu monitor ni etherlink iius maxtor ide hard drive however the part do fit my local retailer apparently put one of these together only to discover that the atus card would run at surprise surprise actually after read thi group i surprise that they even have a local bu run i have a choice now between basically the above system but with a with isa and vlb or a with eisa and no vlb and thu the non-local bu version of the atus card which be better keep in mind that i primarily interest in the last two task having in mind the size of the image my opinion be to go with vlb it ha much more bandwith that eisa which in fact can be utilize by the craphic card i have not make measure so someone else may share experience on that also the be faster in the operation that run off internal cache slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory so my advice be the we quite happy with the atus card very fast once the datum get to it slow repaint image under photostyler that have move off screen or be uncover there do seem to be enough raw cpu when run it sluggish run the local window manager also many function under photostyler take a long time even when the image fit entirely in ram there not enough memory in the system and a meg smartdrive do leave much room for other app photostyler will page to disk with medium size image have you try run photostyler without the cache no need to have page and cache both well you might argue that the page be cache my belief no measurement be that app leave with more memory will manage it better than sy i have perform a number of benchmark on the ethernet transfer rate thi machine sustain only over ethernet while my sparc sustain on the same network going to the bite version of the smc card increase transfer rate to still very slow especially when move large image is there such a thing a a local-bu ethernet card come will it make a difference i hop so and lean toward the choice above for that reason the bandwidth theoretical of isa be over which be far from i try my isa ide hard drive maxtor and get the same result regardles of the isa bu speed so i gues that just the combination be lousy also be there on the horizon what about the rumor be that if any be the most likely chip to come out but note that ibm be closest to the technology an it will only sell whole motherboard so you have to upgrade the mb any information be greatly appreciate just some view not much figure penio penev w internet penev disclaimer all oppinion be mine
