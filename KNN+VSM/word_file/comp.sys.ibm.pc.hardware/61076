from jcmorri morri subject re soundblaster irq and port set discuss the use of irq in recent article msprague mike sprague write i a a number of poeple in thi thread have already write i ca prove it true but i believe it do not actually use even though that interrupt be suppose to be dedicate to to put it a little differently irq be the de facto standard interrupt assign to be use by the printer adapter to announce it completion of some activity do do monitor irq it use other mean to determine when it time to send out another byte to the printer most all hardware printer adapter have the ability to disable the use of irq usually by merely break the connection between the isa pin and the associate driver other adapter control the irq line by a tri-state driver and by program just leave it in the high-impedence mode unfortunately there be a lot of adapter card which use bistate driver either assert high or assert low for the irq line rather than tristate driver assert high assert low or do assert anything the presence of such a card on an irq line preclude the use of that irq by any other adapter unles it be physically disconnect by a jumper incidentally note that there no requirement that a card hold the irq line low when no interrupt be desire if that be true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq line and that certainly be a requirement non-do operate system nt variou unice or whatever the proper plural of unix might be require the use of irq for performance reason and the ala be one of the card which use bistate driver joe morri mitre jcmorri
