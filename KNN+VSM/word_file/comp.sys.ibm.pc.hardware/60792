from dlou denni lou subject re cpu temperature v cpu activity in article guyd guy dawson write in article montuno lino montuno write thi may be a very naive question but be there any basi for the claim that a cpu will get hotter when a computationally intensive job be run my friend claim that there will be little difference in the temperature of an idle cpu and a cpu run a computationally intensive job it first depend on what an idle cpu be do i not sure about do but many multitasking os have an loop like thi loop be there anything to do ye do it goto loop no goto loop the cpu be not do any work but it be still process instruction i do some asic and digital design but not any cpu design it would seem to me that on a the fpu be not be use most of the cache be not be access the off chip be idle the multiplier be multiply the barrel shifter be shift microcode be microcoding etc thi mean transistor be switch which mean le power dissipate in cmo which mean le heat from what i understand the pentium shut down those section of the cpu which be be use in order to cut down on denni lou but yossarian what if everyone think that way dlou then i be crazy to think any other way backbone ucsd dlou dlou steve job and steve wozniak go to my high school
