from wlsmith wayne smith subject re ide v scsi in article richk richard krehbiel write can anyone explain in fairly simple term why if i get i might need an scsi controler rather than an ide will performance suffer that much for a or so drive if i do have a tape drive or cd-rom any help would be appreciate so when you get multi-tasking you want to increase performance by increase the amount of overlap you do one way be with dma or bu master either of these make it possible for device to move their datum into and out of memory without interrupt the cpu the alternative be for the cpu to move the datum there be several scsi interface card that allow dma and bu master how do you do bus-mastering on the isa bu ide however be define by the standard at interface create for the ibm pc at which require the cpu to move all the datum byte with no dma if we talk isa at bu here then you can only have dma channel active at any one time presumably transfer datum from a single device so even though you can have at least device on a scsi bu explain how all of those device can to dma transfer through a single scsi card to the isa-at bu at the same time also i still try to track down a copy of ibm at reference book but from their pc technical manual page the fdd adapter be buffer on the bu and use the system board direct memory acces dma for record datum transfer i expect to see something similar for the pc-at hdd adapter so the lowly low-density original pc fdd card use dma and the pc-at hdd controller do that make real sense
