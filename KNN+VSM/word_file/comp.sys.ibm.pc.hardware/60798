from michael michael gerhard subject re modem and uart ryan jeffrey baucom rjbaucom write what be a uart i do know the exact mean of uart but i think it be something like universal arithmetic receiver transmitter normally the older board have a or uart on board those chip generate an irq for every char they receive the uart ha an internal byte buffer so with the right software instal it generate an irq every char what do it do for high-speed modem is it necessary for or higher throughput if you run do you do need a because do run only one task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be use for the transfer but if you be run a multitasking o such a unix etc window the cpu can not work the whole time with one task the result be lose character or break transmission because of timeout is it only for internal modem no the only diffrence be that internal modem have the uart on board wherea external modem be connect to the computer over a serial port which ha the uart on board if you have any experience with or higher speed modem please let me know what you think also any particular brand name reccomended or will a cheapo clone do just a well i use a with a under coherent i very satisfy with it but i think that nearly everyone be satisfy with hi own modem michael michael michael gerhard preussenstrasse germany neus voice
