from jr john switzer frame subject re cmo checksum error in article mcook michael cook write recently i have be get a cmo checksum error when i first turn on my computer it do happen everytime i turn it on nor can i predict when it be go to happen i have an ami bio and all of the set be lose for example the drive type and the password option however the date and time remain correct if anyone know what can be cause thi please let me know most likely reason be that ymy backup battery be fail thi battery maintain the content of the cmo memory when ac power be turn off and if the battery be flakey then the content of the cmo will be lose and the checksum will be wrong along with most other of the cmo datum try replace the battery if however ymy pc do use a battery but a large capacitor to power the cmo you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery if thi be possible make sure you leave ymy pc on for a half hmy or hmy each day thi will keep the capacitor charge i opt for the battery change though it also possible but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a viru be corrupt the cmo if ymy battery seem okay get a viru scanner and check out ymy system
