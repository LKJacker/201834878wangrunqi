from bgrubb grubb subject re ide v scsi david dave write be we talk about a device hd on a controller or be we talk about a controller that have a chip upgrade use the same chip that be on a controller board we be talk about a device hd on a controller here be a rewrite of my mac info sheet scsi section scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner nubu card expansion mac plu only some monitor and cd-rom normal asynchronou scsi be mhz fast synchronou scsi be mhz difference between these mode be mainly in the software driver main problem there be a lot of external device which be internal terminate which cause problem for more then two devise off the scsi port a scsi chain be suppose to be terminate only at the begin and end any other set up cause problem for either mac or ibm device per scsi controller asynchronou ave and synchronou max transfer be often mistake for a fast version of see for detail fully compliant mode device per scsi controller be implimented a a very fast since it can run use hardware and software driver which limit it to device which result in it sometime be mistakenly consitered part of and require different port electronic and scsi software driver from which make them more expensive than other scsi interface scsi seem to run only in synchronou mode hence term and fast scsi transfer speed be with burst with burst and with burst be the biggest headache due to the fact that it be the only that i know of that can pump speed through device and software controler it main implimentation be on the mac though you do see add for at maximum throughput for pc since do not need all the hardware include electonic and software of and it be the cheepest of the interface just pop out the electornic and pop in electronic some person consider where really start i used to be one of them but average though put with a theoretical burst of be not but be rule of thumb if it be scsin and over then it be some type of scsi can use part of electronic which further reduce it cost compare to and
