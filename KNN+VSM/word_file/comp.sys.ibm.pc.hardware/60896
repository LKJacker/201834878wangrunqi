from jamesc jame chuang subject re any info on cyrix chip it seem that there be a lot of question regard the cyrix compatible and my info come directly from cyrix fast fax service and also from instal one of these chip in an ibm model the be a instruction set compatible cpu which fit into a socket pin grid array or pga the dlc currently be available in speed the the and the they do not have a coprocessor on board but any software query will return coproc a present i gues they emulate the coproc instruction math function be on the level without the actual coprocessor the internal cache on the be cyrix literature claim a hit rate my informal test show that the cache account for a performance boost when it be enable by software overall performance boost from a to a be about the benchmark i use be nu si and qaplu dhrystone and whetstone the performance with the cache enable be about on a par with my with external cpu cache which be around the performance for a the computer run noticebly faster and do with dblspace be not complain the company claim compatibility but i do test it the be not a chip a commonly think the be actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the which contain the logic to manage the clock doubler thi board plug into the pga and the or plug into thi board i gues the board double the frequency apparent to the cpu and insert wait state when acces to the rest of the system be require there be no info available from cyrix there anyway the be available for and only double these clock rate and you get the and the dlc if cyrix be plan to do the same thing for the then they need to put out the first i also test a motherboard along with a cyrix coprocessor with external cache performance be about faster than the but still significantly slower than an actual intel imho the dlc be a great low price upgrade for person who ca afford or ca install a new motherboard it be definitely worth what i pay for it but if you need performance the wo cut it i not sure about the but i think even if it match the performance it wo beat it in any significant way the last time i post info about the dlc person send quite a bite of mail ask where i get it so here be where i get mine treasure chest peripheral they advertise in the computer shopper the kit wa but i like the chip so much that i find the supplier and become a dealer if you be interest in the chip e-mail me and i can fax or mail you more info i well aware of the net policy against commercial use so i can t post anymore info here however if there be more question regard the itself i post what i can jamesc if someone ask if you be a god you say ye
