from russest steve russell subject re cpu fan in article nmp write just get a system and be consider get a fan for the cpu the processor when run be too hot to touch so i think thi be a fairly good idea long ago when i do some electronic train i read somewhere that the region within a chip that define etc slowly diffuse over time and thi increase with temperature hence a hot chip go off-spec sooner ha anyone out there get a cpu fan ye is there more than type ye see glue-on tape-on clip-on one-inch square and larger my favorite be the inch plastic fan i use just plop down on top of the chip during open-case service do you have to remove the cpu from it scoket to install the fan depend on the mount do all cpu fan derive their power from spare drive power line only if the manufacturer wa smart anyone have any trouble with cpu fan only if it go out get that blanket effect which do help chip life do anyone have any evidence that cpu fan be a complete waste of money longer system life make good economic sense to me how be these fan attach glue clip melt cheese ye well not the melt cheese roughly how much cooler will the cpu be with a fan a oppose to without let you touch the surface the rule of thumb for cool solid-state an advert i read claim v any info appreciate the attach fan look slick and work well but i bother by the potential los of cool if the fan go out at least with the power supply fan you can reach back there every few day and feel the fan blow i prefer to put a stock fan off the drive bracket or front panel to blow air acros the cpu depend a lot on case and board layout though on-chip fan from fry electronic in the sf bay area be about i get the stock power supply fan for about steve
