from drice d keith rice subject re compatibility thank to all who respond to my original post i get the number for western digital tech support and determine that i need to upgrade the bio to the super bio it will handle hard drife with up to read write head and up to cylinder the upgrade be payable by check or money order send to western digital corporation technical support group box irvine ca the super bio be for any wd xt hard drive controller card in the series the bio on my system would only handle up to drife the response to my request for help follow my sig warning it long keith d keith rice university of north texa department of computer science denton texa usa drice drice response below from ravalent sat apr received from by ponder id sat apr from ravalent bob valentine received from by id sat apr est received by id sat apr est date sat apr est message-id to drice ponder statu or to drice subject re compatibility newsgroup in-reply-to ponder organization syracuse university syracuse ny cc in article ponder you write i recently buy a use seagate hard drive the guy tell me that it have be fully test and that it wa good i take it home to install in my compaq portable ok i a little behind in technology i already have an mfm controller i instal the drive and power up the system i get a post error my controller be a western digital rev c a i say above the drive be a seagate the system be a compaq portable circa ah finally a question i can answer i me with thi older stuff alot kinda fun first problem i can forsee be that the will not be compadible with that wd card unles it ha the right bio rom check the number on it it should be the only non-smt chip on the board slightly below center and leave the bio should read either or if the last digit be you get problem controller jumper be set a follow represent jumper look right and be factory jump with a trace between pin and to select the primary controller addres the drive jumper be a follow represent jumper look right art delete here be my question are the drive and controller compatible w each other i notice you leave out the jumper table set those be what control what drive the controller think it ha if you have the rom set it like thi open open open open close close open open note those be how wd run the number on the jumper block top to bottom represent the jumper pin pin and select the first drive set drive and pin and select the second drive drive if you have the rom it a auto-config and i have to look up how to do it i do have the big book right here are the jumper on the set correctly see above you might have problem if the jumper be not right also at the risk of be insult make sure the cable be on right and good on the jumper on the try move it to the opposite side of the drive it one or the other the narrow datum cable go to i throw it on a few time and bang my head for a day is my system bio in need of an upgrade dunno ibm rom have to be later than a quick way to check be to boot do and run debug enter d fffc the be the debug prompt thi will return the rom date if it of any use keith rice if i oversimplify any of the above i appologize it just hard to know what caliber of person i talk to bob valentine ravalent from chpp mon apr received from by ponder id mon apr received by id mon apr gmt message-id from chpp prof p piacenza subject to drice ponder date mon apr gmt x-mailer elm version mime-version content-type content-transfer-encoding content-length statu or if you be use a twisted cable then move the jumper on ymy drive to the neighbour pin make sure that the twist cable be for a hard disk and not a floppy disk the colour stripe pin should be furthest from the twist thi may also help product for xt system hard disk
