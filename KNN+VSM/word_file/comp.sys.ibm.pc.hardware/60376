from wlsmith wayne smith subject re ide v scsi in article wayne grn by mike schwartz michael b smith write but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bu when it come to multi-tasking o when manage datum from a single scsi hard drive a scsi controller that transfer datum by dma allow the cpu to request datum from the hard drive and continue work while the controller get the datum and move it to memory ide also use dma technique i believe floppy controller also use dma and most board also use dma dma be no big deal and ha nothing to do directly with scsi for example when rewinding or format a tape the command be issue to the controller and the bu be release to allow acces to other device on the bu thi greatly increase productivity or at least do something else while back up ymy hard drive which happen to be what i be do while read thi group you can thank ymy software for that if do have a few more brain it could format floppy etc while you be do something else the hardware will support it but do at least wo again thi ha nothing to do with scsi it a long story but i still use ide on my except for the cdrom which thank to scsi i can move between both machine if and when scsi be better standardize and support on the ibm-clone machine i plan to completely get rid of ide and if you stick with do you wonder why you ca multitask again i ask why ca a unix or type o do all the miraculou thing with an ide harddrive that it can with a single scsi hard drive
