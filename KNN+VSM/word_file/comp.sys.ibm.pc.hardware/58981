from glang gordon lang subject re ibm acifuent acifuent write hi i will change my soon and i read something about the ibm p value-point anyone have one the video card be really a bite card how much cost in and the last question can the p value point sx upgrade to a thank you veeery much in advance alejandro cifuente h acifuent these question can be answer by any dealer of ibm value point but i will provide some unsolicited advice the most amuse kind of advice today tueday ibm be suppose to officially announce the introduction of the vesa local bu value point system these system still have on-board video and disk which be far better than the prior value point system and you get vesa local bu for future upgrade we be go to buy three of them with monitor also a newly available and one of the three will immediately be upgrade to ultrastor cache scsi disk controller and either the atus gup or the viper graphic board do not buy a sytem my personal philosophy on upgrade policy be that it be not loss-free when you earn money you pay taxe when you spend money you pay taxe they get you come and go translated thi mean take infrequent but large step you be far better off short term and long term if you avoid the sx model and go straight to the dx or model gordon
