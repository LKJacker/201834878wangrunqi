from jliukkon juha-mattus liukkonen subject re soundblaster irq and port set paul bartholomew write clip clip interesting would you care to explain to me then how my soundblaster pro card and my printer card be share irq successfully i assure you that they be both set to irq and that i have no problem my computer be a dtk ibm clone running ms-do or a derivative o obviously please take note that the follow be not what exactly happen but a slightly simplify explanation technically the irq line be only a mean for the device printer adapter soundblaster modem hard disk to signal the cpu that something happen here please take note how the cpu be program to handle thi signal be usually up to the operate system in ms-do the interrupt vector be use to store the addres of the function that handle each interrupt now basic do do care whether the printer report that it ready to print some more stuff or not it simply ignore the interrupt when do print it look at the lpt buffer if there a character there wait a while and check again if there not copy a new character to the lpt port since the irq be ignore a a printer interrupt it free for use for any other adapter in thi case the sb with any multitasking or otherwise advance o thi kind of print approach just do work or more precisely it waste a lot of cpu cycle hence you ca share the irq with and sb if you run unix or or whatnot another issue with the sb be that only the digitize sound use interrupt when the sb play plain music the cpu simply tell it what to play until tell otherwise with digitize sound the interrupt be require to notify the cpu when the output end and new datum be need you can however hook two or more com port to one interrupt but use them only one at a time thi be because the interrupt handle routine be same for both port and it can see from which port the datum come from thi of course apply for some other device like lpt a well remember thi wa greatly simplify in part but i think gife the general picture correctly enough cheer juha liukkonen aka jliukkon university of helsinki dept of lost soul trust me i know what i do sledge hammer
