from guyd guy dawson subject re scsi or ide the bottom line in article randy ellingson write which would you choose and why i have both i have ide only on my dro box and ide and scsi on my unix box ide on the dro box it only ha a hard disk scsi on my unix box it ha a scsi hard disk cd-rom and tape i buy scsi a it make add many device easier for the price of one irq and dma i have three different type of device connect up faster drife be also available for scsi i have a dec that realy do have a average seek time it find datum faster than my toshiba drive like lot of person i really like to increase my datum transfer rate from the hard drive right now i have a ide drive seagate and a standard ide controller card on my isa i do think that scsi will increase ymy datum transfer much on an isa bu i currently think about add another hd in the to range and i think hard about buy a scsi drive scsi for the future benefit i believe i get something like transfer right now accord to nu be pretty good how would thi number compare if i buy the state-of-the-art scsi card for my isa pc and the state-of-the-art scsi hard drive the best system i could hope for many state of the art scsi disk use the same mechanical a many state of the art ide drife only the interface electroni differ look at the fijitsu drive for an example obviously money factor into thi choice a well a any other but what would you want to use on ymy isa system and how much would it cost i use an adaptec on my unix box and no-name ide card on both along those line what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd if i be to buy the top-of-the-line ide cache controller for my hd and how much would it cost caching controller why what do it give you that smartdrive for do do not about extra lower memory that about it a properly configure main memory cache will produce better result than a cache controller my unix read read datum from it main memory cache at that faster than the standard isa bu can ever sustain thank for any comment randy guy guy dawson hoskyn group plc guyd tel hoskyn uk guyd tel ibm austin usa
