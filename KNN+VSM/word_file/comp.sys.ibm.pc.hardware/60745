from anisko anisko subject re atarus mono and vga in article arosborn alan osborn write in article max brante write have anybody succeded in convert a atarus monomchrome monitor into a mono vga monitor if so please let me know exactly how you do and what graphic card you use i wish i could help i post a similar question about two week ago i get no response at all i ask locally at my friendly atarus store i wa tell that it should be possible but that they have no idea how it might be do nor do they particularly care to investigate please if anyone ha any suggestion post them you might try ask on one of the echo the best one may be i say thi because the conversion seem more gear toward a pc user want to use that monitor than an atarus user who already can use the monitor unles maybe they want to really go wild convert the monitor to vga then use it a a vga monitor with a falcon a for graphic card assume that the atarus monitor can be to handle vga signal you should probably be able to use any vga card at least with a re around i have try thi but that would be my gues robert anisko anisko you might want to price mono vga monitor anyway it may be cheaper to go that route than to do the conversion beside with the falcon and beyond monitor will probably be the way to go
