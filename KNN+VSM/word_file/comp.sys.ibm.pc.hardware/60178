from wlsmith wayne smith subject re ide v scsi in article bgrubb grubb write point of view why do scsi have an advantage when it come to multus task datum be datum and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster do it have a better cache system i think scsi wa good at manage a datum bu when multiple device be attach if we be only talk about a single drive explain why scsi be inherently faster at manage datum from a hard drive ide integrated device electronic currently the most common standard and be mainly use for medium size drife can have more than one hard drive asynchronou transfer max why do you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bu first you can quote scsi spec till you blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bu capability then what the point who say ide be limit to what about vlb-ide do anyone know how they perform so at it lowest set interface in asynchronou mode average the through put maximum of ide in asynchronou mode in full mode it blow poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can a implimented on what system the problem become can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rate and that be where the bottleneck and cost of come from not the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisim to use the through put given the original question scsi use only a a single hard drive controller be it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least maybe for the scsi choice to make any sence what do a meg scsi drive cost the cost of scsi interface be a self fulliling prophisy few person buy scsi because it be so expencive for the pc which in turn convice make that ma produce scsi which would reduce it cost be unwarented and so scsi be expencive that be the effect of the rule of scale the more item sell the le each item ha to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the le each item ha to cost the original cga cart back in wa i think the original ega card or pga wa scsi ha stand relatively alone in not come down in price mainly because we talk about pc and not sun or sparc or sgi or name ymy favorite unix workstation that be after million of pc buy decision over the year scsi ha have plenty of time to come down in price i wo argue that the scsi standard make for a good well implimented datum highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bu when it come to multi-tasking o when manage datum from a single scsi hard drive
