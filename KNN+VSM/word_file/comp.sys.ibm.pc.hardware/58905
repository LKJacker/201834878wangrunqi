from andrei andrei yakovlev subject how to program a pc keyboard itself hi all i have hear that somewhere there exist programmable keyboard eg one can program display on the key to show some specific character do it mean that there be some way of transmit some non-trivial datum to the kb a oppose to standard numlock on-off typeamatic spec from inside the pc software i have not find any correspond reference in the spec for the pc-kb interface anyone have any idea except that they may encode datum by the sequence of the standard command mention above which would look too neat beside what would one do from an xt great thank in advance andrew
