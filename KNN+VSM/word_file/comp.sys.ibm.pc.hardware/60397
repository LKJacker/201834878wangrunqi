from eyal eyal lebedinsky subject re for joystick be slow in liones write i use to read my joystick and it be hideously slow something like of my cpu time be be spend read the joystick and thi be in a program that do nothing but printf and joyread if you only do then there be no reason for the joystick stuff not to take of the time even if it be efficient the problem be that a lot of program trap like smartdrv and so it be a slow a hell interface can i read the joystick port in a reasonably safe fashion vium poll and that be platform or clockspeed specific the truth be that int joystick read is slow i read it directly from the hardware port note that do so expose you to intermittent disturbance from interrupt so you may want to read say twice in a row and keep the lower result do just turn interrupt off it may prove detrimental to the health of any high speed comm and other device here be an example of how to do thi an example of how to read pc joystick port by poll the hardware port directly use inp outp for byte port acces will timeout when count up to zero thi sample read one port a be present and b be in the comment you can read both at once by merge the two but it will time out when either joystick be not connect there be no need to optimize thi routine since it run for a long a the joystick circuitry need written by eyal lebedinsky eyal include include include extern int readjoy int x int y int int define joyport define xjoy for joystick b use define yjoy for joystick b use define xymask define for joystick b use define for joystick b use int return if ok readjoy int x int y int int register int count register char temp joy temp char xymask count outp joyport set trigger do temp joy char inp joyport if temp xjoy x count if temp yjoy y count while count temp joy xymask joy joy return count thi main be for demonstration int main int rc x y printf hit any key to while kbhit rc readjoy x y printf r d d d rc x y
