from bgrubb grubb subject re ide v scsi write scsi-i range from scsi-ius range from ide range from esdi be alway although there be some non-standard version the above do not tell the proper story of scsi scsi-i asynchronou ave synchronou max transfer base faster thi require a controller chip and provide to speed with controler with burst with burst and with burst and fast scsi can be wide or fast it depend on how the port be design the quadra will support fast scsi but not wide when the o scsi manager be rewrite since the quarda use a non-wide port the article in pc mag wa talk about use ten device in it native mode outside it native mode it behave a lot like device slower through put from ymy own figure be indeed twice esdi a the article point out a for faster then ide that seem to be use a contoler chip the mac quadra use a controler chip for it and get through put for asynchronou far in exces of a normal synchronou output of be which be near the burst of a machine with a controller chip the pc world seem to have and mix up fact be controler chip allow near speed through a device a show in the mac quadra which skew some of the datum of v ide or esdi test i agree that the article could have state that the faster then ide come off a device with a chip maybe it wa there and the editor kill it because the article wa deal with not and he do not understand the effect of a device with a controller chip chip be limit to max device with chip become common produce up to in mode and in mode the fast version port can not use wide scsi of cource the prime piece of wierdnes be that device have chip or more accurately the machine do thi allow the best of both world high speed and cheeper cost full hardware port electronic controller etc be very expensive it also create a logistic nightmare a to how fast go when one know the fact behind the number then one realize that the article know what it be talk about even if it do not tell how the figure come about while be throw out range that do tell squat since he ignore device with chip hi range tell even les then intend
