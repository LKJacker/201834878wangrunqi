from stam david stam subject re recommendation for a local bu cache penio penev penev write i have a maxtor on an isa ide controller although my machine be vlb i ha the save transfer rate of regardles of the variation of the isa bu speed i test it with speed between and not any difference the problem be not the interface between the controller and the memory chri brinton brinton write i also have a and a maxtor i have a local bu ide controller generic and i get i try swap my local bu ide controller for an isa ide controller and my transfer rate go to the spec for thi drive show a maximum platter to controller transfer rate of i dont know how to get there from here the local bu interface get me a little but certainly not a much a i have hop i be also look for a way to what be the deal with the ide transfer rate is anybody get throughput anywhere close to the platter controller rate i have see anything even close to the limit of the ide interface these drife be non-interleaved be they here be the rate i get sequential read msdo c program that use bio call to read block sequentially from outside first track inward bu bu maxtor quantum disk buffer read same c program but re-read the same block repeatedly so in effect be read the ram buffer on the drive bu bu maxtor quantum coretest transfer rate seem to agree with above bu bu maxtor quantum i manage to get hold of the quantum product manual and it go into excrutiating detail describe how the bite get from the platter through the controller and out the ide interface nowhere do i see anything like after the bite be whip of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they be send to the host even though i swear that what happen here be some relevent quote from the manual datum be transfer from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of maximum minimum my calculation show maximum and minimum disk spin at rpm with sector per track on the outside and on the inside single burst error of up to bite within one sector can be correct in real time a they occur allow a high degree of datum integrity with no impact to the drive performance i take thi to mean error correction be the bottleneck for page-mode operation the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer ram be up to thi high transfer rate allow the at interface ic to communicate over the at bu at a data-transfer rate of while the dc simultaneously control disk-to-ram transfer so the thing can even do it cache pre-fetch while it send the request sector it ha read buffer for pre-fetching i gues you could call that a cache so when i do a sequential read on the outer track why be i get a measly when i should be get around any of you hard-disk engineer out there know wondering why my disk be so slow david o o ooo ooo david stam linux the choice of a gnu generation stam
