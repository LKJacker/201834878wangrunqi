from bgrubb grubb subject re ide v scsi richk richard krehbiel write stuff about the connection between ide and ida deleated clock bite width if ide speed come from ida where do the sight for ide come from scsi be not complex it be just the way the industry use and talk about it there be three key difference in scsi the controller chip the port and the software that is it let u look a scsi in from thi stand point asynchronou and synchronou mode software scsi driver only asynchronou be slower then synchronou mode only v synchronou speed can be reach by most divice with a rewrite of the software driver a be the case for the mac quadra thi be the main source for the confusion thi differ from only in the controler chip in most machine in the mac and some pc thi be call because it use port and software driver and can produce speed through inspite of thi even in the slower asynchronou mode average speed in asynchronou mode with see in both quadra and higher end pc synchronou mode just allow a higher burst rate two wide require two thing over a software driver and a wide scsi port on the machine and the external device fast also require two thing over driver software and that the recieving devise support fast speed of both be the same with burst also know a wide and fast scsi over thi require driver software wide port and that the recieving device also have a mode chip a expect thi be very expencive speed with burst a i say simple seven version of scsi seperated by software the controler chip and the port standarize the software and it drop to only five version of scsi seperate by only hardware the chip and the port
