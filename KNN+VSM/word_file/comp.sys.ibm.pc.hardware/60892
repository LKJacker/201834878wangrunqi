from jim jim graham subject re courier v sportster note followup to for obviou reason in article andy nicola write in a previou article holly ks say what be the difference between the u robotic courier external and the sportster external i see that the price of a sportster ha dramatically drop to below but the price of the courier remain above anyone with knowledge of both of these modem or anyone that own a courier the courier be their top-of-the-line product thu the higher price i never take a real look at the sportster line only courier but from what i gather it basically more of an entry-level modem probably do meet the same specification that the courier do i not sure if the sportster line be fully dsp drive like the more recent courier modem be so upgrade in the future may be an issue again take all of the above with a grain of salt i never evaluate the sportster so i go by bite and piece that i hear if you want a real answer post the question in and you find person who have work with the sportster personally though if i be go to look at the courier modem i buy the dual standard then i get both hst and in fact thi be exactly what i do i sit here look at my usr d right now and now to correct a few very incorrect statement folk if you want to get reliable answer to modem uart question post them to if you post in other group you never know what you get in the way of an answer you may very well get a good answer or you may get something like the one below at least in cdm if someone post complete and utter b you see a flurry of folk correct them to avoid spread faulty info the sportster at ha error control and bi datum compression just a it do at lower speed too there be absolutely nothing in either ccitt recommendation or that say that they can only operate on modem that be run of course be currently only standardized for operation on top of in it primary mode of operation lapm but that about a far a that go and just in case there some confusion on thi be also support by the courier line unles you have a really ancient one the difference with the courier be that it can run at and only in the hst mode take a second look at the original question in a previou article holly ks say what be the difference between the u robotic courier external see the up there the question wa not about the courier hst modem or about the courier dual standard it wa about the courier modem the modem in question do not support hst period it therefore do not support the kb hst also not all courier hst courier dual standard modem support the kb version of hst my dual standard only support hst at kb there be even older model that only run hst at kb thi be a proprietary mode of usr and it will only connect to another of the same type unit to achieve thi speed hst be usr proprietary modulation scheme but we not talk about hst we talk about be most definitely not a proprietary modulation scheme the sportster will do asynchronou transmission a well a synchronou the hst be one way only i do hope you do mean for these two sentence to be relate in some way first off and be both synchronou and asynchronou thi be part of the ccitt recommendation part of the standard it be a feature unique to the sportster i just look at the appropriate chapter in the courier d manual second hst be not one way only more correctly put it be an asymmetrical modulation scheme mean it do work at the same speed in both direction hst operate at in one direction and ha a low-speed back-channel in the other direction the high-speed channel go in the direction of the higher datum flow thi be fine if you log on to say a bb and type one letter and get screen of info back transfer file not use bimodem etc there be of course a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel need to reverse direction and be both symmetrical mean they do transfer the full datum rate in both direction at the same time third synchronou v asynchronou ha absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical v asymmetrical they be two completely different topic the hst will be upgradeable to the spec when it be available again more correctly put some of the courier line will be upgradeable to whatever be call when it complete if you have the large footprint courier modem like i do you there wa an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which could eventually be upgrade to support but the cost of the two upgrade together pretty much put it higher than just buy a new modem later jim include de internet jim icbm amateur radio ft walton beach fl amtor selcal nial e-mail me for information about kamterm host mode for kantronic tnc
