from bgrubb grubb subject re ide v scsi wlsmith wayne smith write thi do answer the original question is a multi-user o and no mention wa make of an ether card either but from a point of view why do scsi have an advantage when it come to multus task datum be datum and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster do it have a better cache system i think scsi wa good at manage a datum bu when multiple device be attach if we be only talk about a single drive explain why scsi be inherently faster at manage datum from a hard drive you be make the same mistake i do you be confuse the drive interface to the datum throughput interface again from my mac ibm info sheet available by ftp on in the a expansion both mac ibm scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner nubu card expansion mac plu only some monitor and cd-rom apple develop some specification for scsi controler while ibm ha no exact controller specification which result in add incompatibility on ibm machine main problem there be a lot of external device which be internal terminate which cause problem for more then two devise off the scsi port a scsi chain be suppose to be terminate only at the begin and at the end any other set up cause problem for either mac or ibm device per scsi controller asynchronou ave and synchronou max transfer base require a controler chip and can provide only fast not wide which be both interface see device per scsi controller in mode be fully complient and tend to be implimented a a very fast since it need a different controller interface in both hardware which tend to be very expendsive and software transfer speed be with burst with burst and with burst and fast in mode be limit to device and reduce or fast only throughput due to the difference between and wide port ibm hd interface limit to hard drife by design or lack of development ide integrated device electronic currently the most common standard and be mainly use for medium size drife can have more than one hard drive asynchronou transfer max so at it lowest set interface in asynchronou mode average the through put maximum of ide in asynchronou mode in full mode it blow poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can the problem become can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rate and that be where the bottleneck and cost of come from not the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisim to use the through put the cost of scsi interface be a self fulliling prophisy few person buy scsi because it be so expencive for the pc which in turn convice make that ma produce scsi which would reduce it cost be unwarented and so scsi be expencive that be the effect of the rule of scale the more item sell the le each item ha to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the le each item ha to cost allow a drive mechanisim through put to be limit by the drive while ide itself limit the through put
