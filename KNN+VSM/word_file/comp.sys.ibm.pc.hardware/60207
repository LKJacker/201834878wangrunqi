from darrylo darryl okahatum subject re problem with adaptec scsi and jumbo tape drive ron mastu ronaldm write i just replace my exist dtc scsi controller with an adaptec and be now have trouble restore from a jumbo tape drive here a document that i write some time back it slightly out-of-date now that do ha be release but much of it be still useful darryl okahatum internet darrylo disclaimer thi message be the author personal opinion and do not constitute the support opinion or policy of hewlett-packard or of the little green man that have be follow him all day id darrylo rel darrylo hint and tip for the adaptec scsi adapter thi document contain hint and tip for get the adaptec scsi adapter to work with variou hardware and software package they be base upon my experience with an adaptec controller and will hopefully help other however note that i can not guarantee that the follow will really help you it work for me and the information in thi document could possibly cause you

customer topic cover in thi document window enhance mode floppy-controller-based tape backup device sound card miscellaneou info please note that part of thi document contain technical and sometime terse description of problem for reference adaptec technical support adaptec bb please send comment correction etc vium email to me compuserve internet darrylo window enhance mode the window install program should automatically configure do and window for use with the adaptec however just in case something go wrong i go to describe some of the change need to get window work with the also you may have notice that instal window make ymy pc run much slower even when you not run window method of speed it up be discuss in the section call window run slowly msdo configuration the window install program add the smartdrive disk cache to ymy and file if you follow the instruction you notice that you need to use double-buffering with smartdrive thi be the default setup you also notice that ymy system run much much slower in both window and msdo see the section call window run slowly for some way of speed ymy system up window configuration to get the adaptec to work with window make sure that the section of the file contain the entry i believe that the window install program automatically add thi entry to but i not sure if thi do work for you you might want to try add some more line you probably do need the above line though the systemrombreakpoint entry be use to enable support for memory manager like only need if you use such program window run slowly once you do get window run with the chance be that ymy system be run much slower than before if it not it probably because you happen to be use version in ymy file congratulation thi appear to be a win solution you be very lucky whether ymy luck will hold out remain to be see if ymy system be run much slower than before thi be almost definitely cause by smartdrive with double-buffering according to the window documentation and the microsoft technical note smartdrive double buffering required with you must use smartdrive with double-buffering enable while thi work it really slow down ymy pc i once estimate that thi slow my pc down by a factor of five a i consider thi unacceptable i look for other solution unfortunately you can not just disable double-buffering if you do window in enhance mode will not work and you might even destroy the content of ymy hard disk by try to run window what you can do be one of the follow use other driver that provide double-buffering it be my opinion that the unbelievable slownes in smartdrive be cause either by horribly inefficient double-buffering or by a bug in smartdrive use a driver that provide vd service vd stand for virtual dma service thi be a standard which be support by window that allow bus-mastering disk controller like the to work with window after trash my hard disk countles time i find the follow solution none of which require use smartdrive note however that i be now get occasional parity error which be probably not cause by these solution but might be see below while the follow do not require smartdrive use some kind of disk cache utility be strongly recommend a thi make window run much much faster if you do not have the driver or you do not need aspus function for control a cdrom tape drive more than two physical hard disk etc you can add the driver to ymy file window need the option thi driver must be load into low memory it can not be load into high memory and it occupy about a of november the driver could be obtain from the adaptec bb at hopefully it still there if you need aspus function and have the driver version or you can use both the and driver in ymy file amazingly enough the driver can also be load high assume you have do i would have think that thi would crash my system but it do i ask adaptec technical support about thi and they say that load high should be fine a long a be load low on my system not use with would occasionally cause window to crash upon restart or exit window with the additional result of a corrupt disk some of my c file would be corrupt for me these crash usually occur while make a different program from the default window shell and vice-versa thi be the reason may be necessary i have absolutely no idea if be necessary with version of earlier than note that many person can use or without they do not seem to have any problem at all i consider these person lucky other like me have have all sort of problem in my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution be to upgrade to the driver be no longer need unfortunately while you could get previou upgrade from the adaptec bb the driver be not available from the adaptec bb a far a i know there be only three way to get a copy you can buy the new a of november adaptec ez scsi driver kit which supposedly include a well a other driver such a cdrom driver i believe the list price be around if you already have a copy of an older version of you can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it to ez scsi for around a copy of be include in central point pc tool for msdo note that the documentation and driver be store in different directory note further that only be include the cdrom driver and driver to support more than two hard disk be not include thi be where i obtain my copy of note however that i be now get occasional parity error with window in all probability defective hardware in my pc be cause thi a i upgrade my motherboard just after i find the above solution however because these parity error occur only during disk access there be a very small but definite possibility that the parity error be driver-related for example change the bu time for certain disk transfer might cause thi i run variou memory test for hour at a time and these test have find no problem thi problem be probably cause by memory with marginal time requirement which cause parity error during disk transfer thi be why the memory test do find any problem the problem show up only under disk however i mention thi just in case it be a hardware problem floppy-controller-based tape backup device there be two possible problem with use the adaptec with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device such a the colorado memory system jumbo tape can take a very long time the tape drive constantly start stop start stop etc tape operation may be erratic or encounter too many tape error thi problem might be cause by defective hardware on my however i hear of other person have similar problem and so i mention thi just in case it be not a hardware problem on my tape take a long time if you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device you may have to adjust the adaptec bu time for best result when use the tape drive normally while do a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously run with only an occasional pause however the default bu time on the adaptec may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few second thi cause needle wear to the tape and tape drive however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause thi make sure ymy tape head be clean thi also cause the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than necessary the problem here be that these tape backup use the floppy dma to transfer datum in memory the tape drive and the adaptec use dma to transfer datum in memory the hard disk the floppy dma need to fee datum to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive be not feed datum quickly enough by the floppy dma the tape drive stop rewind a bite and restart once enough datum be eventually feed to it the default bu time on the adaptec which be really dma time be too large for example when a backup be do datum ha to be transfer from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape because the default time on the adaptec hog the memory too much too much time be spend transfer datum from a hard disk to memory not enough time be spend transfer datum from memory to the tape drive a a result the tape drive constantly start and stop because datum be not feed to it quickly enough the solution be to change the adaptec bu time the default factory set be microsecond on and microsecond off the bu on time need to be lower to microsecond thi can be do in one of two way if you have you can use the n option for example i use a bu on time of microsecond which mean that i use the follow line in my file note that there be no space between the n and the if you do have ymy only recourse be to try to find a program call which be very difficult to find the reason be that adaptec for reason of their own do not seem to want thi widely distribute i once ask someone who work for adaptec and they ask me to not upload it anywhere if you have anonymou ftp acces to the internet you could try use archie to hunt down a copy i believe that there be a couple of site that have it if you do find a copy you run it like so setscsi thi adjust the bu on time to microsecond running without any argument reset the bu time back to the factory default note that it seem that you can not use if you use crash my system if wa load i could use with however do not lower the bu on time below microsecond or increase it above microsecond if you lower it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop ymy system will feel slower for me microsecond work fine thi value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downward a little once you lower the bu on time tape backup and restore should run faster also do not experiment with the bu time with the other option that i have intentionally not describe unles you know what you be do bad combination can cause parity error and worse by starve memory refresh a program call exist on the adaptec bb unles thi ha be upgrade since i last check which ha be a while thi be a self-extracting archive contain a batch file and a couple of other file thi batch file wa suppose to allow one to set the bu time for the and other however when i try run thi program with my my system crash at the time i wa run and i do check to see if there wa a conflict with it maybe thi old program work only with the although the doc say that it work with the erratic tape operation or too many tape error thi problem may or may not exist although it exist on my system a hardware problem just on my particular could cause it however i hear of other person have similar problem and so i mention thi just in case it be a hardware problem just on my symptom of thi problem which persist even after clean the tape head backing up to tape encounter unusable sector detect error result in an abort tape backup tape backup work but the tape compare fail the tape drive start stop start stop etc much too often unlike the above-mentioned problem tape take a long time where the tape drive start and stop every few second thi kind of occur every few second or so fastback plu do not any tape backup device other program like central point backup and the cm jumbo software assume that you have a cm jumbo tape drive can the tape drive but fastback plu can not too many tape read error although i do not know what be cause thi problem i discover that use a different floppy controller solf it a few month ago i upgrade my motherboard which contain an integrate floppy controller a i already have a floppy controller on the i initially disable the motherboard floppy controller after a while i decide to try disable the floppy controller and use the one on the motherboard when i do thi the tape drive a cm jumbo reliability increase dramatically and fastback plu wa suddenly able to find and use the tape drive i do know if thi wa cause by a hardware problem on my on the one hand the floppy drife work great when they be attach to the which seem to say that there wa nothing wrong with the on the other hand the tape drive do work well attach to the floppy controller but it do work when attach to a different controller thi could be an indication of a hardware problem on my i do change floppy drive cable and so it be conceivable that the problem wa in the cable i do know what the cause really be however if you have similar problem you might want to consider try a new floppy controller sound card many popular sound card can play or record digitize sound and thi be typically do use dma like the tape drive dma the adaptec dma can conflict with the sound card dma unlike that of the tape dma thi conflict usually manifest itself a a parity error ymy system crash with a parity error message what happen be that datum be be transfer so quickly by the sound card and the adaptec memory refresh can not occur quickly enough which cause a parity error usually get a parity error mean that there be a hardware problem with ymy system in thi case however the parity error be not a symptom of bad hardware i find that such parity error typically occur while record digitize sound and the chance of such error increase a you increase the record fidelity higher sample rate record in stereo record use instead of etc like the tape drive solution the solution here be to lower the adaptec bu on time see the section on tape drife for information on how thi be do note however that thi may or may not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity error the software use to record digitize sound can greatly affect thi problem some software be inefficient disk cach the speed of ymy hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect thi miscellaneou info thi section contain miscellaneou hint tip and rumor much of it be merely information that i hear or read about and have not verify i believe that the follow information be correct but i not sure use it at ymy own risk with qemm and you need to specify the db parameter unles you be use the driver if you do qemm will at bootup although the qemm manual mention thi the install program do not seem to detect that a be present and automatically add thi option to the qemm command line at least thi occur with the qemm install program i have test any other version earlier version of qemm probably need thi parameter but i not sure i never use a version earlier than if you use you do not need to give qemm the db parameter some or all version of the do not support hard disk over one gigabyte in size to support hard disk with capacity over you need to get a new rom bio from adaptec i not sure if thi be still true of the latest be sell by adaptec to connect a cdrom drive to the you need a scsi cdrom drive and some driver note that some cdrom drife have proprietary interface non-scsi these drife can not be use with the you have three choice for cdrom driver i have no idea how well the follow solution work or even if they work the follow be secondhand information you can buy adaptec ez scsi driver package which list for something like if you already have older adaptec driver you can supposedly upgrade to ez scsi for around contact adaptec for detail the ez scsi package supposedly contain everything that you need you can buy the corelscsi driver package which be make by the same person that make coreldraw thi package contain cdrom driver scsi tape driver worm driver etc i do not know the list price but i see thi package sell for around note that corelscsi do not come with the driver which be need if you do not already have you may be better off get adaptec ez scsi instead thi method be obsolete a the follow driver have be obsoleted by adaptec ez scsi kit but i mention it in case someone already ha these driver you can use the driver in the adaptec kit and the kit aspus cdrom driver you will have to get a copy of a high-level cdrom driver if it be not include in the kit but thi be available from several bulletin board to use a scsi tape drive with the you need software that know how to talk to a scsi tape drive software that i hear about be again like the above section on cdrom drife i have no idea how well the follow solution work or even if they work the follow be secondhand information central point pc tool for msdo supposedly support a large number of scsi tape drife it come with scsi driver a well a central point backup the corelscsi driver package contain a scsi tape backup program see the above section on cdrom drife for more detail however note that corelscsi do not come with but require i see advertisement that sell the in three configuration scsi controller with hard disk rom bio scsi controller and adaptec aspus driver scsi controller adaptec aspus driver and corelscsi i imagine that adaptec now sell the in a fourth configuration scsi controller and ez scsi driver include aspus driver those person who use unix might be interest in a version of gnu tar for msdo that talk to a scsi tape drive vium the driver you need thi driver before you can use thi program i never use thi version of gnu tar but i hear that it work i do know how well though if you have anonymou ftp acces to the internet a copy can be find on and mirror site gnu tar for scsi tape drife adaptec patch for aspibin relative to gnu tar src for gnu tar for scsi tape adaptec ctrlr i have no idea if a copy can be find on compuserve unixforum might have it if any forum do a far a msdo be concern the and the controller be the same with msdo the should work a well a the however the hardware for these two board be not identical and there be at least one non-msdo program that initially do not work with a but do work with a a version of bsd unix in case anyone curiou here an edit copy of my file d on ram rom st m umb shell c p note that i use qemm and if i be use or i probably have to use a that look like d on ram rom st m umb shell c p if i be use i probably use something that look like on ram rom st m umb shell c p however if i use a floppy-controller-based tape drive or if i plan to record high-quality sound from a sound card i would still need some way of change the adaptec bu time the first two version of take care of thi but thi last version do local variable fill-column eval auto-fill-mode nil end
