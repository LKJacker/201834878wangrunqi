from keith keith allan schneider subject re political atheist kcochran keith justified and ancient cochran write i think that you be confuse the word objective and inherent and objective system be simply one in which an outside observer who give the postulate of the system could perfectly judge any situation or action a consistent with the system right or not wrong you seem to be object because the goal of the system be not inherent that be you seem to want to define an objective system a one in which the postulate themself could be determine by some outside observer i do think that thi be a good definition of an objective system then you need to learn english really gravity be an objective system anybody can learn what it be and perform experiment they will get the same result a every other person who ha perform those experiment no gravity be an inherent system you do need any exces information other than observation to determine anything it be possible to objectively determine someone guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system i agree that morality be not necessarily inherent unles you state that everything we do ha an evolutionary basi but thi do not mean that it can not be objective in theory thi natural morality be not an objective system a evidence by ymy comment about lion and mine perhap it can be objective but not inherent anyway a i note before the practice relate to mat ritual etc among the animal be likely the only one to be consider immoral under the previou definition of the natural law therefore some revision be in order since the clas of activity surround mat seem to pose some general problem and in fact the only way that the postulate could be determine by an outsider would be if there be some sort of higher truth like some sort of god or something but i do not think that a god be necessary for an objective system while it seem that you do what be you try to say here it see that you be object to the notion of an objective system because perhap you think that it would imply inherence which would necessitate some sort of grand design no i have classify behavior of most animal a in line with a moral system it be certainly possible for animal to commit act which be outside of their rule of ethic but they do seem to do so very often perhap they be not intelligent enough to be immoral and perhap it because you have yet to define a moral system i think i have it be a code of ethic which basically define undesired behavior etc an immoral behavior could be unwanted unproductive or destructive etc depend on the goal of the system that be immoral to what end keith
