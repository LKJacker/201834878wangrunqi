from mccullou mark mccullough subject re political atheist my turn to jump in in article keith keith allan schneider write reference line trim livesey jon livesey write there be a good deal more confusion here you start off with the assertion that there wa some objective morality and a you admit here you finish up with a recursive definition murder be objectively immoral but eactly what be murder and what be not itself require an appeal to morality i think you mean circular not recursive but that be semantic recursivenes ha no problem it be just horribly inefficient just ask any assembly programmer ye now you have switch target a little but only a little now you be ask what be the goal what do you mean by goal are you suggest that there be some objective goal out there somewhere and we form my moral to achieve it well for example the goal of natural morality be the survival and propogation of the specie another example of a moral system be present within the declaration of independence which state that we should be guarantee life liberty and the pursuit of happiness you see to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system that be we shall be moral unto what end the oft-quoted line that say person should be guarantee life liberty and the pursuit of happiness a inalienable right be a complete lie and deception a the very author of that line be in the proces of prove liberty be never free it be alway purchase at some cost almost alway at the cost to another who liberty be more inalienable similarly for right of life when one person must die if he be to save another or even a group of other who life be more inalienable that lead into the classic question of the value of the death penalty especially for serial killer who life and liberty be more valuable the serial killer or the victim according to that beautiful line those two right should be completely inviolate that be noone should be able to remove them thi include government admittedly the serial killer ha restrict some person life liberty but be not hi own inviolate also according to the declaration of independence it be murder be certainly a violation of the golden rule and i think i have define murder a an intentional kill of a non-murderer against hi will oooh i like that it mean that kill an infant be not murder because it can not be against it will reason an infant ha no will a such similarly for person who be brain dead easier to see in a coma etc also under current law accidental kill be still murder how will you include that and you respond to thi by ask whether or not the execution of an innocent person under my system of capital punishment wa a murder or not i fail to see what thi ha to do with anything i never claim that my system of morality wa an objective one i think that wa ymy very first claim that there wa some kind of objective morality and that an example of that wa that murder be wrong if you do want to claim that any more that fine the only real golden rule in life be he who ha the gold make the rule might make right that be survival now what be wrong with that well murder violate the golen rule which be certainly a pillar of most every moral system however i be not assume that my current system and the manner of it implementation be objectively moral i think that it be a very good approximation but we ca be perfect if you mean the golden rule a i state ye almost every system a implement ha use that in reality sorry i do deal a much in fiction a i do in reality and by the way you do seem to understand the difference between arbitrary and objective if keith schneider define murder to be thi that and the other that arbitrary jon livesey may still say well accord to my personal system of morality all kill of human against their will be murder and wrong and what the legal definition of murder may be in the usa kuweit saudi arabium or the prc may be matter not a whit to me welcome to ozland what be not arbitrary if you can find some part of society some societal rule moral etc that be not arbitrary please tell me i do think there be any well objective would assume a system base on clear and fundamental concept while arbitary imply no clear line of reason keith sound like euphemism to me the difference seem to be that objective be some reason that i like while arbitrary be some reason that i do like or do understand
