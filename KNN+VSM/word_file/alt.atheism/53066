from kempmp petrus pihko subject re is morality constant wa re biblical rape bill conner bil write there be a couple of thing about ymy post and other in thi thread that be a little confuse an atheist be one for whom all thing can be understand a process of nature exclusively thi definition do not include all atheist see the faq however i for one do think there be no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanation it make a big difference to claim that all thing can be understand a natural process and to claim that my observation do not require u to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter human be not omnipotent and neither be science however science ha one advantage theology do it be self correct with nature a it judge it be delightful to see how scientific inquiry be reveal a self consistent simple picture of my universe science be no longer a bunch of separate branch it be one from particle physic to psychology and no aspect of my life or my universe be safe from it stern and stony eye not even my consciousnes there be no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there be no purpose or direction for any event beyond those require by physic chemistry biology etc everything be random nothing be determnined actually determinism v indeterminism be a philosophical question and science can not say whether the whole thing be actually somehow superdeterministic or not i think the question do not have any mean a far a individual human be go if their apparent free will be an illusion it do not appear to be so from their perspective bill can you say for sure whether you have a free will or not thi would also have to include human intelligence of course and all it product there be nothing require that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence it just a happy accident maybe who be we to tell it seem intelligence be useful when during the history of earth ha one specie be able to control one third of the whole biosphere thi can still be a result of numerou happy accident my genetic machinery blindly replicate and preserve even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the system that can start replicate will survive those which do do make it recommended read for an atheist no event can be prefer to another or be say to have more or le value than another in any naturalistic sense and no think about an event can have value from whose perspective i value event and thing subjectively from my perspective nature do not have value because it do not have a perspective value arise from awarenes if i have a subjective perspective it be easy to assume that other person also do and if i think about what it would it be like in their position i will eventually discover the golden rule morality be not necessarily a gift from heaven in fact it may be a product of evolution perhap we be aware of ourself because a sense of identity be helpful allow u to play the role of other and make u respect other who seem to have identity too bill have you ever read aristotle try hi ethica nikomakhea sp for starter how then can an atheist judge value what be the basi for criticize the value ennumerated in the bible or the purpose impute to god on what grind can the the behavior of the reliogiou be condemn it seem that in judge the value that motivate other to action you have to have some standard against which conduct be measure but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish ymy value lewi tell u that thi argument wa the main reason why he abandon hi atheism and become christian the argument be severely flaw some value such a the golden rule can have a rational basi some other like the basic idea of want to live ha probably it root in the way my brain be wire lewi ignore the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favmy altruistic behavimy and morality a well indeed a human evolve better and better in build and use tool they also become better at kill each other it be a logical necessity that evolution could only favmy those who know how to use tool but not against one own person the bible reveal quite nicely that the morality of the early jew wa not beyond thi a simple set of rule to hold the person together under one god their god do not care much about person of other nation at the time of the nt thing be quite different the jew be under rule of an empire and could no longer simply ignore the gentile a new situation require a new morality and along with it a new religion wa bear a mutation in a meme pool since every event be entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone do religiou or otherwise there can be no mean or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behavimy be to admit that the objection be entirely subjective and that he she just do like it that it any value judgement must be preface by the disclaimer that it be nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carry no weight in any absolute sense it look like you have bother to read philosophy whenever there be an observer there be a subjective point of view which may value it existence and happiness even if that be just a result of some physical event and other happiness too if the observer come to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that be without any observer or subject moral judgment lose their mean it be not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view thi include god too their value be only their personal judgment not absolute truth since such truth do not exist the fact that most person do not deliberately want to hurt other be a manifestation of the way we have fight for my existence by become social be who can think and value other existence morality be not property of human alone chimp dolphin and many other specie show great care for each other dolphin have sometime save human from drown a good deed indeed that you do like what god tell person to do say nothing about god or god command it say only that there wa an electrical event in ymy nervou system that create an emotional state that ymy mind couple with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction that ymy objection seem well found be due to the way you be condition there be no truth content the whole of ymy intellectual landscape be an illusion a virtual reality the last statement do not logically follow in fact there be every reason to believe my think can model reality very well and my sense can convey reliable information solipsism be still a logical possibility but not a very likely one you be continuously mix two different view the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view which do not exist any observer or thinker any personal be ha it own point of view it do not matter whether thi point of view be a result of some physical event or not it do not cease to be subjective from a non-observer non-point of view value do not exist neither do pain or pleasure or beauty or love such thing be inherently subjective once again if god want wife to submit to their husband or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or want to punish u if we do i disagree with hi moral i do not think my moral come from any supreme be to remove my moral mean the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single think if god give u morality to judge but i disagree with him it be not my fault he be free to replace my moral i can not see what be the point of give someone a moral system which disagree with one own and then to get mad at thi god must be schizophrenic all of thi be so you have exclude yourself from any discussion of value right wrong goood evil etc and can not participate ymy opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever neither can the opinion of any god for that matter i can not understand why a subjective opinion of a thing make of matter be in any way le credible than an opinion of a thing make of something else bill take note absolute value must be independent of any be include god if god ha a subjective viewpoint it be hi own point of view and hi moral be hi own petrus petrus pihko kem-pmp mathematics be the truth pihatie c physic be the rule of oulu kempmp the game finland chemistry be the game
