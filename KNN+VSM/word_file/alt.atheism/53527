from leonard newnham subject re islam and scientific prediction wa umar khan khan write i strongly suggest that you look up a book call the bible the quran and science by maurice baucaille a french surgeon it be not comprehensive he wa unable to find a wealth of scientific statement in the holy but what he do find make sense with modern understand so he investigate the tradition the hadith to see what they have to say about science they be fill with science problem after all they be contemporary narrative from a time which have by pmy standard a primitive world view hi conclusion wa that while he wa impress that what little the holy have to say about science wa accurate he wa far more impress that the holy do not contain the same rampant error evidence in the tradition how would a man of century arabium have know what not to include in the holy assume he have author it thi book be worth a read to get a sensible view of thi issue the book be in two section section contain a fairly reasonable analysi of the bible show many inconsistency between the bible and modern science well we all know that no surprise section analysis the koran version of the old testament story and seem on the face of it to present a good case show the koran be consistent with modern science however it wa plain to me that thi consistency wa only possible by the vague phraseology of the koran take the flood for example the bible be full of detail forty day and forty night pair of every animal etc we all know thi be nonsense the koran description of the same event be so obscure a to make possible an interpretation such a a big river flood for a few day and cause much damage ye no contradiction but also not much fact the koran might be consistent with modern science but be consistent due to it vaguenes compare with other book of that time do not seem much of an achievement the book conclude by say something like the koran must have have divine inspiration because at the time it wa write there be a lot of to u now ridiculou idea about the universe and none of them can be find in the koran arguing for the greatnes of a book by talk about what it do not contain seem absurd in the extreme the above be of course from memory so i may have miss some point leonard e-mail
