from mathew mathew subject faq introduction to atheism archive-name alt-atheism-archive-name introduction last-modified april version begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew mathew thi article attempt to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst i have try to be a neutral a possible regard contentiou issue you should alway remember that thi document represent only one viewpoint i would encourage you to read widely and draw ymy own conclusion some relevant book be list in a companion article to provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have present thi article a an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all the question ask by the imaginary theist be question which have be crop up repeatedly on since the newsgroup wa create some other frequently ask question be answer in a companion article please note that thi article be arguably slant toward answer question pose from a christian viewpoint thi be because the faq file reflect question which have actually be ask and it be predominantly christian who proselytize on so when i talk of religion i be talk primarily about religion such a christianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine be much of the discussion will apply to other religion but some of it may not what be atheism atheism be characterize by an absence of belief in the existence of god some atheist go further and believe that god do not exist the former be often refer to a the weak atheist position and the latter a strong atheism it be important to note the difference between these two position weak atheism be simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strong atheism be a positive belief that god do not exist please do not fall into the trap of assume that all atheist be strong atheist some atheist believe in the non-existence of all god other limit their atheism to specific god such a the christian god rather than make flat-out denial but be disbelieve in god the same thing a believe he do exist definitely not disbelief in a proposition mean that one do not believe it to be true not believe that something be true be not equivalent to believe that it be false one may simply have no idea whether it be true or not which bring u to agnosticism what be agnosticism then the term wa coin by professor huxley at a meet of the metaphysical society in he define an agnostic a someone who disclaim strong atheism and believe that the ultimate origin of thing must be some cause unknown and unknowable thu an agnostic be someone who believe that we do not and can not know for sure whether god exist word be slippery thing and language be inexact beware of assume that you can work out someone philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she call herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many person use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when refer to strong atheism beware also that because the word atheist ha so many shade of mean it be very difficult to generalize about atheist about all you can say for sure be that atheist do believe in god for example it certainly be the case that all atheist believe that science be the best way to find out about the universe so what be the philosophical justification or basi for atheism there be many philosophical justification for atheism to find out why a particular person choose to be an atheist it best to ask her many atheist feel that the idea of god a present by the major religion be essentially self-contradictory and that it be logically impossible that such a god could exist other be atheist through scepticism because they see no evidence that god exist but be it impossible to prove the non-existence of something there be many counter-example to such a statement for example it be quite simple to prove that there do not exist a prime number larger than all other prime number of course thi deal with well-defined object obey well-defined rule whether god or universe be similarly well-defined be a matter for debate however assume for the moment that the existence of a god be not provably impossible there be still subtle reason for assume the non-existence of god if we assume that something do not exist it be alway possible to show that thi assumption be invalid by find a single counter-example if on the other hand we assume that something do exist and if the thing in question be not provably impossible show that the assumption be invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible place where such a thing might be find to show that it be there such an exhaustive search be often impractical or impossible there be no such problem with largest prime because we can prove that they do exist therefore it be generally accept that we must assume thing do not exist unles we have evidence that they do even theist follow thi rule most of the time they do believe in unicorn even though they ca conclusively prove that no unicorn exist anywhere to assume that god exist be to make an assumption which probably can not be test we can not make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he do exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assume by default that god do not exist since that be an assumption we can test those who profes strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god exist instead they generally restrict their claim so a to cover variety of god describe by follower of variou religion so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exist it may be possible to prove that say a god a describe by a particular religiou book do not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god describe by any present-day religion exist in practice believe that no god describe by any religion exist be very close to believe that no god exist however it be sufficiently different that counter-argument base on the impossibility of disprove every kind of god be not really applicable but what if god be essentially non-detectable if god interact with my universe in any way the effect of hi interaction must be measurable hence hi interaction with my universe must be detectable if god be essentially non-detectable it must therefore be the case that he do not interact with my universe in any way many atheist would argue that if god do not interact with my universe at all it be of no importance whether he exist or not if the bible be to be believe god wa easily detectable by the israelite surely he should still be detectable today note that i be not demand that god interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive some effect cause by hi presence though otherwise how can i distinguish him from all the other thing that do exist ok you may think there a philosophical justification for atheism but be it still a religiou belief one of the most common pastime in philosophical discussion be the redefinition game the cynical view of thi game be a follow person a begin by make a contentiou statement when person b point out that it ca be true person a gradually re-define the word he use in the statement until he arrife at something person b be prepare to accept he then record the statement along with the fact that person b ha agree to it and continue eventually a use the statement a an agree fact but use hi original definition of all the word in it rather than the obscure redefinition originally need to get b to agree to it rather than be see to be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play along the point of thi digression be that the answer to the question is atheism a religiou belief depend crucially upon what be mean by religiou religion be generally characterize by belief in a superhuman control power especially in some sort of god and by faith and worship it worth point out in pass that some variety of buddhism be not religion accord to such a definition atheism be certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor be it categorize by worship in any meaningful sense widening the definition of religiou to encompas atheism tend to result in many other aspect of human behavimy suddenly become class a religiou a well such a science politic and watch tv ok so it not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science be still just an act of faith like religion be firstly it not entirely clear that sceptical atheism be something one actually believe in secondly it be necessary to adopt a number of core belief or assumption to make some sort of sense out of the sensory datum we experience most atheist try to adopt a few core belief a possible and even those be subject to question if experience throw them into doubt science ha a number of core assumption for example it be generally assume that the law of physic be the same for all observer these be the sort of core assumption atheist make if such basic idea be call act of faith then almost everything we know must be say to be base on act of faith and the term losis it mean faith be more often use to refer to complete certain belief in something according to such a definition atheism and science be certainly not act of faith of course individual atheist or scientist can be a dogmatic a religiou follower when claim that something be certain thi be not a general tendency however there be many atheist who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exist faith be also use to refer to belief without support evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly do fit that definition a sceptical atheism ha no belief strong atheism be closer but still do really match a even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental datum or the lack of it when assert that god do not exist if atheism be not religiou surely it anti-religiou it be an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone a either for or against friend or enemy the truth be not so clear-cut atheism be the position that run logically counter to theism in that sense it can be say to be anti-religion however when religiou believer speak of atheist be anti-religiou they usually mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathy or hatred toward theist thi categorization of atheist a hostile toward religion be quite unfair atheist attitude toward theist in fact cover a broad spectrum most atheist take a live and let live attitude unles question they will not usually mention their atheism except perhap to close friend of course thi may be in part because atheism be not socially acceptable in many country a few atheist be quite anti-religiou and may even try to convert other when possible historically such anti-religiou atheist have make little impact on society outside the eastern bloc country to digres slightly the soviet union wa originally dedicate to separation of church and state just like the usa soviet citizen be legally free to worship a they wish the institution of state atheism come about when stalin take control of the soviet union and try to destroy the church in order to gain complete power over the population some atheist be quite vocal about their belief but only where they see religion encroach on matter which be not it busines for example the government of the usa such individual be usually concern that church and state should remain separate but if you do allow religion to have a say in the run of the state surely that the same a state atheism the principle of the separation of church and state be that the state shall not legislate concern matter of religiou belief in particular it mean not only that the state can not promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it can not promote any belief which be religiou in nature religion can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matter for example religiou believer have historically be responsible for encourage many political reform even today many organization campaign for an increase in spend on foreign aid be found a religiou campaign so long a they campaign concern secular matter and so long a they do not discriminate on religiou grind most atheist be quite happy to see them have their say what about prayer in school if there no god why do you care if person pray because person who do pray be voter and lawmaker and tend to do thing that those who do pray ca just ignore also christian prayer in school be intimidate to non-christian even if they be tell that they need not join in the diversity of religiou and non-religiou belief mean that it be impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event also non-prayer tend to have friend and family who pray it be reasonable to care about friend and family waste their time even without other motive you mention christian who campaign for increase foreign aid what about atheist why be there any atheist charity or hospital do atheist object to the religiou charity there be many charity without religiou purpose that atheist can contribute to some atheist contribute to religiou charity a well for the sake of the practical good they do some atheist even do voluntary work for charity found on a theistic basi most atheist seem to feel that atheism be worth shout about in connection with charity to them atheism be just a simple obviou everyday matter and so be charity many feel that it somewhat cheap not to say self-righteou to use simple charity a an excuse to plug a particular set of religiou belief to weak atheist build a hospital to say i do not believe in god be a rather strange idea it rather like hold a party to say today be not my birthday why the fus atheism be rarely evangelical you say atheism be anti-religiou but be it perhap a backlash against one upbringing a way of rebel perhap it be for some but many person have parent who do not attempt to force any religiou or atheist idea upon them and many of those person choose to call themself atheist it also doubtles the case that some religiou person choose religion a a backlash against an atheist upbringing a a way of be different on the other hand many person choose religion a a way of conform to the expectation of other on the whole we ca conclude much about whether atheism or religion be backlash or conformism although in general person have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently how do atheist differ from religiou person they do believe in god that all there be to it atheist may listen to heavy metal backward even or they may prefer a verdi requiem even if they know the word they may wear hawaiian shirt they may dres all in black they may even wear orange robe many buddhist lack a belief in any sort of god some atheist even carry a copy of the bible around for argue against of course whoever you be the chance be you have meet several atheist without realise it atheist be usually unexceptional in behavimy and appearance unexceptional but be atheist le moral than religiou person that depend if you define morality a obedience to god then of course atheist be le moral a they do obey any god but usually when one talk of morality one talk of what be acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behavimy within society human be social animal and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other thi be a good enough reason to discourage most atheist from anti-social or immoral behavimy purely for the purpose of self-preservation many atheist behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other human so why do they care what happen to other they do know they simply be that way naturally there be some person who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their action however there be equally many person who behave immorally and then try to use religiou belief to justify their action for example here be a trustworthy say that deserve full acceptance jesu christ come into the world to save sinner but for that very reason i wa show mercy so that in me jesu christ might display hi unlimited patience a an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever the above quote be from a statement make to the court on february by jeffrey dahmer the notoriou cannibal serial killer of milwaukee wisconsin it seem that for every atheist mass-murderer there be a religiou mass-murderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conduct by the roper organization find that behavior deteriorate after bear again experience while only of respondent say they have drive intoxicate before be bear again have do so after conversion similarly have use illegal drug before conversion after two percent admit to engage in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september p so it seem that at best religion do not have a monopoly on moral behavimy is there such a thing a atheist morality if you mean is there such a thing a morality for atheist then the answer be ye a explain above many atheist have idea about morality which be at least a strong a those hold by religiou person if you mean do atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer be no atheism by itself do not imply anything much about how a person will behave most atheist follow many of the same moral rule a theist but for different reason atheist view morality a something create by human accord to the way human feel the world to work rather than see it a a set of rule decree by a supernatural be then be atheist just theist who be deny god a study by the freedom from religion foundation find that over of the atheist who respond become atheist because religion do not work for them they have find that religiou belief be fundamentally incompatible with what they observe around them atheist be not unbeliever through ignorance or denial they be unbeliever through choice the vast majority of them have spend time study one or more religion sometime in very great depth they have make a careful and consider decision to reject religiou belief thi decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual personality for a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism be often the only one that make sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make but do atheist want to believe in god atheist live their life a though there be nobody watch over them many of them have no desire to be watch over no matter how good-natured the big brother figure might be some atheist would like to be able to believe in god but so what should one believe thing merely because one want them to be true the risk of such an approach should be obviou atheist often decide that want to believe something be not enough there must be evidence for the belief but of course atheist see no evidence for the existence of god they be unwilling in their soul to see many if not most atheist be previously religiou a ha be explain above the vast majority have seriously consider the possibility that god exist many atheist have spend time in prayer try to reach god of course it be true that some atheist lack an open mind but assume that all atheist be bias and insincere be offensive and closed-minded comment such a of course god be there you just be look properly be likely to be view a patronize certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheist it be vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they be be sincere if they say that they have search for god if you be not will to believe that they be basically tell the truth debate be futile is the whole of life completely pointles to an atheist many atheist live a purposeful life they decide what they think gife mean to life and they pursue those goal they try to make their life count not by wish for eternal life but by have an influence on other person who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate hi life to political reform in the hope of leave hi mark on history it be a natural human tendency to look for mean or purpose in random event however it be by no mean obviou that life be the sort of thing that ha a mean to put it another way not everything which look like a question be actually a sensible thing to ask some atheist believe that ask what be the mean of life be a silly a ask what be the mean of a cup of coffee they believe that life ha no purpose or mean it just be so how do atheist find comfort in time of danger there be many way of obtain comfort from family friend or even pet or on a le spiritual level from food or drink or tv that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what should individual believe in thing because they be comfort or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be in the end it a decision for the individual concern most atheist be unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it make them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and consider that if search for truth sometime make them feel unhappy that just hard luck do atheist worry that they might suddenly be show to be wrong the short answer be no do you many atheist have be atheist for year they have encounter many argument and much suppose evidence for the existence of god but they have find all of it to be invalid or inconclusive thousand of year of religiou belief have result in any good proof of the existence of god atheist therefore tend to feel that they be unlikely to be prove wrong in the immediate future and they stop worry about it so why should theist question their belief do the same argument apply no because the belief be question be not similar weak atheism be the sceptical default position to take it assert nothing strong atheism be a negative belief theism be a very strong positive belief atheist sometime also argue that theist should question their belief because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believer but to everyone else what sort of harm religion represent a huge financial and work burden on mankind it not just a matter of religiou believer waste their money on church build think of all the time and effort spend build church pray and so on imagine how that effort could be better spend many theist believe in miracle heal there have be plenty of instance of ill person be heal by a priest cease to take the medicine prescribe to them by doctor and die a a result some theist have die because they have refuse blood transfusion on religiou grind it be arguable that the catholic church opposition to birth control and condom in particular be increase the problem of overpopulation in many third-world country and contribute to the spread of aid world-wide religiou believer have be know to murder their child rather than allow their child to become atheist or marry someone of a different religion those be real believer they just claim to be believer a some sort of excuse what make a real believer there be so many one true religion it hard to tell look at christianity there be many compete group all convince that they be the only true christian sometime they even fight and kill each other how be an atheist suppose to decide who a real christian and who be when even the major christian church like the catholic church and the church of england ca decide amongst themself in the end most atheist take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who call himself a christian and use christian belief or dogma to justify hi action should be consider a christian maybe some of those christian be just pervert christian teach for their own end but surely if the bible can be so readily use to support un-christian act it ca be much of a moral code if the bible be the word of god why could he have make it le easy to misinterpret and how do you know that ymy belief be a perversion of what ymy god intend if there be no single unambiguou interpretation of the bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on ymy say-so sorry but if someone claim that he believe in jesu and that he murder other because jesu and the bible tell him to do so we must call him a christian obviously those extreme sort of belief should be question but since nobody ha ever prove that god do not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religiou belief share by all faith be nonsense that do not hold because a wa point out at the start of thi dialogue positive assertion concern the existence of entity be inherently much harder to disprove than negative one nobody ha ever prove that unicorn do exist but that do make it unlikely that they be myth it be therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it be to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheist would argue that assert nothing be better still well if atheism so great why be there so many theist unfortunately the popularity of a belief ha little to do with how correct it be or whether it work consider how many person believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo-science many atheist feel that it be simply a human weaknes to want to believe in god certainly in many primitive human society religion allow the person to deal with phenomenon that they do not adequately understand of course there more to religion than that in the industrialize world we find person believe in religiou explanation of phenomenon even when there be perfectly adequate natural explanation religion may have start a a mean of attempt to explain the world but nowaday it serve other purpose a well but so many culture have develop religion surely that must say something not really most religion be only superficially similar for example it worth remember that religion such a buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian sense of course most religion be quick to denounce compete religion so it rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another what about all the famou scientist and philosopher who have conclude that god exist for every scientist or philosopher who believe in a god there be one who do not beside a ha already be point out the truth of a belief be not determine by how many person believe it also it be important to realize that atheist do not view famou scientist or philosopher in the same way that theist view their religiou leader a famou scientist be only human she may be an expert in some field but when she talk about other matter her word carry no special weight many respect scientist have make themself look foolish by speak on subject which lie outside their field of expertise so be you really say that widespread belief in religion indicate nothing not entirely it certainly indicate that the religion in question ha property which have help it so spread so far the theory of memetic talk of meme set of idea which can propagate themself between human mind by analogy with gene some atheist view religion a set of particularly successful parasitic meme which spread by encourage their host to convert other some meme avoid destruction by discourage believer from question doctrine or by use peer pressure to keep one-time believer from admit that they be mistake some religiou meme even encourage their host to destroy host control by other meme of course in the memetic view there be no particular virtue associate with successful propagation of a meme religion be not a good thing because of the number of person who believe it any more than a disease be a good thing because of the number of person who have catch it even if religion be not entirely true at least it put acros important message what be the fundamental message of atheism there be many important idea atheist promote the follow be just a few of them do be surprise to see idea which be also present in some religion there be more to moral behavimy than mindlessly follow rule be especially sceptical of positive claim if you want ymy life to have some sort of mean it up to you to find it search for what be true even if it make you uncomfortable make the most of ymy life a it probably the only one you have it no good rely on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because something popular do mean it good if you must assume something assume something it easy to test do believe thing just because you want them to be true and finally and most importantly all belief should be open to question thank for take the time to read thi article mathew begin pgp signature version end pgp signature for
