from mathew mathew subject re death penalty gulf war long jbrown write i do regret the fact that sometime military decision have to be make which affect the life of innocent person but i do regret the circumstance which make those decision necessary and i regret the suffer cause by those decision i afraid i go to have to kill you do worry though a a loving christian i guarantee that i will regret the fact that i have to kill you although i wo regret the actual kill if we have intervene allow hussein to keep kuwait then it would have be appeasement right but do you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action or be you just set up a strawman i not set up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative wa to allow hussein to keep kuwait false dichotomy diplomatic alternative include sanction be ineffective that because they be even attempt but what about those who do support hitler dream of conquest it not a if they democratically vote for all hi policy the nsdap get in the election of and that wa the last chance the german person get to vote on the matter they suffer along with the rest why do thi bother you so much you want to know why it bother me that thousand of innocent person be maim or kill by bomb at the end of when it wa far from clear that such bomb wa necessary the world be full of evil and circumstance be not perfect many innocent suffer due to the wrongful action of other it it regretable but that the-way-it-i and why-is-it-that-way who set thing up to be that way thi wa happen before the gulf war why do we send in the bomber to east timor why be we send in the bomber now probably because we not the savior of the world we ca polouse each and every country that decide to self-destruct or invade another no just the one that have oil or the one that look like they might make a succes of communism nor be we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other place i do see that get un force to east timor be any harder than get them to iraq tibetan person be round up torture and execute amnesty international recently report that torture be still widespread in china why be we stop them in fact why be we actively suck up to them by trade freely with them tell me how we could stop them and i support it i for one do not agree with the present u policy of suck up to them a you put it i agree that it be deplorable fine write to ymy congressman and to president clinton china statu a most favoured nation come up for renewal in june point out that the u should be offer favourable trade term to such a despicable regime i doubt anything will happen clinton keener on trade sanction against europe unbelievable comment about the rodney king case delete the medium be not totally monolithic even though there be a prevail liberal bia program such a the macneil-lehrer news hmy try to give a balance and fair report of the news there be even conservative source out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush any idea how many kill file you just end up in i an atheist be argue against kill innocent person you a suppose christian be argue that it ok to kill innocent person so long a you get some guilty one a well hardly i do say that it a good thing tm to kill innocent person if the end be just unfortunately we do live in a perfect world and there be no perfect solution if one be go to resist tyranny then innocent person on both side be go to suffer and die i do say it be ok it be unfortunate but sometime necessary the end justify the mean eh you have criticise moral relativism in the past be now argue that i be in no position to judge the morality of ally action at the end of the war you certainly be not in such a position if you be a moral relativist the same tire old misunderstand moral relativism mean that there be no objective standard of morality it do mean you ca judge other person moral christ on a bike how many time have we try to hammer that into ymy head where ymy christian love where ymy absolute morality oh how quick you be to discard them when it suit you a ivan stang would say jesu would puke one day i will stand before jesu and give account of every word and action even thi discourse in thi forum i understand the full ramification of that and i be prepare to do so i do believe that you can make the same claim obviously not a i be an atheist i do think you get on with jesu though he wa a long-haired lunatic peace-nik wa he not and btw the reason i bring up the blanket-bombing in germany wa because you be bemoan the iraqi civilian casualty a be so deplorable yet blanket bomb wa institute because bomb wa accurate enough to hit target in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bomb wa the norm so the point wa why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualty that result in spite of precision bomb when so many more civilian proportionately and quantitatively die under the blanket bomb in right unfortunately for you it turn out that my opinion on the matter be entirely consistent in that i condemn the bomb of dresden too i think you be a bite glib with ymy explanation of the blanket bomb policy too you make it sound a though we be aim for military target and could only get them by destroy civilian build next door a i understand it that be not the case we aim deliberately at civilian target in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the german person civilian suffer but le civilian suffer in thi war than any other iany other in history oh come on with war like the falkland fresh in person mind that sort of propaganda be go to fool anyone the story of hundred of thousand of iraqi civilian dead be just plain bunk ye bunk the u lose serviceman in over fmy year and the majority of them be directly involve in fight ye and what about the million of casualty the russian suffer it hardly surprise the u do lose many man in give that you turn up late mathew
