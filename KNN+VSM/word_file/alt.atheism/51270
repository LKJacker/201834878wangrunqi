from mangoe charley wingate subject re gospel dating benedikt rosenau write the argument go a follow q-oid quote appear in john but not in the almost codify way they be in matthew or luke however they be consider to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q a such and not an entirely different source assuming you be present it accurately i do see how thi argument really lead to any firm conclusion the material in john i not sure exactly what be refer to here but i take for grant the similarity to the q material is different hence one could have almost any relationship between the two right up to john get it straight from jesu mouth we be talk date of text here not the age of the author the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke do not consider their respective age it say matthew ha read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark the version of the usual theory i have hear ha matthew and luke independently rely on mark and q one would think that if luke rely on matthew we would have the grate inconsistency in the geneology for one thing a it be assume that john know the content of luke text the evidence for that be not overwhelm admittedly thi be the part that be particularly new to me if it be possible that you could point me to a reference i be grateful unfortunately i have get the info at hand it wa i think in the late or early and it wa possibly a old a ce when they be from about why do they shed doubt on the order on put john after the rest of the three because it close up the gap between suppose write and the exist copy quit a bite the further away from the original the more copy can be write and therefore survival become more probable and i do think a one step remove source be that bad if luke and mark and matthew learn their story directly from diciple then i really can not believe in the sort of big transformation from jesu to gospel that some person posit in news report one generally get no better information than thi and if john is a diciple then there nothing more to be say that john wa a disciple be not generally accept the style and language together with the theology be usually use a counterargument i not really impress with the theology argument but i really point thi out a an if and a i point out earlier one can not make these argument about i peter i see no reason not to accept it a an authentic letter one step and one generation remove be bad even in my time compare that to report of similar event in my century in almost illiterate society the best analogy would be reporter talk to the participant which be not so bad in other word one do not know what the original of mark do look like and argument base on mark be pretty weak but the statement of divinity be not in that section and in any case it agree that the most important epistle predate mark c wingate the peace of god it be no peace but strife close in the sod mangoe yet brother pray for but one thing tove mangoe the peace of god
