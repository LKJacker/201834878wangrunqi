from dfuller dave fuller subject re death penalty wa re political atheist the death penalty wa conceive a a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigan that have be add automatic appeal lengthy court battle etc have relegate that purpose to a very small part of what it should be hence the question be do we instate the death penalty a it wa mean to be and see if that deter crime or do we get rid of it entirely i doubt the death penalty wa suppose to be a deterrent to crime if so why do every crime carry a death penalty that would be effictive would it the death penalty be a punishment much like a fine for speed be a punishment anyway somebody with murder on the mind do much care about the consequence i think another problem be that person dont think they will get catch if i want to kill another person i would care what the penalty wa if i do think i would get catch if it wa to be strictly a deterrent it should have be more along the line of torture dave fuller dfuller
