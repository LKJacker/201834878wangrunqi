from benedikt rosenau subject re an anecdote about islam in article jaeger gregg jaeger write in case of prostitution both the man and the prostitute would be punish in public quite severely deletion no gregg you can not say a be lenient and a punish severely in public unles of course it be one of the exception imply by almost all matter that depend on the statistic and who be punish in public if some power for example nothing islamic about it allow man to rape woman five time before blow the rapist head off in public then i call that leniency would you you have give that example it be not lenient end of argument and chop off the hand or head of person be not lenient either it rather appear that you be internalize the claim about the legal system without check if they suit the description and wa the argument that it take five man to rape a woman accord to islamic law while i do approve of it i think both the prostitute and the customer have the right to do what they do in other word punish them be a violation of their right and to punish them severely in public be just another pointer to the hysterium connect with sexuality in so many religion believe what you like no i even believe what i do like can you give better answer than that have you get any evidence for ymy probably opposite claim in thi case i do see why i should accept the complex ride view of an oriental goatherd ah ye i forget that the west be historically so much without sexual neurosi oriental goatherd really intellectual a fact if memory serve and most will see the connection between the primitive machism in the orient and in islam if person agree on have sex it be fine and i would assume that a god would have a clue of what the detrimental effect of supressing it be huh ever hear of aid of course you probably go on to say that god must be evil because he allow the disease to exist bla bla a usually you mi the point aid be neither spread only through sex nor necessarily spread by have sex futher the point be a very important point the urge for sex be stronger than the fear of aid it be even stronger than the religiou attempt to channel or to forbid sex the consequence of suppress sex be worse than the consequence of aid please note that the idea that everybody would end up with aid when sex be not control be completely counterfactual and since you have bring up the point be ymy god evil or not benedikt
