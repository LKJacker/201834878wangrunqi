from tgk todd kelley subject re faith and dogma marshall kevin marshall hsq write i do necessarily disagree with ymy assertion but i disagree with ymy reason faith bad dogma bad religion faith dogma religion bad bad religion bad unfortunately you never state why faith and dogma be dangerou faith and dogma be dangerou because they cause person to act on faith alone which by it nature be without justification that be what i mean by the word faith belief without justification or belief with arbitrary justification or with emotional irrational justification for example when someone say that god exist that they do know why they believe god exist they can just feel it that faith dogma be bad because it preclude positive change in belief base on new information or increase mental faculty so christian be totally irrational irrational with respect to their religion only what be you say one belief in a christian god do not make one totally irrational i think i know what you be get at but i rather hear you expand on the subject faith and dogma be irrational the faith and dogma part of any religion be responsible for the irrationality of the individual i claim that faith and dogma be the quintessential part of any religion if that make the much overuse in thi context buddism a philosophy rather than a religion i can live with that science be not a religion because there be no faith nor dogma a philosopher can not be a christian because a philosopher can change hi mind wherea a christian can not due to the nature of faith and dogma present in any religion again thi statement be too general a christian be perfectly capable of be a philosopher and absolutely capable of change mind faith in god be a belief and all belief may change would you assert that atheist would make poor philosopher because they be predispose to not believe in a god which of course may show unfair bia when study say religion have you notice that philosopher tend to be atheist if a philosopher be not an atheist tend to be call a theologian a christian tend to consider christianity sacred christianity be a special set of belief sanction by god himself and therefore to conceive of change those belief be to question the existence of that being who make no mistake faith come into play dogma come into play the lord work in mysteriou way be an example of faith be use to reconcile evidence that the belief be flaw sure interpretation of what god say be change to satisfy the need of society but when god say something that it it wa say and that that since god say it it be unflawed even if the interpretation be flaw science a would be practice by atheist in contrast ha a built in defence against faith and dogma a scientist hold sacred the idea that belief should change to suit whatever be the best information available at the time and and and a scientist understand that any current belief be deficient in some way the goal be to keep improve the belief the goal be to keep change the belief to reflect the best information currently available that the only rational thing to do that good philosophy can you see the difference science view belief a be flaw and new information can be obtain to improve them how many scientist would claim to have complete and perfect understand of everything none it would put them out of a job religion view it belief a be perfect and the interpretation of those belief must be change a new information be acquire which conflict with them please explain how just because think kill person and please state more in ymy answer than waco it easier for someone to kill a person when do require a good rational justification of the kill i do consider he jewish or he wa bear of jewish parent or thi document say he jewish to be good rational justification by the way i wa aware ma suicide wa a problem waco and jonestown be isolate incident mas suicide be far from common clinton and the fbi would love for you to convince them of thi it would save the u taxpayer a lot of money if you could todd
