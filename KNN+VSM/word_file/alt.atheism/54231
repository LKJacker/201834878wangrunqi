from keith keith allan schneider subject re cruel keith m ryan write i do think so although some form of execution be painful the electric chair look particularly so i think the pain be relatively short-lived drawing and quarter on the other hand look very painful and the victim would die right away he bleed to death i imagine ah so a cruel punishment be not just if it be painful a you origionally state it be about long term pain eg non short-lived why thi sudden chance in ymy stance i do think i change my stance at all my original stance wa that a painles execution wa not a cruel one i do say what would be consider cruel only that a painles death wa now cruelty must involve some sort of suffer i believe i do think someone that get shoot in the head or electrocute really suffer very much even a hang probably produce one sharp instance of pain but it over so quickly hmmmmm pardon could it be that a counter example ha be make which render ymy previou stance null and void why do you admit that ymy previou stance be incorrect or if you somehow manage to slip up and misstate ymy origional stance why not admit it no well again i state that a painles death be cruel but i do think i state that all painful execution be cruel i think that some be cruel depend on the nature and duration of the pain by the way how long be too long anything more than an instant i gues any death by suffocation asphyxiation or blood los would be cruel i think thi include the ga chamber and draw and quarter i say that any pain that last say over twenty second or so would be too long but thi may be an arbitrary cutoff i suppose keith
