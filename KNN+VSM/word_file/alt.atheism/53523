from vdp vinayak dutt subject re islam and scientific prediction wa in article khan umar khan write i strongly suggest that you look up a book call the bible the quran and science by maurice baucaille a french surgeon it be not comprehensive but it be well research i imagine ymy library ha it or can get it for you through interlibrary loan i shall try to get hold of it when i have time to read of course in short dr baucaille begin investigate the bible because of pre ceived scientific inaccuracy and inconsistency he assume that some of the problem may have be cause by poor translation in by go day so he read what he could find in hebrew greek aramaic what he find wa that the problem do go away they get worse then he decide to see if other religion have the same problem so he pick up the holy in french and find similar prob lem but not a many so he apply the same logoic a he have with the bible he learn to read it in arabic the problem he have find with the french version go away in arabic he wa unable to find a wealth of scientific statement in the holy but what he do find make sense with modern understand so he investigate the tradition the hadith to see what they have to say about science they be fill with science problem after all they be contemporary narrative from a time which have by pmy standard a primitive world view hi conclusion wa that while he wa impress that what little the holy have to say about science wa accurate he wa far more impress that the holy do not contain the same rampant error evidence in the tradition how would a man of century arabium have know what not to include in the holy assume he have author it so in short the writer or writer of quran decide to stay away from science if you do not open ymy mouth then you do put you foot into ymy mouth either but then if you say quran do not talk much about science then one can not make claim like bobby do that you have great science in quran basically i want to say that none of the religiou text be suppose to be scientific treatise so i be just request the theist to stop make such wild claim vinayak vinayak dutt e-mail vdp standard disclaimer apply
