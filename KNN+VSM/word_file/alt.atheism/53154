from sandvik kent sandvik subject re islamic genocide so pick former yugoslavium instead and say their problem be cause by communism it do really matter but i gues religiou leader be call for an end to that too so it ca be religiously motivate thi despite the fact that the christian carve cross in dead muslim chest maybe they just want land maybe it something else they want maybe the cro carve be just accidental i do know just look suspiciou most likely the tragic situation in bosnium be a combination of ethnical and religiou motive where religion be just one attribute that separate the group from each other but i must agree that the sad saga in bosnium be a terrible example of a case where religion be not help instead it be use a a weapon against other human and my sympathy be mostly on the bosnian side it look like the serb be the oppressor will to use even christianity a a weapon against their former friend cheer kent sandvik alink ksand private activity on the net
