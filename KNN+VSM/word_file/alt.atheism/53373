from spbach jame felder subject re some think in article bissda dan lawrence bissell write first i want to start right out and say that i a christian it make sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo book liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he write the book anyway he wa part of an effort to destroy christianity in the proces he become a christian himself sound like you be say he wa a part of some conspiracy just what organization do he belong to do it have a name the book say that jesu wa either a liar or he wa crazy a modern day koresh or he wa actually who he say he wa logic alert artificial trifercation the be many other possible explaination could have be that he never exist there have be some good point make in thi group that be not impossible that jc be an amalgam of a number of different myth mithra come to mind some reason why he would be a liar be a follow who would die for a lie would person be able to tell if he wa a liar person gather around him and keep do it many gather from hear or see someone who wa or have be heal call me a fool but i believe he do heal person logic alert argument from incredulity just because it be hard for you to believe thi do mean that it be true liar can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself site he ha follower that do think he be a fake and they have show that they be will to die by not give up after get shoot himself koresh ha show that he too be will to die for what he believe a far a heal go if i rememer right the heal that wa attribute be not consistent between the different gospel in one of them the heal that be do be not any more that faith healer can pull off today seem to me that the early gospel be that compel so the story get bigger to appeal better niether wa he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be draw to someone who wa crazy very doubtful in fact rediculou for example anyone who be draw to david koresh be obviously a fool logical person see thi right away therefore since he wa a liar or a lunatic he must have be the real thing or might not have exist or any number of thing that be the logical pitfall that those who use flaw logic like thi fall into there be bifurcation or trus quad etc that be valid because in the proceed step the person show conclusively that the alternative be all that be possible once everyone agree that the give set be indeed all there be then argument among the alternative can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduce by exclude all other possible alternative however if it can be show that the set be not all inclusive then any conclusion basis on the incomplete set be invalid even if the true choice be one of the original choice i have give at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that jc be the real mccoy just because he be one of the other two alternative be no longer valid some other thing to note he fulfil load of prophecy in the psalm isaiah and elsewhere in hr alone thi in hi betrayal and crucifixion i do have my bible with me at thi moment next time i write i will use it jc wa a rabbi he know what those prophecy be it would be any great shake to make sure one do a list of action that would fullfill prophecy what would be compel be if there be a set of clear and explicit prophecy and jc have absolutely no knowledge of then yet fullfilled them anyway i do think most person understand what a christian be it be certainly not what i see a lot in church rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god sake he love u enough to die and save u so we should do the same hey we ca do it god himself inspire u to turn my life over to him that tuff and most person do want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lift or guitar play drum whatever it take time we do rush it in one day christianity be ymy whole life it be not go to church once a week or help poor person once in a while we box everything into time unit such a work at thi time sport tv social life god be above these box and should be carry with u into all these box that we have create for ourself here i agree with you anyone who buy into thi load of mythology should take what it say seriously and what it say be that it must be a total way of life i have very little respect for xian that do if the myth be true then it be true in it entirity the pick and choose that i see a lot of leaf a bad taste in my mouth jim jame l felder sverdrup technology inc phone nasa lewi research center cleveland ohio email jfelder some person drink from the fountain of knowledge other person gargle
