from keith keith allan schneider subject re objective morality wa re political atheist livesey jon livesey write i want to know how thi omniscient be be go to perform the feat of definitely term action right or wrong if you be omniscient you know who exactly do what and with what purpose in mind then with a particular goal in mind you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not thi action wa in accordance with the general goal i do think you show the existence of any objective moral system they exist but in practice they be difficult to perfectly emulate i mean you understand the concept of an objective system right i think you be explain it to u i certainly do understand what you be explain in an objective system there be know goal then action be judge a either be compatible with these goal or not simple the problem with most system in current practice be that the goal differ that be the goal of each society be different note that an objective system be not necessarily an inherent one the concept of innocence be dependent on whether certain action be right or wrong and thi depend on the moral system but if we have an objective system then someone can be deem innocent or not quite easily by an omniscient person anyway i think i clear up the recursive definition of murder because no one be complain about it i do think it solf anything to speculate where we would be if we do have an objective moral system the question be still whether you can even say what one be i say it many many time and for what it worth i do think you clear up anything concern murder which part do you have a problem with what do you mean by harm is it harm if you have to spend ymy existence metabolise food for another specie oh most moral system would be consider only within a specie it be okay for u to enslave other animal right but not human of course ideally perhap we would even have to bother any other animal one the first point it wrong to enslave human accord to my persoanl moral system on the second point i a vegetarian but we can enslave the animal right but just not kill them or be you a vegetarian for health reason so be you a vegetarian no i fail to see how my personal view be relevant anyway is it wrong to eat animal in ymy personal moral system of course not it seem perfectly valid to kill member of other specie for food it might be nice though if the other animal be not make to suffer for instance a cow in a field life out it life just about the same way it would in the wild they seem happy enough however the veal youngster be treat very well how about an objective moral system i do know what be the goal of thi particular system there be no inherent system how about a natural moral system nope again it seem okay to kill other specie for food keith
