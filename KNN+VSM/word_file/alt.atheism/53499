from kempmp petrus pihko subject re consciousnes part ius kev strike back kevin anthoney kax write about my reply diplomatic it a society that be constantly on the verge of flame usenet diplomacy be the best way to ensure the voice of reason get through be it i realize i fight occam razor in thi argument so i try to explain why i feel a mind be necessary kevin unfortunately you be now delve into field i know too little about algorithm ymy reason a i see it be very much along the line of roger penrose who claim that mathematical can not be algorithmic in hi book the emperor new mind concerning computer mind and the law of physic however penrose claim that he ha mathematical insight or ymy similar claim that wavefunction collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusion we be obviouslu take very different viewpoint i try to ponder on the problem of consciousnes from an evolutionary perspective realise that it might not be anything special but certainly useful thinking back of what i write do you think worm have mind or not they be able to experience pain at least they behave just like that yet it be conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a total synthesi of c elegan from the element would such a worm have a mind firstly i not impress with the ability of algorithm they great at solve problem once the method ha be work out but not at work out the method itself thi be true to some extent however i do not think that my brain work like computer at all in fact there be substantial evidence skarda skarda freeman that brain work more or le chaotically generate enough randomnes for mental state to evolve my brain work much like genetic algorithm generator i suppose the trick still ha to be there in some form to be discover do thi mean that all the idea we will ever have be already pre-programmed into my brain thi be somewhat unlikely give that my brain ultimately be encode in chromosome worth of genetic material much of which be use indeed thi be extremely unlikely give the vast impact of nurture on my mind and brain i suggest however that before try to understand my consciousnes a a collection of algorithm kevin take a look at the reference i mention and think again i still think the best expert on the nature of a consciou mind be neurologist neuropsychologist and biologist but do not flame me for my opinion since they study be that be consciou the reason i be repeat my advice be that thi discussion can not lead to anywhere if my background be too different and please do not bring qm into thi discussion at all not all physicist be happy with the claim that my consciousnes play some special role in physic i would say it do the other problem with algorithm be their instability not many algorithm survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet person survive stroke without go completely haywire there be side-effect but patient still seem remarkably stable also neuron in perfectly healthy person be die at an alarm rate can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt variou bite of it code again brain be not computer do forget thi thi do not mean they need something else to work they just work differently their primary be perception and guidance of action self-awarenes and high intelligence be later appearance the next problem be the sticky question of what be colmy replace with the sensation of ymy choice presumably the materialist viewpoint be that it the product of some kind of chemical reaction the usual product of such a reaction be energy different chemical is colmy a mixture of these you be still expect that we could find the idea of in my brain somewhere perhap in the form of some chemical thi be not how i see it the sensation be a certain time-dependent pattern in the area of my visual cortex and it be distribute with the help of area and to the rest of the brain indeed a fire pattern i have sometime think of my consciousnes a a global free induction pattern of these local fire pattern but thi be just idle speculation scientific american september issue wa a special issue on mind and brain have you already read it from cover to cover there be two article on visual perception so you might be interest but again please note that subjective experience can not be observe from a third-person perspective if we see nothing but neuronal activity we can not go on to conclude that thi be not the mind kalat write about numerou example where electric stimulation of different area of brain have lead to variou change in the patient state of mind for instance a patient whose septal area wa stimulate without hi knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview wa quickly cure of hi depression and start discuss a plan to seduce hi girlfriend stimulation in the temporal lobe have sometime lead to embarrass situation when the patient have start flirt with the therapist in conclusion there be evidence that brain be essentially necessary for subjective experience brain damage be usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage consciou process involve substantial brain activity in variou area of brain when we think of colour my visual cortex be activate etc consciousnes be an afterthought we become consciou of my action with a half a second delay and my brain be ahead of my will by at least m thu i think it be fruitful to turn the question why do see colour around and ask what be thi that seem to be observe since it seem that my consciou mind be not the king of my brain if thi be so a computer wo see colmy because the chemistry be different do an algorithm that see colmy have a selective advantage over an equivalent that do it should because the output of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstance so why do we see colmy thi depend on what be mean by colour do a neural network that be capable of recognise handwritten number from to see the number if it be capable of sort them if you be ask why do an animal who be consciou of itself a an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who do i have a good answer read my previou post where i write why a sense of identity help social animal to swap role and act more morally so that they do unconsciously kill each other with newly discover weapon a bite extreme but thi be the basic idea when early homo become more and more efficient in use tool a sense of identity and the concept of have to evolve in line with thi development indeed respect for other and consciou altruistic behavimy might be evolutionary advantage for social animal such a early human if i remember correctly quantum mechanic consist of a wavefunction with two process act on it the first proces ha be call evolution or be govern by schroedinger equation and be well know the second proces call variou thing such a of the wavefunction or vector reduction or and be more mysteriou it be usually say to occur when a take place although nobody seem to know precisely when that occur when it do occur the effect of r be to abruptly change the wavefunction if mind be require for thi do thi mean that until human mind come to the scene wavefunction never collapse but remain in the superposition for aeon my how powerful we be thi ha be discuss before and i think thi topic be irrelevant since we do not agree that mind be necessary and neither do physicist anyway i speculate that mind would be in part x there seem to be some link between consciousnes and r in that we never see linear superposition of anything although there be alternative explaination for thi i no idea how a brain be suppose to acces part x but since thi be only speculation that wo matter too much my main point be that there might be a place for mind in physic i agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above physic need sharp mind to solve many real problem i go back to my nice pad cell now if that ok with you it ok if you do forget to take with you the reference i write about in
