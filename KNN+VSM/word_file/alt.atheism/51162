from keith keith allan schneider subject re political atheist reference line trim ssauyet scott d sauyet write first i make the assumption that you agree that a murderer be one who ha commit murder well i say that a murderer be one who intentionally commit a murder for instance if you put a bullet into a gun that wa think to contain blank and someone wa kill with such a gun the person who actually perform the action be the murderer but i gues thi be actually make clear in the below definition i be interest to see a more reasonable definition what do you mean by reasonable otherwise ymy inductive definition do bottom out ymy definition in essence be that murder be the intentional kill of someone who ha not commit murder against hi will expanding the second occurence of murder in the above we see that ye it be bad to include the word be define in the definition but even though the series be recursively infinite i think the mean can still be deduce i assume you can see the problem here to do a correct inductive definition you must define something in term of a simpler case and you must have one or several bottom out case for instance we can define the factorial function the function which assign to a positive integer the product of the positive integer le than or equal to it on the positive integer inductively a follow math lesson delete okay let look at thi situation suppose there be a longstanding feud between two family which claim that the other commit some travesty in the distant past each time a member of the one family kill a member of the other the other family think that it be justify in kill a that member of the first family now let suppose that thi sequence ha occur an infinite number of time or if you do like deal with infinity suppose that one member of the family go back into time and essentially begin the whole thing that be there be a never-ending loop of slay base on some non-existent travesty how do you resolve thi well they be all murder now i suppose that thi be totally applicable to ymy problem but it still be possible to reduce an uninduced system and in any case the nest murderer in the definition of murder can not be infintely recursive give the finite existence of humanity and a murder can not be commit without a kill involve so the first person to intentionally cause someone to get kill be necessarily a murderer is thi enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition see in a totally objective system where all the information be available such a nest definition be really a problem keith
