from livesey jon livesey subject re islamic genocide in article frank frank write in article k livesey jon livesey write false dichotomy you claim the kill be not religiously motivate and i say that wrong i not say that each and every kill be religiously motivate a i spell out in detail which kill do you say be religously motivate for example i would claim that the recent assassination of fmy catholic construction worker who have no connection with the ira wa probably religously motivate at the time of write i think that someone who claim the current violence be motivate by religion be reach what would you call be when someone write the kill in be not religously motivate now it possible to argue that religion in the past be a major contribute factor to the violence in the present but i do know of any evidence that thi be so and i not enough of a historian to debate it given that the avow aim of the ira be to take northern ireland into a country that ha a particular church write into it constitution and which ha restriction on civil right dictate by that church i fail to see why the word past be appropriate but to claim that the kill in be not religously motivate be grotesque all that mean be that the church and believer be do what they alway do with history they ca face they rewrite it you attack a different claim my claim be that when an ira terrorist plant a bomb in warrington do not have a a motive the greater glory of god sorry frank but what i put in quote be ymy own word from ymy post do tell u now that it a different claim if you can no longer stand behind ymy original claim just say so i mean the same thing when i say the kill in be not religously motivate a i do when i say when a terrorist plant a bomb do have a religiou motive the example be mean to clarify not to be a new claim the different claim to which i refer be the claim which you be seemingly attack in the previou post namely that religion be not a major historical cause of the present violence i do assert that nor do i assert it opposite you do have to hand u a bunch of double-talk about what i wa seemingly attack i quote what i wa attack jon
