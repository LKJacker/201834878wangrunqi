from jbrown subject re death penalty gulf war in article mathew mathew write rush voelkerding write in article chrisb chri blask write add to thi the outrageou cost of put someone to death special cell block year of court cost extra guard and the benefit of the death penalty entirely disappear that because of ymy earlier claim that the one innocent death override the benefit of all the other obviously it tragic but it be no argument for do away with the death penalty if we go to war and worry about accidentally kill civilian all of the time because my determination of who the enemy really be be imperfect then there be no way to win the war ye fortunately we have right-thinking folk like ymy good self in power and it wa therefore deem acceptable to slaughter ten or even hundred of thousand of iraqi in order to liberate we win the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi death be way over-exaggerated and exploit for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news medium the fact be that le iraqi die in the gulf war than do civilian in any other war of comparable size thi century thi wa due mostly to the short duration couple with precise surgical bomb technique which be technically possible only recently the idea that hundred of thousand of iraqi citizen die be ludicrou not even hundred of thousand of iraqi soldier die and they be the one be target or do you think that the u and it ally be specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilian either the smart bomb do hit their target and we know they do or they be target civilian target which be hardly condusive to destroy iraq military potential the military mission planner be not fool they know they have to hit military target to win a war hitting civilian target do nothing but unite the person against you not a laudable goal if one want the person to rise up against their tyrant-dictator ok so some innocent person die ye maybe the unarm civilian flee along that road do need to be bomb to bite perhap that kid with half hi face burn off and the little girl with the mangle leg be entirely guilty but it worth the death of a few innocent to save the of the kuwaitus person be it after all the iraqi may not have have a chance to vote for saddam but they show their acceptance of hi regime by not assassinate him right all that surrender and flee along open road wa just a deviou ploy we be entirely within my right to bomb just in case without find out if they be soldier how about all the innocent person who die in blanket-bombing in i do hear you bemoan them war be never an exact science but with smart bomb it become more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualty sometime mistake be make target be misidentified innocent die that war the way it really be but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictator to treat the earth like it one big rummage sale grab everything they can get be worse like patrick henry say some year ago i know not what course other may take but a for me give me liberty or give me death war be alway the price one must be will to pay if one wish to stay free the death penalty wa conceive a a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigan that have be add automatic appeal lengthy court battle etc have relegate that purpose to a very small part of what it should be hence the question be do we instate the death penalty a it wa mean to be and see if that deter crime or do we get rid of it entirely ye let reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be all that shit about fair trial and a court of appeal just get in the way of justice let give the polouse the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save ourself the expense of all those lawyer think of the knock-on benefit too la would never have have to spend so much money clean up after riot and hold showcase trial if the cop have be allow to do their job properly a quick bullet through the head of rodney king and another for the cameraman and everyone would have be save a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense after all if the polouse decide a man guilty that ought to be enough the fact that the death penalty ha be show not to have any deterrent effect over imprisonment well that entirely irrelevant mathew mathew ymy sarcasm be note but you be completely off-base here you come off sound like a complete peace-nik idiot although i feel sure that wa not ymy intent so the iraqi war wa wrong eh i sure that appeasement would have work better than war just like it do in eh i gues we should have fight either just think of all those innocent german civilian kill in dresden and hamburg how about all the poor french who die in the crossfire because we invade the continent we should have just let hitler take over europe and you be speak german instead of english right now tyrant like hussein have to be stop hi kind do understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret be that bush wimped out and do have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein be still in power and the iraqi person sacrifice not to mention the american who die wa for naught liberating kuwait wa a good thing but wipe hussein off the map would be better and a for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial bring back a verdict of not guilty those who have be foam at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have look no further than the video tape but the jury look at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not see when one make a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be present on both side one ha simply lower himself to the level of vigilante justice a state-of-mind which ymy sarcasm above seemingly speak against but instead tend to support in the case against the policeman law in thi country be intend to protect the right of the accuse whether they be criminal or cop one be not find guilty if there be a reasonable doubt of one guilt and only the jury be in a position to ass the evidence and render a verdict anyone else be simply succumb to verbal vigilantism regard jim b
