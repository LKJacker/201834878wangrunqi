from frank frank subject re islamic genocide in article livesey jon livesey write in article frank frank write in article livesey jon livesey write noting that a particular society in thi case the mainland uk ha few religously motivate murder and few murder of any kind say very little about whether inter-religion murder elsewhere be religiously motivate no but it allow one to conclude that there be nothing inherent in all religion or for that matter in catholicism and protestantism that motivate one to kill motivate or allow the christian bible say that one may kill under certain circumstance in fact it instruct one to kill under certain circumstance i say the majority of person have a moral system that instruct them to kill under certain circumstance i do get ymy distinction between motivate and allow and i do agree that if a flavmy of theism atoricity then that an indictment of that theism but it rather depend on what the circumstance be when you talk about christianity or islam then at least ymy claim can be understand it when person go to a general statement about theism that it fall apart one could believe in a god which instruct one to be utterly harmles for my part i conclude that something else be require i also happen to believe that that something else will work no le well without religion any easy will do and what do religion supply if not an easy not necessarily love thy neighbmy do not supply a it demolish it and my definition of religion be broader than my definition of theism a i have explain by insist that even the murder of fmy labourer choose because they be catholic and who have nothing to do with the ira by protestant extremist be not religously motivate i think what you be say be that you simply will not accept any murder a be religiously motivate no what about that guy who cut off someone head because he believe he wa the devil incarnate that wa religously motivate what about the protestant extremist who kill fmy catholic labourer that religiously motivate not in my opinion if they be do it because of some obscure point of theology then ye but since all protestant do do thi nor do they elect extremist to do it for them it just too broad too say religion do thi i say that the cause be far more complex than that take away the religiou element and you still have the powerful motive of revenge and misguide patriotism you know when most catholic and protestant worldwide say the kill one might listen to that especially when you claim not to read mind also the murder ensue from the fatwa on mr rushdie the inquisition and the many religou war what so special about these exception is thi all just a grab-bag of ad-hoc excuse for not consider some other murder to be religiously motivate what the general principle behind all thi the general principle be that it fairly clear to me at least that religion be the primary motivator enabler whatever of these it not nearly so obviou what go on when one look at ni apart from violence of course it not an abstract argument northern irish protestant say we do want to be absorb into be officially catholic country now what be we suppose to do are we suppose to reply no that only what you think you do want mr assure u that no matter what you say you want you really want something else you think the unionist would mind be absorb into a non-catholic country other than the uk of course it a terrible thing to lose a mind maybe the word country be there for more than just kick i certainly do believe that the unionist be in it for god i think they wish to maintain their position of privilege i still listen to what they say and you be still tell u ymy version of what they think you read mind and i do you speculate on my motive often enough and you do take my statement of my own belief at face value therefore ymy claim not to read mind ha no credibility with me sorry i also note that you fail to answer my question it just look to me very much like you have an axe to grind especially a you be indeed ignore what most protestant say which be stop the kill the person you refer to be properly describe a unionist not protestant a for their position of privilege what be that if not religion base it be base on politic bigotry and heartles extremism none of these thing be synonymou with religion though there be certainly some overlap frank not hatch that odwyer from hen by evelyn conlon
