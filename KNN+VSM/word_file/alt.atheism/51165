from trajan stephen mcintyre subject re the problem of satan use to be islamic authority over woman in article trajan stephen mcintyre write of course bobby then state that satan ha no free will that he do a god want him to thi bring up a host of paradox be god therefore evil do i have free will or be god direct me also if god be evil which part of hi infinite self be good and which be evil etc i would like for once a solid answer not a run-about i hope i give you a fairly solid answer to thi one i simply do agree with the embody version of a satan who be a separate creation or a force i write the belief to which i ascribe be that evil be not a creation rather it be the absence of good thi fit with all the logic about thing have dual use a knife can be use to sculpt and it can be use to kill like entropy evil be see in thi view a neither force nor entity satan be therefore metaphorical in fact there be several verse of the holy which appear to support thi view and several tradition a well for example there be a tradition that food should never be leave open on a shelf or table overnight lest satan enter it it appear that thi be a reference to a yet undiscovered germ thu the evil effect of spoil food be describe a satan but there be many example of satan personify which be i to believe and there be quite physical description of heaven and hell in the holy the bible etc there have be time in the spiritual and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical description of heaven hell and satan be take quite literally and that work for the time a i mention in the tradition cite above for example it wa sufficient in the absence of a theory about germ and disease spread by worm to simply describe the evil which wa pass to a consumer of spoil food a satanic which beg the question if satan in thi case be metaphorical how can you be certain allah be not the same way the bottom line here however be that describe a spiritual plane in human language be something like describe color to a person who ha be blind from birth you may want to read the book flatland if you have already or the dragon egg the first be intend a a light hearted description of a mathematical con cept some delete for space save when language fail because it can not be use to adequately describe another dimension which can not be experience by the speaker then such convention a metaphor allegory and the like come to be necessary the unseen be describe in term which have reference and mean for the but like all model a compro mise must be make when speak metaphorically clarity and directnes of mean equivalence of perception and the like be all cripple but what else can you do thi be why i ask the above how would you then know god exist a a spirit or be rather than just be metaphorical i mean it okay to say well satan be just metaphorical but then you have to justify thi belief and justify that god be not some metaphor for something else i say thi because there be many many instance of satan describe a a be such a the tormentor in the old testament book of job or the temptor in the new testament gospel in the same way god too be describe a a be or spirit how be i to know one be metaphorical and not the other further belief in god be a bar to evil let consider the case of satanist even if satan be metaphorical the satanist would have to believe in god to justify thi belief again we have a case where someone do believe in god but by religiou standard they be evil if bobby do see thi let him addres thi question also delete some more on metaphor obviously more philosophize on thi issue be possible but i not sure that the reader of thi newsgroup would want to delve into religiou interpretation further however if anyone wish to discus thi i certainly will either off line e-mail or on line post stephen atheist libertarian pro-individuality pro-responsibility jr and all that jazz
