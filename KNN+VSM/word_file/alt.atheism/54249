from mcelwre subject free-energy technology free-energy technology by robert e mcelwaine physicist ninety to a hundred year ago everybody know that a heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly it would violate the law of physic all of the expert and authority say so for example simon newcomb declare in the demonstration that no possible combination of know substance know form of machinery and know form of force can be unite in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distance through the air seem to the writer a complete a it be possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be fortunately a few smart person such a the wright brother do not accept such pronouncement a the final word now we take airplane for grant except when they crash today orthodox physicist and other scientist be say similar thing against several kind of energy technology use negative term such a pseudo-science and perpetual motion and cite so-called law which assert that energy can not be create or destroy law of thermodynamic and there be alway a decrease in useful energy law of thermodynamic the physicist do not know how to do certain thing so they arrogantly declare that those thing can not be do such principle of impotence be common in orthodox modern science and help to cover up inconsistency and contradiction in orthodox modern theory free energy invention be device which can tap a seemingly unlimited supply of energy from the universe with out burn any kind of fuel make them the perfect solution to the world-wide energy crisi and it associate pollution degradation and depletion of the environment most free energy device probably do not create energy but rather tap into existing natural energy source by variou form of induction unlike solar or wind device they need little or no energy storage capacity because they can tap a much energy a need when need solar energy ha the dis-advantage that the sun be often block by cloud tree build or the earth itself or be reduce by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitude and high latitude likewise wind speed be widely variable and often non-existent neither solar nor wind power be suitable to directly power car and airplane properly design free energy device do not have such limitation for example at least three patent and have so far be award for motor that run exclusively on permanent magnet seemingly tap into energy circulate through the earth magnetic field the first two require a feedback network in order to be self-running the third one a describe in detail in science mechanic magazine spring amazing magnet-powered motor by jorma hyypium page and front cover require critical size shape orientation and space of magnet but no feedback such a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible heatpump in one home year round for free complete descriptive copy of patent be each from the patent office jefferson davi hwy arlington va correct patent number require or try get copy of both the article and the patent vium ymy local public or university library inter-library loan dept a second type of free-energy device such a the motor patent the coil and the motor of inventor joseph newman see science page tap electro-magnetic energy by induction from resonance about cycle per second plu harmonic they typically have a gap in the circuit which serve to synchronize the energy in the coil with the energy be tap it be important that the total and of the device combine to at the same frequency a resonance in order to maximize the power output thi output can also be increase by center the spark gap at the center of a strong u-shaped permanent magnet in the case of a tesla coil slip a choke coil around the secondary coil will enhance output power earth energy fuelles propulsion power system by john bigelow health research box mokelumne hill ca during the an austrian civil engineer name viktor schauberger invent and partially develop an turbine german name after analyze erosion and lack of erosion in differently shape waterway and develop sophisticate mathematical equation to explain it a describe in the book a breakthrough to new free-energy source by dan a davidson water be pump by an impeller pump through a logarithmic-spiral-shaped coil of tube until it reach a critical velocity the water then implode no longer touch the inside wall of the tube and drife the pump which then convert the pump motor into an electric generator the device seem to be tap energy from that of the earth rotation vium the effect like a tornado it can also neutralize gravity a fourth type of free energy device be the air motor patent which be a cro between a diesel engine it ha three cylinder with a compression ratio of to and a rotary engine with solar and planetary gear it burn no fuel but become self-running by drive it own air compressor thi engine also generate a lot of heat which could be use to heat build and it very high torque make it ideal for large truck prevent their slow down when climb hill david mcclintock be also the real original inventor of the automatic transmission differential and drive crystal may someday be use to supply energy a show in the star trek show perhap by insert each one between metal capacitor plate and bombard it with a beam of particle from a small radioactive source like that use in a common household smoke detector one other energy source should be mention here despite the fact that it do not fit the definition of free energy a bulgarian-born american physicist name joseph maglich ha invent and partially develop an atomic fusion reactor which he call which use non-radioactive deuterium a a fuel available in nearly unlimited quantity from sea water do not produce radioactive waste can be convert directly into electricity with-out energy-wasting steam turbine and can be construct small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city and unlike the tokamak and laser fusion monstrosity that we read about migma work already produce at least three watt of power for every watt put in new time version page and then there be the fusion experiment that have be in the news lately originally conduct by university of utah researcher b stanley pon and martin fleischmann some navy researcher at the china lake naval weapon center in californium under the direction of chemist melvin mile finally take the trouble to collect the bubble come from such an apparatu have them analyze with mass-spectrometry technique and find helium which profe that atomic fusion do indeed take place and enough of it to explain the exces heat generate there be good indication that the two so-called law of thermodynamic be not so absolute for example the late physicist dewey b larson develop a comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he call the system which he describe in detail in several book such a nothing but motion and the universe of motion in which the physical universe ha two distinct half the material half and an anti-matter half with a continuou cycle of matter and energy pass between them with-out the heat death predict by thermodynamic law hi theory explain the universe much better than modern orthodox theory include phenomenon that orthodox physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about and be self-consistent in every way some free energy device might be tap into that energy flow seemingly convert low-quality energy into high-quality energy also certain religiou organization such a mat and teach their member that the physical universe be only the lowest of at least a dozen major level of existence like parallel universe or analogou to tv channel a describe in book like the path of the master by dr julian johnson and eckankar the key to secret world by srus paul twitchell for example the next level up from the physical universe be commonly call the plane long-time member of these group have learn to travel into these higher world and report on condition there it seem plausible that energy could flow down from these higher level into the physical universe or be create at the boundary between them give the right configuration of matter to channel it thi be support by many successful laboratory-controlled experiment in psycho-kinesi throughout the world such a those describe in the book psychic discovery behind the iron curtain in term of economic the market ha failed inventor do not have enough money and other resource to fully develop and mass-produce free energy equipment and the conventional energy producer have no desire to do so because of their ve ted intere t the government be need to intervene if the government do not intervene then the total supply of energy resource from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out price for energy will increase and pollution and it harmful effect include the effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spill rape of the land by strip mine etc will continue to increase the government should subsidize research and development of free energy by inventor and university subsidize private production until the producer can make it on their own and subsidize consumption by low-income consumer of free energy hardware the long-range effect of such government intervention would be wide-spread and profound the quantity of energy demand from conventional energy producer coal mine companie oil companie and country electric utilitie etc would drop to near zero force their employee to seek work elsewhere energy resource coal uranium oil and ga would be leave in the grind price for conventional energy supply would also drop to near zero while the price of free energy equipment would start out high but drop a supply increase a happen with vcr personal computer etc cost of produce product that require large quantity of energy to produce would decrease along with their price to consumer consumer would be able to realize the opportunity cost of pay electric utility bill or buy home heat fuel tourism would benefit and increase because traveler would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their car government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuel would have to be obtain in some other way and energy could no longer be used a a motive or excuse for making war many conventional energy producer would go out of busines but society a a whole and the earth environment and ecosystem would benefit greatly it be the person that government should serve rather than the big corporation and bank for more information answer to ymy question etc please consult my cited source patent article book un-altered reproduction and dissemination of thi important information be encouraged robert e
