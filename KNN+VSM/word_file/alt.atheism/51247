from lucio lucio de re subject re atheist tony lezard tony write my opinion be that the strong atheist position require too much belief for me to be comfortable with any strong atheist out there care to comment a far a i can tell strong atheist be far outnumber on by weak atheist at the cost of repudiate the faq i think too much be make of the strong v weak atheism issue although in the context of where we continually attack on the basi that strong atheist believe in the non-existence of god i think the separation be a valid one to cover my arse what i try to say be that there be an infinitely grey area between weak and strong a well a between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism i wish wherea i logically can only support the weak atheist position in effect i be a strong atheist and wish i could be a mathematical one to justify my strong atheist position i believe i need only show that the evidence present in favmy of any of the god under scrutiny be faulty if i read the faq correctly no argument for the existence of god generic a represent by mainstream theologian ha ever be find to be unassailable to me thi be adequate evidence that the be undefinable or at least no definition ha yet be find to be watertight which in turn i accept a sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god i a little fuzzy on the edge though so opinion be welcome but perhap we should change the thread subject lucio de re lucio tab stop at fmy
