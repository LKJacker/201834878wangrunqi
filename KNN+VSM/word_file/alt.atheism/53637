from frank frank subject re genocide be caused by theism evidence to benedikt roseneau in article frank frank write the information of that be invariant under ymy child be a son or a daughter and sing about santum clau wa ymy argument that there ha to be more more than what more than we assume which be what exactly a most of the person i debate disagree with my premise hardly debate otherwise ymy favorite point that we sense so it h to be there ha be challenge more than once when i do it you say good question and do not addres it i address it ymy caricature be not my favourite point needle to say at length in a previou out and be currently discuss it with eric rescorla b there little point in respond the same point everywhere i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply you still repeat that point i do curiou since i believe that wa the first time i ever make it not that repetition would imply much more than ymy seem inability to understand you ask me the same question i give you the same answer especially when in thi case i know the answer to be true i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone be make the same point and i push for time then i try to respond what i believe be the strongest formulation of those point if that do include ymy post tough thi be usenet and life be tough all over c since there a great deal of response thi be alway feasible i do my best to honestly answer question put to me you drop out of debate with some poster and continue with other you appear with the same issue every n month and start the dicussion at the begin again i only debate thi issue twice in and occasionally in the first wa in response to simon clippingdale positive assertion that disagreement about moral value inexorably acknowledge that moral be relative it do now simon ha drop out of the debate for some time i take that to mean that he be either busy or bore with the topic i certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty do you d i ca alway understand what you say neither ca i understand you all the time usually one ask what the other side mean usually one do usually you clear but sometime you be and i ask you what you mean other time you seem to get extremely uptight and i feel that i debate against line noise sometime i get tire and sometime i have other thing i rather do again thi be usenet and life be tough all over you go to have to deal with it e you start to get personally insult i may not even put ymy name in the hat in future that suppose to be a threat no that a simple statement and an assertion that i be not answerable to those who offer me baseles insult for example those who accuse me of lie about my personal belief while also complain that i do answer their question like that you what you sense be evidence for the sense to be there if only everything would be so easy what almost everyone sense be evidence for the sense to be there because to all intent and purpose it be there we have that argument for one ymy claim that everyone sense it be not found and you have be ask to give evidence for it often and then the correct statement would be it be reason to assume that it be there unles evidence against it ha be find i have no problem with the second statement i have provide an argument that almost everyone sense that freedom be valuable the only cogent objection to thi come from jon livesey and wa offer by some other person too essentially that person disagree about fuzzy concept such a freedom it a good point and i think about it ymy trick be to say i feel a be not right and so do many i know therefore a be absolutely right it neglect the possibility that these person consider a to be right a an effect of the same proces restrict the claim of it absolutenes to those who have be subject of that proces in other word refute it you make the ontological claim you have to prove it nonsense my trick be to say i feel that a be better than b and so do almost any disinterested person i ask best evidence be therefore that a really be better than b subject to the assumption that we can establish to my mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b and that the result system of value be self-consistent now get thi really be better be an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that real material existence be a fictional model it may or may not correspond to something true it be nonetheles a useful assumption far more useful than the equally assume relativist trick to wit i feel that a be better than b and so do almost any disinterested person i ask however if even one person disagree that a be better than b or if even one person dissent from mutually agree definition of a and b then it be the case that b be better than a for that person and nothing more can be say i say thi be useles because it inexorably imply that a supermajority seek to maximise a can not morally take action against someone seek to maximise b a terrorist to do that would be to claim that a supermajority carefully consider morality would be better than the terrorist which would of course be true but a no-no for an ethical relativist to claim that ethical relativism imply anything else be simply weasel word and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion for a similar argument i sense morality be subjective it do not hurt me to do thing that be consider to be objectively wrong by other if you mean that you do thing that some other consider objectively wrong and it turn out not to be the case for you of course thi be possible it be neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence against objectivism except sometime in a pragmatic sense it serve a a counterexample for that everything that be subject to judgement be absolute and a long a you do provide evidence for that there be something universally agree upon there be no reason to believe ymy hypothesi i do thi freedom with the proviso that i still have to answer jon objection that fuzzy concept like freedom have no objective mean further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective you would have to show that it be independent of human or the attribute above look quite mislead not really what evidence be there that anything exist independently of human you be hard press to find any that be logically equivalent when apply to value an analogou set of premise would be premise some person believe that objectively speak the shortest route from my house to a bar be through the main entrance of the estate and down the malahide road premise i check it out and find that the shortest route from my which be much closer you would never deduce from these that there be no shortest route from my house to a bar yet that be seemingly how you derive ymy relativist claim use premise which be logically no different no moral be a matter of belief so far the person still believe that the shortest way be through the main entrance no agreement on belief here and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there be a shortest way and that there be a method to convince everyone of that it be the shortest way indeed in other word ymy analogy work only when one assume that ymy premise be right in the first place if not it be a fallacy and if thi be an argument for objectivism you be right it be though it a demonstration that the argument you give me be neither argument against objectivism nor argument for relativism ymy gimmick be to assume in the first place that value be real and to use thi to prove that value be real in other word you beg the question against me frank not hatch that odwyer from hen by evelyn conlon
