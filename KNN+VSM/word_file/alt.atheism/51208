from ingle ray ingle subject re concerning god morality wa american and evolution in article jbrown write why do baby get disease etc what god do create wa life accord to a protein code which be mutable and can evolve without delve into a deep discussion of creationism v evolutionism here the main problem the scenario you outline be reasonably consistent but all the evidence that i be familiar with not only do not support it but indicate something far different the earth by latest estimate be about billion year old and ha have life for about billion of those year human have only be around for at most about year but the fossil evidence inidcate that life ha be change and evolve and in fact disease-ridden long before there be person ye there be fossil that show sign of disease mostly bone disorder of course but there be some heck not just fossil evidence but what we be able to glean from genetic study show that disease ha be around for a long long time if human sin wa what bring about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before human god create the original genetic code perfect and without flaw and without get sidetrack into the theological ramification of the original sin the main effect of the so-called original sin for thi discussion wa to remove humanity from god protection since by their choice a e cut themself off from intimate fellowship with god in addition their sin cause them to come under the dominion of satan who then assume dominion over the earth deletion since humanity wa no longer under god protection but under satan dominion it wa no great feat for satan to genetically engineer disease both and genetic although the force of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of specie the degeneration of the genetic code tend to more than offset thi uh i know of many evolutionary biologist who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with thi there be no evidence that the human genetic code or any other off in perfect condition it seem to adapt to it envionment in a collective sense i really curiou a to what you mean by degeneration of the genetic code human dna be more complex tend to accumulate error adversely affect my well-being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacterium and viruse tend to become more efficient in cause infection and disease it be a bad combination umm nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapt to viruse and bacterium and they to u only a very small percentage of microlife be harmful to human and that small percentage seem to be reasonalby constant in size but the rank keep change for example bubonic plague use to be a really nasty disease i sure you agree but it still pop up from time to time even today and do do a much damage part of that be because of better sanitation but even when person get the disease the symptom tend to be le severe than in the past thi seem to be partly because person who be very susceptible die off long ago and because the really nasty variant forgive the poor terminology i an engineer not a doctor and die off for lack of nearby host i could be wrong on thi but from what i gather acne be only a few hundred year old and use to be nastier though no killer it seem to be get le nasty hence we have newborn that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial now wait a minute i have a question human be create perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seem unlikely that satan who make the disease would also gift human with the mean to fight them off simpler to make the disease le lethal if he want survivor a far a i can see my immune system imperfect though they may presently be must have be build into u by god i want to be clear on thi be you say that god wa plan ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by build an immune system that wa not at the time of design necessary that be god make my immune system ahead of time know that adam and eve would sin and their descendent would need to fight off disease thi may be more of a explanation than you be prepare to accept but god be not responsible for disease even if satan have nothing to do with the original inception of disease evolution by random chance would have produce them since humanity forsake god protection here another puzzle what exactly do you mean by in the phrase perfect and without flaw to my mind a system would be incapable of degrade over time a system that will without constant intervention become imperfect be not a perfect system at least imho or be it that god do something like write a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrapper hold together with elmer glue that be the original genetic be perfect but be in inferior material that have to be carefully tend or would fall apart if so why could god not have use better material wa god incapable of create a system that could maintain itself of do it just choose not to deletion in summary newborn be innocent but god do not cause their suffer my main point a i say wa that there really be any evidence for the explanation you give at least that i aware of but i could help make a few nitpick here and there sincerely ray ingle the above opinion be probably not those of the university of ingle michigan yet
