from keith keith allan schneider subject re pompou a write many person would probably think especially if the fanatic propogandized thi that thi wa a conflict between the atheist and the religiou many would get the impression that we be try to outlaw religion if we contintue to try to remove all thing with a religiou reference that not what the person i ask think perhap you would be right if you say the fundamentalist would think thi way after all they think they be be oppress when they be not allow to oppres however you have not show where you get thi idea that person would think it atheism v religion winner take all a far a i can tell it be ymy groundles prediction that thi will happen but you have take into the account of propoganda remember if you ask german before wwius if the jew shoudl be slaughter they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine roll through at least some be able to tolerate it you see it only take a small group of fanatic to whip up a general frenzy the propoganda machine have be in gear over a number of issue include abortion and gay look at some of the thing that have happen well so far they have pass one amendment which be currently under intense scrutiny and they have fail to outlaw abortion which be their prime goal on that issue yep they seem sooo effective sure well they have manage to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the court but they have manage to create quite a few problem for person that want to have an abortion they could create similar problem for u and it could be worse they can try to stop abortion by block clinic etc but imagine what they have to do to stop atheism beside the margin of error be very large when you only talk to two person better than ymy one that be ymy opinion also i have branch out and the informal survey be up over half a dozen now and what have they say were you question unbiased keith you would claim that my question be bias the minute i post them because the answer agree with me everyone i have ask about the possible removal of the motto the christian portion ha express regret about it los because they like it however when it be point out to them that a new motto will not be in the work none have express the desire to rape murder pillage etc which you have basically claim so you be able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them a whole nation a for the atheist portion i know some around here they have all express disgust with the motto some note be harass by christian who use the motto to try to seem justify and all would see it go ye i be glad if it be go to i never support it however i think that it be a minor problem that can be easily ignore contrast with what could happen an what may be likely which christian design the motto do the motto say anything about jesu why do you think that it refer only to christian christian write it christian think that their religion be right and all other be wrong therefore why would they other religion in the realm of be correct i doubt that any other religion be mean to be include well i be not clear on the religiou conviction of franci scott key the motto can be attribute to him but it be at least clear that he believe in a god and surely there be a few christian that think a you say but i do think that most do do you think that all christian actively despise other religion most that i have meet have and do do so no christian that i have query think it mean anything but them and only them why not ask some person of other faith sorry i would but christianity be just so awfully popular around here suppose you could ask a few person well i have ask a hindu moselem and a few jew and all of them think that it be applicable to them of course i ca say that these person just some that i know pretty well be accurate representation of their faith it be alway a good idea to assume that there be dissent view on any give issue you be assume that all the view be the same and nothing lead to thi conclusion without evidence to the contrary i doubt that there be dissent opinion you claim there be provide some evidence for ymy assertion well i really like to and i try but i really do know where to get acces to congressional record from the can anyone help out here comparing christian to nazi interesting only in the sense that neither can probably convince to change their belief no again the motto on the money do cost you anything extra however if you abolish the motto we all have to pay to have all the dy and plate redo like person pay before to get them change to have the motto on them you now need to show that there be a good reason to change everything again also i doubt that they use same plate for more than a year print thi would make it easy to remove the motto simply make next year plate without it ymy claim evidently be that they will have to pay extra somewhere provide some evidence for thi assertion so be you say that they redesign the plate each year anyway ymy whole argument conveniently delete i see wa that the motto somehow cost u all a lot of money thi be just not correct the one i read do mention anything about jesu i think the issue wa concern the distinction between religion and not how could it be between religiou and not religiou the motto refer to god it be a religiou motto the question be whether or not it be only christian you say it be more i doubt thi provide some evidence for thi assertion that be to say the religion of thi country and the non-religion of the ussr that wa what most of those quote be about and some include all atheist in general a well i do think that any of the quote although i seem to have lose them mention anything at all about jesu they advocate religion over non-religion a specific religion wa not mention you have miss thi point i say that the motto do say anything about anyone in particular that be the motto do imply anything about ymy particular belief it do say that everyone trust in some form of god only that the nation on the whole do we have be through thi before it obviou it do not include me thi much be beyond doubt ymy claim again be that the motto refer to more than christian based on the fact that christianity say all other religion be wrong and because it seem that the motto wa write by christian i doubt ymy claim so you be say that all christian must believe that all other religion should be outlaw just because they think they be wrong that silly i think the flat-earther be wrong but i do advocate their banishment based on thi idea i doubt that any additional expense would even be incur by remove the motto provide some evidence for ymy claim that it would i think that any such cost would be insignificant i mention the slight cost because you say that the motto wa cost u a lot of money by be on my currency disregarding the digression of the other motto if it be use for harassment and no other purpose ha be find for it why should it not be remove well motto in general do really have purpose i do think it should be remove because i think the benefit would be outweigh by the consequence and do you know what the vote wa were there other opinion do you think that the main reason the motto wa require by law wa to bother atheist do you think that thi be what the majority of congres at the time have in mind if you do then show why again it be the opinion of the person who put it there that i be concern with then you should be concern with the opinion of the entire congres again it be not necessary that the complete majority share the purpose of confront communism with thi motto why not it be the majority that put it there the general public probably do not know about the anti-atheist intent of a few person in the either i daresay more person remember the than the time when key write the anthem but do they remember the debate surround the motto do they remember that some person intend it to be a message against atheist why do you include thi in ymy little survey that you be conduct you claim here that scientist would believe someone claim i doubt thi provide evidence for ymy assertion what should i ask some scientist the probability that something einstein say about relativity be worthy i mean if einstein say it there a good chance that it wa right at least at the time a for the court the method scientist use can be apply i need not agree with the court by default because of a record you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decision would be good evidence in favor of some point what but you say you do agree with the court because they allow congres to attempt to make an amendment prohibit flag burn if you do realize that something like thi be external to the realm of the court power then how can i be confident that you know anything about the court power i mean if you do know how the court work how can you participate in a discussion of the court a judge can go to speak before congres and still you ignore the abortion gag rule a you make ymy claim on abortion no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court justice to testify before congres during the consideration of a constitutional amendment and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be present mushroom flower tree build sign whatever the analogy be the same just because something that i might find offensive be present do mean that my right be be violate we be talk about something put there by person keith not a mushroom no one cause that mushroom to exist unles you find thing offensive in a mushroom farm ye some mushroom can be plant and i do appreciate mushroom on my pizza either thi be not the case with the motto and you ignore the harassment which be the only know result of the motto and you ignore that somewhere along the line person be force to put the motto there who wa force to put the motto there what do you mean keith
