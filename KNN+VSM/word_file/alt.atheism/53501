from kax kevin anthoney subject re consciousnes part ius kev strike back in article kempmp petrus pihko write kevin anthoney kax write thi post be probably either brilliant or insane do let me know which a brilliant example of use the introspective objection against materialist theory of consciousnes diplomatic i realize i fight occam razor in thi argument so i try to explain why i feel a mind be necessary firstly i not impress with the ability of algorithm they great at solve problem once the method ha be work out but not at work out the method itself a a specific example i like to solve numerical crossword not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answer type the hard one to do these with any efficiency you need to figure out a variety of trick now i know that you can program a computer to do these puzzle but in do so you have to work out the trick yourself and program them into the computer you can of course the trick and write the program so that it be uncover but a far a i can see the trick still ha to be there in some form to be discover do thi mean that all the idea we will ever have be already pre-programmed into my brain thi be somewhat unlikely give that my brain ultimately be encode in chromosome worth of genetic material much of which be use one way around thi be to bring the environment into the equation but again a far a i can see thi still ha an air of you see object x then perform action y and we do seem to get anywhere the algorithm ha to anticipate what it might see and what conclusion to draw from it experience the other problem with algorithm be their instability not many algorithm survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet person survive stroke without go completely haywire there be side-effect but patient still seem remarkably stable also neuron in perfectly healthy person be die at an alarm rate can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt variou bite of it code the next problem be the sticky question of what be colmy replace with the sensation of ymy choice presumably the materialist viewpoint be that it the product of some kind of chemical reaction the usual product of such a reaction be energy different chemical is colmy a mixture of these if thi be so a computer wo see colmy because the chemistry be different do an algorithm that see colmy have a selective advantage over an equivalent that do it should because the output of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstance so why do we see colmy however such a view be actually a nonsolution how should mind be able to act a observer feel pain and pleasure and issue command any better than the brain moreover how do the interaction occur a bite of idle speculation if i remember correctly quantum mechanic consist of a wavefunction with two process act on it the first proces ha be call evolution or be govern by schroedinger equation and be well know the second proces call variou thing such a of the wavefunction or vector reduction or and be more mysteriou it be usually say to occur when a take place although nobody seem to know precisely when that occur when it do occur the effect of r be to abruptly change the wavefunction i envisage r a an interaction between the wavefunction and else which i shall imaginitively call x it seem reasonable to assume that something cause r although that something might be the wavefunction itself in which case part x be simply the wavefunction note though that we need more than u to explain r anyway i speculate that mind would be in part x there seem to be some link between consciousnes and r in that we never see linear superposition of anything although there be alternative explaination for thi i no idea how a brain be suppose to acces part x but since thi be only speculation that wo matter too much my main point be that there might be a place for mind in physic i go back to my nice pad cell now if that ok with you petrus kevin anthoney kax do believe anything you read in sig file
