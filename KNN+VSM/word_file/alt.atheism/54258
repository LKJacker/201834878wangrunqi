issue of jesu you know not of what you speak here be a few contradiction start with the trial and continue through the assension the death of juda after the betrayal of jesu act now thi man juda purchase a field with the reward of iniquity and fall headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all hi bowel gush out matt and he juda cast down the piece of silver in the temple and depart and go and hang himself and the chief priest buy with them the potter field what wa jesu prediction regard peter denial before the cock crow matthew before the cock crow twice mark how many time do the cock crow mar and the second time the cock crew and peter call to mind the word that jesu say unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice and when he think thereon he weep mat then begin he to curse and to swear say i know not the man and immediately the cock crew mat and peter remember the word of jesu which say unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he go out and weep bitterly luk and peter say man i know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew luk and the lord turn and look upon peter and peter remember the word of the lord how he have say unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice joh jesu answer him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow still thou hast deny me thrice joh peter then deny again and immediately the cock crew destruction of city what say wa jeremiah wa zechariah thi be interest because matthew quote a prophesy that wa never make not the only time he do thi either mat then wa fulfil that which wa speak by jeremy the prophet say and they take the thirty piece of silver the price of him that wa value whom they of the child of israel do value zechariah nothing in jeremiah remotely like what wa the color of the robe place on jesu during hi trial scarlet matthew purple john the time of the crucifiction mark say the third hmy or but john say the sixth hmy noon wa when the sentence wa pass inscription on the cros matthew thi be jesu the king of the jew mark the king of the jew luke thi be the king of the jew john jesu of nazareth the king of the jew what do they give him to drink vinegar matthew wine with myrrh mark woman at the cros matthew say many stand far off include mary magdaline mary the mother of jame and the mother of zebedee child mark and luke speak of many far off and mark include mary magdeline and mary the mother of jame the le john say that jesu mother stand at the cro along with her sister and mary magdalene jesu last word and about the ninth hmy jesu cry with a loud voice say eli eli lama sabachthani that be to say my god my god why hast thou forsake me jesu when he cry again with a loud voice yield u the ghost and when jesu have cry with a loud voice he say father unto thy hand i commend my spirit and have say thu he give up the ghost when jesu therefore have receive the vinegar he say it be finish and he bow hi head and give up the ghost event of the crucifiction matthew say that the veil of the temple wa rent that there wa an earthquake and that it wa dark from the sixth to the ninth hmy that grave open and body of the saint arise and go into jeruselem appear to many beat jesu to the resurection mark and luke speak of darknes and the veil of the temple be rent but mention no earthquake or rise saint john be the only one who mention jesu side be peirced burial of jesu matthew say the jew ask pilate for a guard to prevent the body from be steal by the disciple and for the tomb to be seal all of thi wa supposedly do but the other gospel do not mention these precaution how long wa jesu in the tomb depend where you look matthew gife jesu prophesy that he will spend three day and three night in the heart of the earth and mark ha after three day metum trei emera he will rise again a far a i can see from a quick look the prophecy have after three day but the post-resurrection narrative have on the third day time of the resurection matthew say sunday at dawn mark say the sun wa rise and john say it wa dark who wa at the empty tomb is it mat in the end of the sabbath a it begin to dawn toward the first day of the week come mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre mar and when the sabbath wa past mary magdalene and mary the mother of jame and salome have buy sweet spice that they might come and anoint him joh the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it wa yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone take away from the sepulchre whom do they see at the tomb mat and behold there wa a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descend from heaven and come and roll back the stone from the door and sit upon it mat hi countenance wa like lightning and hi raiment white a snow mat and for fear of him the keeper do shake and become a dead man mat and the angel answer and say unto the woman fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesu which wa crucify mar and enter into the sepulchre they saw a young man sit on the right side clothe in a long white garment and they be affright luk and it come to pa a they be much perplex thereabout behold two man stand by them in shin garment joh and seeth two angel in white sit the one at the head and the other at the foot where the body of jesu have lie belief that the disciple steal jesu body matthew say the guard wa pay to tell thi story but no other gospel make thi claim appearence of the rise jesu matthew say an angel at the tomb tell the two mary and that jesu also tell them to tell the disciple to meet him in galilee the disciple then go to a mountain previously agree opon and meet jesu there thi wa hi only appearance except to the woman at the tomb matthew only devote five verse to the visit with the disciple mark say that jesu walk with two of the disciple in the country and that they tell the rest of the disciple who refuse to believe later he appear to the disciple at mealtime luke say two follower go the same day that jesu rise from the dead to emmau a village eight mile from jeruselem and there jesu jioned them but wa unrecognised while they eat a meal together that even they finally recognise jesu whereopon he dissapeared returning at once to jeruselem they tell the disciple of their experience and suddenly jesu appear among them frighten them a they think he wa a spirit jesu then eat some fish and honey and then preach to them john say jesu appear to the disciple the even of the day he arrose in jeruselem where they be hide he breathe the holy ghost opon them but thoma wa not present and refuse to believe eight day later jesu join the disciple again at the same place and thi time he convince thoma once more jesu make an appearance to the disciple at the sea of tiberia but again wa not recognise after tell them to cast their netson the other side of the boat jesu become know to them and prepare bread and fish for them they all eat together and converse the book of act further add to the confusion it say that jesu show himself to the apostle for a period of day after hi resurection thu contradict matthew mark luke and john and speak to them of thing pertain to the kingdom of god and when he have speak these thing while they behold he wa take up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight and while they look steadfastly toward heaven a he go up two man stand by them in white apparel which also say ye man of galilee why stand ye gaze into heaven thi same jesu which be take from you into heaven shall so comein like mannera ye have see him go into heaven act paul outdo every other authority by say that jesu wa see by person between the time of the resurection and the assension although he do not say where he also claim that he himself a one bear out of due time also saw jesu cor the ascension matthew say nothing about it mark casually say that jesu wa recieved into heaven after he wa finish talk with the disciple in jeruselem luke say jesu lead the desciple to bethany and that while he bless them he wa part from them and carry up into heaven john say nothing about it act contradict all of the above see previou section when second come mat verily i say unto you thi generation shall not pa till all these thing be fulfil mar verily i say unto you that thi generation shall not pa till all these thing be do luk verily i say unto you thi generation shall not pa away till all be fulfil thessalonian how many apostle be in office between the resurection and ascention corinthian matthew minu one from act mathia not elect until after resurrection mat then the eleven disciple go away into galilee into a mountain where jesu have appoint them ascend to heaven and elijah go up by a whirlwind into heaven king no man hath ascend up to heaven but he that come down from heaven the son of man john a you can see there be a number of contradiction in the account of the trial crucifiction and resurection of jesu if these be good witness you would think that they could get some of these important detail right in fact i can not find very many point on where they agree you would think that they could at least agree on some of the point they be supposedly observe because of the fact that there be so much contradiction and error the story of the resurection a present can not be take a literal truth due to the nature of the story i doubt if it should be take a any sort of truth alan
