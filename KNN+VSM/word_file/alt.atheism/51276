from darice fred rice subject re ancient islamic ritual in cfaehl chri faehl write in article darice fred rice write delete to get to the point therefore in a nutshell my opinion be that pre-marital sex make the likelihood of extra-marital sex more probable furthermore in my opinion extra-marital sex help break down partnership and lead to greater divorce rate thi in turn in my opinion create trauma and a le stable environment for child who be then in my opinion more likely to grow up with psychological problem such a depression etc and thu sex outside of marriage be in the long run harmful to society i think that you be draw link where there be none have sex before marriage ha nothing to do with adultery once commit into marriage the issue a i see it be more of how commit you be to not foist pain on ymy spouse and how confident you be about yourself in addition what someone do within their marriage be their own busines not mine and not your i have witness strong relationship that incorporate extra-marital sex i would agree with ymy assertion about child child should not be witnes to such confuse relationship if adultery be stressful to adult which i assume it in general be how can we expect child to understand it where be the evidence for my opinion at the moment there be just generality i can cite for example i read that in the century the percentage of youth and person in general who suffer from depression ha be steadily climb in western society probably what i wa read refer particularly to the usa similarly one can detect a trend toward greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage in thi century in western society particularly with the sexual revolution of the but even before that i think otherwise the sexual revolution of the would not have be possible particularly with the gradual weaken of christianity and consequently christian moral teach against sex outside of marriage i propose that these two trend greater level of general depression in society and other psychological problem and greater sexual promiscuity be link with the latter be a prime cause of the former i can not provide any evidence beyond thi at thi stage but the whole thesi seem very reasonable to me and i request that person ponder upon it why be it more reasonable than the trend toward obesity and the trend toward depression you ca just pick ymy two favorite trend notice a correlation in them and make a sweep statement of generality i mean you can and person have but that do not mean that it be a valid or reasonable thesi at best it a gros oversimplification of the push-pull factor person experience my argument be mainly a proposal of what i think be a plausible argument against extra-marital sex one which i personally believe ha some truth my main purpose for post it here be to show that a plausible argument can be make against extra-marital sex at thi stage i be not say that thi particular viewpoint be prove or anything like that just that it be plausible to try to convince you all of thi particular point of view i would probably have to do a lot of work research what ha be do in thi field etc in order to gather further evidence which i simply do not have time to do now also note that i say that i think extra-marital sex be a prime cause in my opinion of the generally greater level of psychological problem especially depression in western society i be not say it be the prime cause or the only cause just a prime cause one of the significant contribution to thi trend i think when you say you think my view be simplistic you have forget thi i admit that there be probably other factor but i do think that extra-marital sex and imo subsequent destabilization of the family be a significant factor in the rise in psychological problem like depression in western society thi century fred rice darice
