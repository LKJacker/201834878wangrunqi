from mccullou mark mccullough subject re idle question for fellow atheist in article acooper write i wonder how many atheist out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheist be the majority rather than the minority group of the population probably we would have much the same problem with only a slight shift in emphasi weekend might not be so inviolate more common to work day a week in a busines and instead of american atheist we would have similar religiou organization a person religiou belief seem more a a crutch and justification for action than a guide to determine action of course person would have to come up with more fascinate rationalization for their action but that could be fun to watch it seem to me that for most person religion in america do matter that much you have extreemist on both end but a large majority do make too much of an issue about it a long a you do now admittedly i have never have to suffer the bible belt but i be just north of it and see the fringe and the reasonable person in most thing tend to be reasonable in religion a well also how many atheist out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of think over the theistic way of think the typical selfish argument would be that both line of think evolve from the same inherent motivation so one be not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively but then again a measure stick must be draw somewhere and if we can not assign value to a system of belief at it core than the only other alternative be to apply it to it periphery ie how it express it own selfishnes i do bother accord a higher value to my think or just about anybody think i do want to fall in that trap because if you do start that then you be then to decide which be better say whom why be there a best and also what to do about those who have inferior mode of think idic infinite diversity in infinite combination i argue it over a soda but not over much more just my what inflation ha do
