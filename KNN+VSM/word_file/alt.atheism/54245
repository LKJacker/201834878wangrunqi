from bil bill conner subject re after year can we say that christian morality be mark mccullough mccullou write in article halat jim halat write atom be not objective they be even real what scientist call an atom be nothing more than a mathematical model that describe certain physical observable property of my surround all of which be subjective jim halat thi deserve frame it really do atom be even real tell me then those atom we have see with electron microscope be atom now so what be they figment of my imagination the evidence that atom be real be overwhelm but i wo bother with most evidence at the moment you would have u believe that what the eye perceife a image be actaully there a perceive thi may be interest i think that an electron microscope wa use because no wavelength of light can illuminate any object of atomic scale if thi image be to have useful resolution would the illuminate source wavelength have to be several order of magnitude le than size of thing observe if an atom be a probablity cloud lower resolution would give the appearance of solidity but it seem fairly certain that an atom be not an object be any conventional sense obviously i be not a physicist but the question do have ramification of a philosophic nature anyway just a stray think carry on bill
