from keith keith allan schneider subject re political atheist bobbe robert beauchaine write i think that about or so person approve of the death penalty even realize all of it shortcoming do thi make it reasonable or be you the sole judge of reasonability aside from revenge what merit do you find in capital punishment are we talk about me or the majority of the person that support it anyway i think that revenge or fairnes be why most person be in favor of the punishment if a murderer be go to be punish person that think that he should get what he deserve most person would think it would be fair for the murderer to live while hi victim die revenge petty and pathetic perhap you think that it be petty and pathetic but ymy view be in the minority we have a local televise hot topic talk show that very recently do a segment on capital punishment each and every advocate of the use of thi portion of my system of jurisprudence cite the main reason for support it that bastard deserve it true human compassion forgivenes and sympathy where be we require to have compassion forgivenes and sympathy if someone wrong me i will take great length to make sure that hi advantage be remove or a similar situation be force upon him if someone kill another then we can apply the golden rule and kill thi person in turn is not my entire moral system base on such a concept or be you state that human life be sacred somehow and that it should never be violate thi would sound like some sort of religiou view i mean how reasonable be imprisonment really when you think about it sure the person could be release if find innocent but you still ca undo the imiprisonment that wa serve perhap we should imprision person if we could watch them closely instead the cost would probably be similar especially if we just implant some sort of electronic device would you rather be alive in prison or dead in the chair once a criminal ha commit a murder hi desire be irrelevant and you still have not answer my question if you be concern about the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent then why be thi same concern share with imprisonment should we by ymy logic administer a minimum a punishment a possible to avoid violate the liberty or happiness of an innocent person keith
