from matt matt freivald subject re good neighbor political hypocrisy test in article wdstarr william december starr write omit from the distribution line because my site news post software do believe in it and refuse to try to post to it i sure hope that matt also read either or saw it in thank in article matt matt freivald say i like to call the form of government that i advocate fractal federalism with fractal federalism there be a representative national government that ha only certain limit power to do what be absolutely necessary at that level next there be the state government again with only absolutely necessary power onward to county district and neighborhood the lowest read most local level be the one that have the most power over individual day-to-day life which be good because that be the level where individual have the most voice you know if you take all thi to it logical conclusion do it seem that the real lowest level the level where individual have the most voice be that of the single individual themself why have you omit that level from ymy model ye and the individual be not omit i just do fully articulate the principle of fractal federalism all government power derive from the person each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment proces where a true consensu say a majority write that power into the constitution of the level above in the case of the lowest level an amendement be pass by a majority vote in the case of higher level it must be pass by of the legislature we can of course haggle about the specific of true consensu when we hold my constitutional convention once a power ha be grant it may be exercise by the legislature power not in the original constitution must percolate upward start from the individual the ratification proces for the original constitution should involve consensu and not simply a plurality or majority granting a right in a constitution be of course the same a empower the government at that level to restrict the activity of the government at the lower level so it operate in the same way a the amendment proces again that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual government structure thi government structure be a very frustrate one for those person read liberal who would like to have concentrate power to use the government to force person to do good a difficult-to-define word and one that it be difficult to reach a consensu on it be also a frustrate structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior read big-government conservative i personally would rather see those type of person frustrate than the incredible erosion of liberty both civil and economic that be go on now thi be imho a good government stucture for those who see the role of government a the protection of individual liberty while still recognize that individual need to have some influence in the type of community that they live in a free market work on government not just economic succesful idea propogate unsuccessful idea die what be ymy definition of a successful idea or a successful government one which maintain peace liberty and the opportunity for happiness for it person while work within the reality of human nature you do bring up the point intentional or not that a last idea be by no mean necessarily a successful idea i believe that fractal federalism would at least bring many idea to light and the person would have the opportunity to democratically choose between good idea and bad idea if the docialist er i mean democrat be right and government activism foster a prosperou person they will have a plethora of local opportunity to check their thesi if libertopium be possible it will arise if a balance conservative republic be democratically receive a the best level of government activity it will become clear to the person that it be best a far a set the moral tone be concern if a community do not collectively want to put up with prostitution go on in front of their kid why should they have to if a community do not want to see proliferation of drug among their kid why should they have to for the same reason that they have to put up with a church operate right out in the open where their kid can see it and with the owner of the house acros the street fly an american flag right out there in the open every day in front of their kid it call freedom if they do like the idea to which their kid be expose they can try to educate and persuade their kid a to why the thing that they see other person do be wrong or bad right and person would not rescind any freedom read empower the government except through the amendment proces that be how the federal government be suppose to work now but the supreme soviet er i mean the supreme court put a stop to that republican government nonsense in my hypothetical government if there be a constitutional provision empower the government to regulate church the government whatever level we be talk about could indeed ban church the constitutional provision would be invalid if a higher level have a constitutional provision protect free exercise of religion the uppermost constitution be still the supreme law of the land i find it interest that you applaud the idea of free-market competition among variou idea and yet support the right of he majority in a community to suppres idea which they do like it be a matter of individual be able to control their own association and environment not a matter of suppression of idea one dilemma of the human condition be that individual need liberty and they also need to have some control over their environment in my fractal federalism government certain right be protect by the constitution other right be protect simply because the government ha not be empower to infringe upon them when a consensu be reach that the government should have a certain power then freedom be infringe upon thi can not be avoid murder statute infringe upon freedom but i think that the consensu of the american person be that murder statute be a good idea i be sure that many parent believe that they have a right to control the environment that their child live in person feel that they have a right to sleep peacefully at night thu there be noise ordinance there be zone law that keep business from overrun residential neighborhood i do not view these a bad thing certainly some individual instance be bad but the concept be not necessarily bad i view them a the person in a community have some control over the type of community that they live in i see the alternative a near anarchy like i say in another post if you can come up with a scenario where an individual can do something truly autonomously with absolutely zero effect on anyone else then no individual or government ha the right to restrict that activity there be simply not very many behavior that fit into the category of the truly autonomou so the whole thing become an issue of one individual or group have power over another individual or group i think that the fractal federalism approach be a sound if not ideal approach to limit thi restrictive power the libertarian scenario degenerate to might make right and the system we have right now be one of lawyer abuse natural right philosophy to decide what power the government should have by subvert the democratic proces though the supreme court the problem with the egalitarian view be that it try to deny the fundamental dilemma of democratic government the person have a right to exercise a voice in their community yet individual have the right to be leave to themself thi be a seriou dilemma precisely because there be not much that take place in a vacuum oddly enough if what you say be take literally there be little or no conflict the person do indeed have a right to exercise a voice where voice equal persuasive speech in their community it only when they somehow get the idea into their head that they also have a right to dictate behavior in their community that the trouble begin i think i answer thi above already but let me expand a little more with an example if i stand naked in front of ymy house and masturbate in front of ymy child while they play in ymy libertarian small scenario the only recourse you have be to yell at me autonomou be a value judgement of the time it be not a scientific reality with a clear definition exactly who would you empower to make that value judgement stuff delete certainly not the only cause mike but person in a local neighborhood should have a voice in what go on in that neighborhood to deny thi be to create another concentrate centralize power to keep the locality from abuse it power in essence use a pit bull to keep a toy poodle from bite ymy leg chance be the pit bull be go to turn on you some day and you have much le defense against it than you do against the toy poodle the argument here appear to be that tyranny of the individual by the local majority be superior to have the federal government have and exercise the power to protect the individual from hi neighbor because that federal government will eventually and inevitably become corrupt and use it power to tyrannize everyone okay there a lot of truth in that certainly we see something like that happen in the united state today though it unclear that he progression here match the model since my beloved and benign federal government ha much enthusiasm for the idea of protect any individual lot of person be long on complaint and short on practical solution although i be pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit i be at least try to be long on solution also i be truly interest if you have any improvement to make on my idea i call them my idea but they all come from an average guy read of the constitution without benefit of the indoctrination of constitutional law academium but i have to say that i think that ymy solution be at least just a bad trading the yoke of federal tyranny for the yoke of local tyranny do cheer me up much i think i prefer to put my faith in a larger government that at least might protect the individual from time to time rather than place it in local mob rule admittedly it the lesser of two evil and it not le by very much and they both pretty damn evil sorry the confusion wa my fault when i say that fractal federalism resemble the constitution i mean it and think it wa pretty clear i should have more clearly explain that the ultimate derivation of government power be from the consensu of the person although not the consent of every individual a practical observation not a moral judgement it be certainly better than have all government power derive from nine lawyer which be the situation we have now that be why i think the supreme court should be a jury court with a different jury for each case it be certainly not perfect no philosophy of government be but do you still find it a repugnant idea if so what be ymy solution ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary thi will never work because person be different and by their nature they will alway want to force their view on other if thi be not the case nobody would try to force their view that murder be wrong on anyone else thi be true the question be what we you go to do about it ymy propose solution seem to actually encourage these bozo to lord it over their victim i think that you misunderstand the structure of the form of government i advocate and it wa my fault for not be more clear oh and by the way liborgalism thinking is irrelevant integrity is irrelevant free speech is irrelevant private property is irrelevant personal responsibility is irrelevant conservativism is futile you will be assimilated how much would freedom of speech or private property right be respect in a community in which the majority wa allow to make all the rule that man say thing in public that i do want my child expose to let shut him up those homo be live together and fornicate in that house over there let run outtum town the majority do not make the rule the majority or possibly a plurality simply elect representative to exercise limit government power those limit government power derive from a large consensu not a simple majority and the federal government in my scenario still ha the power to protect freedom william december starr wdstarr matt freivald liborgalism thinking is irrelevant integrity is irrelevant free speech is irrelevant private property is irrelevant personal responsibility is irrelevant conservativism is futile you will be assimilated these are my opinion only and not those of my employer
