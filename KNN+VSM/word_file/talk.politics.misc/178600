from techie william a bacon subject some scientist do not believe in the green house effect the follow statement wa release on february by the science environmental policy project a independent scientist research atmosphere and climate problem we be concern by the agenda for unced the united nation conference on environment and development be develop by environmental and activist group and certain political leader thi so call earth summit be schedule to convene in brazil in june and aim to impose a system of global envionmental regulation include onerou taxe on energy fuel on the population of the united state and other industrialize nation such policy initiative derive from highly uncetain scientific theory they be base on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warm follow from the burn of fossill fuel and require immediate action we do not agree a survey of atmospheric scientist conduct in the summer of confirm that there be no consesensu about the cause of the slight warm observe during the past century a recently publish research paper even suggest sunspot variability which be directly proportional to solar activity rather than a rise in greenhouse gas be responsible for the global temperature increase and decrease recode since about futhermore the majority of scientific participant in the survey agree that the theoretical climate climate model use to predict a future warm can not be rely upon and be not validate by the exist climate record yet all prediction be base on such theoretical model finally agriculturalit generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide level from fossil fuel burn ha beneficial effect on most crop and on world food supply we be disturb that activist anxiou to stop energy and economic growth be push ahead with drastic policy without take notice of recent change in the underlie science we fear that the rush to impose global regulation will have catastrophic impact on the world economy on job standard of
