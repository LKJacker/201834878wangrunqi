from david veal subject re re fillibuster in article hallam phill hallam-baker write in article veal david veal write if the senate wa le powerful than the house of lord than we almost have to state that the house of representative wa also in fact they both be because the british government have much greater power than do the american system in principle no in practice ye in principle no that they have le power of that they should have have le power the british parliament in principle ha absolute power so do the monarch much of the stability of the system rest on what be not define clearly in the case of a clear abuse by one side or the other the other side can act to remedy the situation two institution with absolute power cute let talk practicality shall we if the monarch try to do something what would happen if they be to start from a social welfare model instead of the current no state subsidy motto they would be better place a it be there be plenty of state money be hand out the problem be that it be distribute on the basi of power in congres and not on the basi of actual need bingo the higher up the governmental ladder the le actual need matter because political power can be concentrate at higher level while person with le cloud only find themself reduce to in effectivenes that wa not my point but you illustrate the problem very well in order to set up a school project in new york state you have to pay off the other state with pork defense contract agricultural subsidy etc or to be precise of the state since you need to beat the filibuster then why not simply leave new york education to new york i remain unconcinved that there be any state in the union which be not capable of educate it own child if that what they want to do the point be of redistribution of cash from the poor area of the ecconomy to the rich one i be contend that there be no state in the union which do not have ample wealth if they choose to spend it to run a perfectly acceptable education system i further contend that the amount of money be spend now be more then sufficient but be be spend badly or vice versa if you be a republican so tell me phill were the republican also responsible for some of the huge increase in social program or be they only responsible for what you do like i contend it be congres which be to blame democrat and republican alike if society simply write off any area of the country that be ecconomically weak you end up with a basket case ecconomy there be inevitable cycle in any busines some of these act in phase to produce the busines cycle other be countercyclic locality can experience boom to bust cycle outside the national trend to produce a strong ecconomy you need to ensure that the bust area do not fall bellow the level where they can not be ecconomically rebuild most of my worst area be still better off than most of europe in any case we talk about education if the industry in an area collapse the u a a whole still ha a responsibility to ensure that the child in that area get a good education in some area of the u school be close halfway through the year for lack of money ye i live in once such area you woefully ignorant of the situation at the same time some of tennessee school district be close down the governor ask for million dollar for bicentenntial celebration license plat in almost the same breath he want to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxe which pay into it i do know about the rest of the country but my education problem stem directly from two problem neither of which be a lack of money in the state btw tennessee be consider a tax heaven and my economy be one of the strongest in the country i see a correlation what money we spend go primarly to administration the average administrator make two and a half time what the average teacher make and suck up an enormou amount of revenue and the governor be make a concert effort to create an education crisi in order to push for hi pet income tax some of the most idiotic program get fund like state fund for new art in the county seat while school be close it not a lack of fund it an unwillingnes to spend them on what be more appropriate education be the parental hot-button education be alway the first to but cut because it easier to get person to pay for their child than ugly art the constitution be a nuts-and-bolt document the delcaration of independence wa the high-brow reason there be a couple of other example though such a the reason for the power to tax and the reason for the power to grant permit both in article i section the declaration on independence cam a decade earlier and ha not a line of justification for the u constitution you could argue that it go into the broad concept but little more it speak very eloquently on government be base on the consent of the govern in fact it be little more than a protract whinge more to do with the price of tea than the design of a government it would be a pretty daft idea for a bunch of guy to sit arround design the structure of the new government while the little matter of the british army remain to be settle they do it anyway the continental congres have it own set of bylaw it wa quite a government but a mean of make decision have to be create however low george washington opinion of them be to a certain extend i do believe the veto ha become something it wa intend however i also believe it be inevitable consider the congres own abuse of their power to make bill say whatever they want them to say unlike most person i think we should be worry about the veto which be fine but of the problem in congres which almost necessitate it abuse the congres be the most democratic body in the whole system allow me again to speak heresy against the holy democratic order so what the government wa build with a very non-democratic presidency with fairly broad power include the veto it ha not only the fairest system of election but the two year term mean that the member have alway get a recent mandate ye and the senate wa intend to act a a balance to thi too much democracy wa intentionally avoid it wa consider a good thing to place non-democratic block to impulsive action on the other hand if the period of election be to be make year in antiphase to the presidential cycle there would be much le dependence on fund raise from special interest than there be at present so long a congres ha something to sell person will pay for it most congressman rake in more money than they need why not what be inherently wrong with bias the system against action historically governemnt action in the when deal with issue with a bare minority and a large minority have not be successful when you in a position of impose federal power on diverse person why should the federal government not have to get through something more than a bare majority in other word david think that the reactionary should need only vote while progressive should need no if the progressive do want the reactionary to move backward they get the same benefit of the state be a lot of person and historically law with that sort of minority arent very effective especially since it be usually geographically concentrate when wield the federal big stick i do see why they should have to make a better argument than more person than not agree now we know why nobody call the republican democrat i not a republican i a republican and no i neither a democrat nor a democrat now i ask several time and all you do be answer it be democratic which i know before i say it why should it be democratic we do have a true direct democracy and few person advocate one why then be thi other modification of democracy to bia it against action so much worse david veal univ of tenn div of cont education info service group i still remember the way you laugh the day ymy push me down the elevator shaft i begin to think you do love me anymore weird al
