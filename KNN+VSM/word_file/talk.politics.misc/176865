from steveh steve hendrick subject re price control for medical care wa re we from the govt in article slagle write in article steveh steve hendrick write thank to kim for follow up i wa hop that someone would bring up the issue of cost compensation the problem with the argument be that it fail to explain why kidney dialysi rd service have expand massively in the last decade after all no one be force private provider to offer thi service if they be lose money on the treatment which accord to information i collect from several provider they be not why would they not simply limit their loss by cut back on service engage in effective ration of supply rather than expand the coverage to a larger market that must then be compensate by raise price in other area perhap there be a competitive advantage in there after all would not reputable and dedicate physician prefer to affiliate with an institution that offer dialysi service would they not therefore tend to admit patient in greater number to an institution that offer a full range of diagnostic and treatment option undoubtedly in fact it be the fact that hospital frequently compete for physician rather than for patient that in part complicate and undermine a simplistic free-market analysi of the market for medical care hospital tend to lose money on all sort of high-tech high-price machinery they manage to make it up on other charge once again there be no evidence that thi be true in regard to kidney dialysi although price control have promote an expansion of service to a much greater volume of patient rd be still a profitable service otherwise one would expect to see evidence of ration rather than the vast expansion that ha occur remember the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but make it up in volume be not good economic even in a free market then how do you explain why grocery store routinely offer an array of product at price below cost are not grocery store embed in a relatively free market can you spell los leader i know you could grocery store do not attempt to make up the los on an individual product by sell more of it in fact ymy argument above be that kidney dialysi be a los leader for other medical treatment where lose revenue can be regain but the evidence do not support thi contention rather it appear that price control have discipline the market by force an expansion of service and development of improve lower-cost technology to provide comparable benefit provider continue to profit from rd they simply make le on each treatment than they would have if the price have rise at the rate that uncontrolled treatment have there be no question that have price control force the price of rd substantially below it actual cost that some or all of the doomsday prediction of free-market advocate would have be see restriction of service lag technological development etc likewise it appear that in the va and arm force medical care system where provider be government agency some of these negative impact may occur rd patient in the va system in spokane for example must travel to seattle mile away for treatment the bottom line however be that thi be an example of government intervention of a rather extreme sort that appear to have have beneficial result for both provider and consumer claim that government bureaucracy inevitably lead to undesirable outcome in the marketplace should take such such case into account jsh mark steve hendrick domain steveh one thing about datum it sure do cut uucp uunet isc-br thor steveh the r hofferbert ma bell
