from wdstarr william december starr subject re law and economic i go to be mix together here stuff from two of ted frank article which wa a response to me and a response to tim smith ye i know the boomer court do call it eminent domain but if it walk like eminent domain and swim like eminent domain and quack like eminent domain wdstarr are all tort case really eminent domain case then what about bankruptcy contract eminent domain be a state-mandated transaction in which one party be require to sell a piece of property which it own to another party regardles of whether the first party wish to sell at all at a price which be set by the state i fail to see how thi doctrine can be find in tort bankruptcy or contract case in general well okay sort of in bankruptcy if so so what since when be the court suppose to be in the busines of prevent party from reap windfall settlement from other party when those settlement arise from wrongful act by those other party wdstarr since you say that boomer reliance on economic lead to an unjust result i point out that ymy alternative be far more unjust in the traditional sense of the world atlantic cement act wa not wrongful it do something that we a a capitalistic society should want them to do build a factory create industry and job the cost of compliance wa grossly disproportionate to the damage face by plaintiff bang here one of the place where we widely diverge you believe that the court in decide a civil dispute between two party should consider a a factor perhap a an override factor issue which i believe the court should ignore a be irrelevant to the dispute boomer v atlantic cement co wa an action bring by one party boomer whose property right be be violate on an ongoing basi by another party the atlantic cement company the fact support boomer contention that atlantic cement wa wrongfully damage hi property and boomer ask the court to order atlantic cement to stop do so end of story there wa no reason for the court to consider such issue a what a capitalistic society would want atlantic cement to do or whether the cost of compliance wa disproportionate to the damage face by the plaintiff those issue have nothing to do with the case before the court bill if the government have step in and the epa make a regulation require multi-million dollar cement plant to be shut down because of a smatter of cement dust at a cost-benefit ratio of you be up in arm why be it okay for the judicial branch to interfere thi way but not the legislative or executive branch i be up in arm why do you assume that quite the contrary i probably support the action since it would be base on the same general doctrine a the decision that i believe would have be correct in boomer the idea that person property right should not be violate for reason of economic efficiency in boomer it wa boomer property right which i believe the court should have protect in the hypothetical epa rule you present it the american person collective property right in a healthy physical environment what good be cost-benefit ratio of if you wind up with cement dust in ymy air ymy rule make it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant if the state of massachusett come up with a similar regulation you be up in arm and complain about interference with property right and fifth amendment violation once again why be it okay for the judicial branch to interfere thi way but not the legislative or executive branch or be you not the libertarian you present yourself a be ted frank how would it be per se illegal to operate a cement plant would it just mean that when buy land for a cement plant you would have to either buy enough land so that most of the pollution would stay on ymy land or buy pollution easement from the surround landowner tim smith all it take be one holdout out of hundred of neighbor to scrap the plant furthermore each of the neighbor be go to want the full benefit of the bargain under the result bilateral monopoly a bonanza for lawyer to be sure who get to negotiate each of these agreement a windfall for homeowner who can extort away any profit the plant would make but not particularly good for society ye so what the court be suppose to protect the specific right of individual not the general interest of some nebulou society if society can have it cement plant without violate anyone right fine otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one le cement plant see ted i really be a libertarian after all that the whole point behind the coase theorem in a world without transaction cost the land will automatically be put to the best use a it be transfer from person to person instantaneously without friction the legal regime will not matter because the result will be the same in a world such a our one with transaction cost one want the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with in order to minimize the transaction cost one want the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with in order to minimize the transaction cost which one be you speak of i want the legal regime to protect person right beside coase theorem only ha real application in the never-never land of perfectly rational actor in the real world some person be go to be stubborn ornery spiteful or otherwise irrational from a economic point of view and the purpose of the court be to protect their right to be so i do care if you can show me logically that ymy cattle be only do of damage to my property per head so i should rationally sell you graze right to my land for say per head i still retain the right to tell you that i just plain do want any damn cattle on my property not at any price and then you say everyone property right be protect the plaintiff be make whole unnecessary settlement cost be avoid a above i dispute ymy claim that the plaintiff be make whole they be in fact by court action deprive of their right a owner of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them wdstarr then by ymy argument no tort plaintiff be ever make whole because the award of damage in involuntary why should we treat a nuisance plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff we do require specific performance in the analogou contractual situation why in tort last question first for the same reason a in contract law because to do so would come dangerously close to tread on the thirteenth amendment a to ymy then by ymy argument no tort plaintiff be ever make whole because the award of damage in involuntary claim you at least partially right faced with situation in which the wrong ha already be do and the damage to the victim ha already take place and can not be reverse or undo court will try to set an equitable price tag on the los suffer by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay thi price rather than an inflate price which the victim might prefer in these case the sale ha already take place and be irreversible and the court simply try to ensure that a fair price be pay under the doctrine that a only in certain circumstance should even a civil wrongdoer be force to pay punitive or excessive price and b even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from hi victimhood both of these doctrine may be worth discuss or debate elsewhere but neither be relevant to case like boomer in which the wrongful act and the los stem from it be still in the future and can be prevent from happen at all by order of the court in these type of case all the court ha to do be require that the potential victim property right be protect until and unles he agree to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price there be no need for the court to gues at the equitable value of the los and force both side to accept it find it can leave that operation up to the party themself and again i ask since when be the court suppose to be in the busines of ensure that unnecessary settlement cost be avoid if so i be miseducated i alway think that the court be suppose to be in the busines of ensure that justice be do unnecessary settlement cost be unjust because they be punitive in case like boomer they simply a cost of do busines the fact that the proprietor of the atlantic cement co get themself into a position in which they find themself over thi barrel be simply a result of their own poor busines decision to start up a cement plant without first try to negotiate with boomer and everyone else whose property right they be violate vium the operation of their plant there nothing punitive or unjust about it it be completely sensible only if you believe that the allege right of the owner of atlantic cement to stay in busines and avoid lose a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and the allege right of several hundred atlantic cement employee to not have their job disappear should trump the right of person who own property which wa damage by atlantic cement wrongful act wdstarr anybody who ever commit a wrongful act should disgorge their entire set of possession to wrong person were you complain about exces punitive damage before anybody who want to commit a wrongful act in the future should be require to buy the right to do so from the victim in advance and the seller should be allow to set hi or her price for the privilege no injustice no punitive damage you like posner bill he a libertarian really i do know that what if anything ha he have to say about case like boomer wdstarr in eal he cite it a an example of bilateral monopoly that the court correctly avoid i sure it cover in the lande and posner book on tort law presumably favorably but i do have that book in front of me do sound very much like a libertarian to me libertarian tend to believe in the right of individual person not society i admit that my understand of the field generally refer to a law and economic be weak if it advocate the use of economical analysi a one of many tie-breaker factor which court may use to help them reach decision in case in which the dispute a measure by the scale of justice be evenly balance fine but a illustrate by boomer it be not fine when the court start view the economic of a case a be more important than the justice of a case wdstarr in thi case the justice of the case wa intricately tie up with the economic of the case atlantic cement commit a tort cause of damage should it pay in the million or just compensate for the damage it commit a state above the tort wa ongoing atlantic cement want to be able to continue to violate boomer right while the court may have be justify in set an equitable price tag on the damage already commit it have no reason and no need to set a price tag on the future violation of boomer right and to then force boomer to sell at that price william december starr wdstarr
