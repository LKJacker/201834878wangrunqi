from kebarne subject re drug and crime a new approach mwilson mark wilson write miss the entire point of my post kebarne write given that the trade in illegal drug be responsible for much of the crime which afflict my nation there be much evidence that it be the fact that the drug be illegal not the drug themself that have cause the violence witnes prohibition and the violence that surround the trade in alcohol no joke person who want drug particularly person who be predispose to addiction will find a way to get them whether or not they be legally available thi be suppossed to be an argument for keep drug illegal no it actually an argument a to how to accomplish the societal good of discourage drug use without violate individual right despite current law enforcement effort drug be readily available to those who want them thi be suppossed to be an argument for keep drug illegal no the point the point be the war on drug be a failure and be counterproductive addiction to drug boh legal and illegal be responsible for a significant drain on the productive resource of my country and thi occur in a variety of way from the cocaine-addicted baby who be unable to learn to the spread of disease among addict to the tragic consequence of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoke the crack baby scenario ha be thouroughly discredit it just so happen that the symptom see in the crack baby be identical to fetal alcohol syndrome and the mother who admit to take crack also admit to drink heavily during pregnancy in thi country person be free to be stupid if they want to but they be not free to be stupid and injure other person admittedly the fetal right-to-life be outside the scope of thi discussion however it ridiculou to assert a you apparently do that cocaine the develop fetal nervou system caffiene and nicotine have fetal effect too why should cocaine be any exception a general economic principle of government be that whatever be subsidize you get more of and whatever be tax you get le of to be most effective in confront the nation drug problem some way must be find to utilize these additional power of government to make drug deal and drug use le attractive so make the drug legal tax them and use the tax money to fund a program to tell person how studid drug be it ha work for the legal drug if you have read my article before write ymy knee-jerk response you would have see that thi be exactly what i advocate while thi country current effort to combat legal drug have succeed in some respect there be a greater awarenes of the health consequence of smoke and designated-driver program have help reduce drink drive for example the same can not be say for the war on illegal drug there remain a core group of illegal drug user which support international network of smuggler pusher grower processor kingpin and gangster these network and their market activity which include drive by shoot corrupt law enforcement authority and smuggle weapon be directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crime commit in my country every day each and every one of these problem be a direct result of the drug trade be illegal no shit sherlock clearly illegal drug and rise crime be link it take only a moment reflection to recognize how they be link the link be money a with thi country fail effort to prohibit alcohol consumption a black market ha be create in which greedy local monopoly like the gangster of a bygone era have profit enormously from their illegal trade the victim of thi trade include not only the innocent person unfortunate enough to be catch in the crossfire but i would argue the drug user themself a great argument for make drug legal thank you how could you have miss the point so utterly be smoke here then be my proposal possession and use of all presently illegal drug be decriminalize but buy and sell them remain illegal can grow their own marijuana a many already do today other drug user can legally import their poison of choice a long a they pay the tariff and a barter economy of drug experimenter develop ymy solution ha do nothing to eliminate the violence in the drug trade btw how be someone go to import a drug if buy it be illegal i think you need to think ymy solution through a little more thouroughly obviously importer will not be buy drug in the under jurisdiction use ymy remain brain cell because of the barter economy which supply the drug user the black market profit that have so enrich the drug lord dwindle if these drug can be obtain for or next to nothing why buy them nevertheles there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommercial drug even at relatively low price therefore you have fail to indicate how these drug can be obtain for free or next to nothing you have state that the sale of them be illegal i spell it out for you barter economy mean that drug user will be permit to grow or synthesize chemically anything they choose or to buy it outside the and bring it in if it wo grow here they will also be permit to trade with other drug user for drug other than the one they themself grow or manufacture they will not however be able to legally sell their drug for money both manufacture and importation of noncommercial drug will be tax to discourage their use thi be ymy brain on drug any question law enforcement activity be concentrate on those individual who continue to buy and sell and also on the crime commit by drug user too poor to afford even low price but here be where the strategy begin to differentiate between the drug dealer the victimizer and the drug user their victim in most city thi be already the strategy it ha already fail and be drag the rest of u down with it pardon me but of these drug be still a crime you can not analogize the rate at which drug user would seek treatment and the comparative ease with which it could be make available today when these drug be illegal to with what it would be be to decriminalizing possession and use make drug dealer be exploit the weakness of those person who be prone to addiction and a such the drug user should be leave alone not throw in prison along with their victimizer the criminal and should be treat a such drug addiction do not absolve you of responsiblity for ymy criminal action however upon arrest suspect be permit to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test those who choose to cooperate be inform that upon conviction for the crime they be accuse of if they be find to be a drug user they will be institutionalize until they be clean and only then will they begin to serve their sentence if they choose to cooperate and be already drug-free they can begin to serve their sentence right away those who choose not to undergo the drug test and be convict face stiffer fine and serve longer sentence thi sound a hell of a lot like self incrimination which be unconstitutional if drug use be legal in ymy scheme why should the presence of drug in anyone system influence the penalty they receive much too big brotherish for my taste the drug test of an arrest suspect be voluntary not coerce and do not therefore constitute violation of amendment v those convict who be drug user a evidence by the test be in need of treatment for their problem institutionalization of these adddicted criminal be i would argue the best way to help them straighten out if they refuse the test and be convict their sentence can be appropriately harsher since they unlike the addict have no excuse for their crime institutionalization of drug use criminal serve several purpose drug use criminal and thi include drink driver be separate from their source of supply thu reduce the total number of drug user in society at large and consequently decrease the demand for drug on the street put more of the remain drug dealer out of busines why should drug use criminal be treat any different from other criminal you have already state that drug use be legal why not my objective be to discourage drug behavior if fewer criminal do drug out of fear of get a harsher sentence if they be convict why be that not a good thing if fewer drug dealer who be still criminal btw can find victim why be that not a good thing if fewer drug user such a drink etc commit crime out of fear of be cut off from their source of supply why be that not a good thing i certainly will to debate my position you have to read it carefully though standard disclaimer x dna ken barne lifescus bldg conservative libertarian kebarne for pro-balance memphi i find
