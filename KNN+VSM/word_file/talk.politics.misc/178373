from hallam phill hallam-baker subject the lesson of the nazi re david irving scholastic fraud in respond to the post below i have consider issue far outside the scope of revisionism and principally have consider the political implication of a racist ideology and it inevitable outcome thu it be tangentially relevant to and but i have direct followup to since it be principally consideration of the political lesson to be draw from the history of the nazi party that i deal with in article kmcvay ken mcvay write a dawidowicz point out in the holocaust and the historian harvard university pres the nadir in hitlerology be reach by david irving hitler war an amateur historian whose reputation a a german apologist and a a writer without regard for accuracy or truth win him a measure of notoriety irving produce a work intend to show that hitler wa kind to hi animal and to hi secretary that he wa probably the weakest leader germany ha know in thi century and that he do not murder the jew or even wish to do so but that the murder wa commit behind hi back without hi knowledge or consent let u assume for the sake of argument that thi wa indeed the case do thi mean that hilter would have be in any way le guilty of ma murder because he aquiesced rather than participate a an active and ardent supporter one of the important thing to realise about the nazi be that the system wa far more evil than any single member once create the nazi party itself wa a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide there wa noone within it strong enough to prevent it remember that hitler do not originaly lead the nazi party nor wa he particularly powerful within it until hi oratory allow the party to come to power had hitler renege upon the emotiaonal expectation which he have create within the rank of hi supporter he would have be replace a he have himself replace the old guard who he beleived be unable to grasp the intellectual implication of their rhetoric thi be why all party that espouse nazi style race supremacy ideology must be consider a dangerou and a evil a the nazi the idea that one race of person be inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity be to achieve racial perfection ha only one logical outcome the ga chamber of auschwitz the nazi party be not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray beyond the evil of individual there wa the evil of the system itself which wa self generate and self perpetuate hitler wa an extreemly evil person who build hi party arround an ego cult center on the demonstration of hi own power thi do not however mean that he wa a entirely free from political constraint a he and hi propagandist work so hard to assert the myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nation ill must be emphatically reject in the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrate it strength and one that be able to govern decisively in the manner it beleife be best i would accept only the latter a a strong government since most display of strength be make necessary by an essential weaknes it be important to understand that the nazi be not stupid nor be they amoral in the sense that they lack moral scruple they act in the same manner a the spanish inquisition murder and torture in the cause of morality the fault of the nazi ly in their axiom not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axiom thu all such party such a the national front or david duke klu klux klan front who assert the truth of those axiom must be consider for what they be advocate of a system that would commit genocide the conclusion that hitler wa not only responsible but imensely evil be inescapable from the historical record it be important though to not let the conclusion be reach that the nazi espouse a set of idea that be basically correct but have an unfortunate proponent the evil of the concept of race supremacy be primary although thi most emphaticaly do not excuse individual culpability thi be nevertheles secondary no matter what the promise make by a racist supremacist party upon election those promise will be break a soon a circumstance permit if thi require the replacement of the leader that originally make the pledge that will occur hatred be a supreme justifier it also create a dynamic of it own when those in government allow it reign for many in government politic be a method of provide a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance a rhetoric of hatred inevitably develop the question of action since the continue existence of an object of hatred be inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician thu we have the u raid on tripoli which ha little purpose beyond a demonstration of power it be important to realise that there be no quantum jump between the politic of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action be take on the basi of that predjudice in the same way the extreeme leave trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology it be important though that in attempt to understand the dynamic of political system that thi be not use to excuse the participant the leader of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily be require to stive to do so thu to take on such a task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of one set of axiom to it conclusion in itself be a moral crime furthermore in take on such a duty one be oblige to put the interest of the whole before personal concern even of personal security although it wa inevitable that a party such a the nazi base upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbol of power should have saught to commit genocide it wa not inevitable that they should succeed each member of the system have an ability to create a change within it that have a possibility of change the dynamic realising that the individual can not hope to control a system do not mean accept that the individual can not affect the system
