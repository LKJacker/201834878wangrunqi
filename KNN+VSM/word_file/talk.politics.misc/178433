from gld gary l dare subject re eight myth about national health insurance pt ius daniel b case write gld gary l dare write the difference in the litigation environment be reflect in the fee lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice be really why we spend le use the most expensive approach of pure insurance and maybe that not such a good thing i also read somewhere that it be next to impossible in canada to litigate against the health system-clas action suit be nearly impossible and you ca sue the provincial health official at all since my doctor be private and the system be just an insurance plan litigation would not involve the insurance fund my lawyer do not work on contingency so that if you be to sue for malpractice then you better be sure of win to cover ymy fee likewise if you be a doctor and subject of a suit it time to sweat since the provincial wing of the cma be the one that go to bat when the fee schedule hike be present the politically-bent doctor be just cackle when they realize the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialize medicine approach like britain national health service oh no do let the ama know about thi they have enough power a it be ask most american whether they like the doctor lobby to get more powerful a few week ago the president of the canadian ma write a letter to the nyt to decry a lobbyist advert repeat the same old trash thi be significant because the ama and the cma be interlink organization and he would not have do it without the approval of hi ama crony well yeah tell u about the national defense medical centre outside ottawa theoretically it limit to service personnel but some study i hear about have suggest that about half the patient there be civilian who not only have connection but be urgent at all it serve the same purpose a the bethesda naval hospital since not all hospital can provide everything maybe they have some stuff that other do ottawa population be only a quarter million if you include the surround county the problem be in a system where hospital annual budget be approve by the government how do you keep political consideration out of medical decision i bet that if you an mp or mpp or good friend with one you put on any hospital urgent care list no matter how minor ymy problem which be ok unles you someone who get bump off the list for some bigshot person of influence will get their way in any system american or european it the golden rule he who ha the gold make the rule a for annual budget those be actually annual grant for facility mop pan etc give to hospital of which most be private nonprofit foundation btw i have no problem with have aggressive for-profit hospital like the french who use my approach but in the pari region they have almost a many person a canada do so their market be much more diverse the rest ha to be make up for by bill from patient who use their service would national health insurance mean that american who are now fully insured might have to settle for les in canada provincial insurance cover all health cost except dental care eyeglass prescription drug ambulance service and private hospital room so many canadian do end up buy some private insurance a policy to cover all of these thing run about to a month hmm how much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of gnp spend on health care if dentistry and optometry be include in the account maybe canada spend proportionately just a much on health care a we do the gdp figure be combine public and private expenditure for total outlay and be compile use the same method by the oecd that yield the figure for the so what happen if the health care system financially collapse how they be collect premium and i an advocate of have copayment like the french do in their system in order to make it look more like the real insurance that it be the private doctor and hospital will still be there after the insurance hypothically disappear a they be there before it appear bob ra the second least popular man in ontario warn ontarian a few year ago that if they do stop cross-border shop in such huge number the service they expect from the province just wo be there in a few year for one thing i think that bob ra be an idiot he do say so but i know he mean the ohip most of ohip come from separate premium on ymy paycheck if you be a player he want to spend my money on other thing than the health insurance my high taxe be high for other spend but health insurance which be separate and optional and it be be spend in a nonpartisan manner by every party ohip be just a health insurance plan it do not provide any kind of health care that be up to you and ymy private doctor would the private insurer take up the slack they be under no obligation to of course they could eventually make money again but if what you say be true they be loathe to do so and out of practice in handle such basic service too some of the company provide extra insurance be subsidiary of american company and their parent provide full insurance down here regardles all firm up north can easily turn on cable tv to see how well the american firm be do by be involve in basic coverage the private firm be make too much money after have get rid of basic coverage they run around pat them self on the back for their own cooperation in provide extra for those person who deserve it when private insurance realize how much money they make without the risk involve in basic insurance neurosurgery versu deluxe amenity have to call granada tv to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone private hospital room they start to pat themself on the back for their social responsibility in quebec last spring a consortium of private insurer publicly warn against any think of privatize routine low cost part of that province public health insurance plan again i doubt american would like give the insurance company that much power i half wonder if the canadian health insurer do go along with the province and the federal government year ago because they know that there wa a good chance of the public system go bust in the long run and then afterward they could clean up okay thi sort of contradict what i say higher up but it another possibility they have an add bonu when argue against government involvement in their industry-a they could then point to it failure instead of just cite theoretical principle i agree they be in a win-win situation but right now it seem that they have win bigger when you look at how full their
