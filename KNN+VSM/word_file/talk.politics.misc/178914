from gld gary l dare subject re eight myth about national health insurance pt ius daniel b case write gld gary l dare write you not buy insurance so much a be coerce into one insurance plan no it be optional a it be optional for doctor to accept it there be isolate religeou community in particular that ask for exemption and one e-mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verify for me that it be indeed negative option i gues that you can argue that there be a right to have a particular insurance but so far i not come acros that up north and i take pain to keep tab with news from home it optional but what if you do want basic coverage on the government term you say before that if you opt out you basically uninsured there be two thing at work here the public insurance be very wide in what it will cover a the amortization be also universal no private plan can boast of a plan that fit a gaussian curve and a my private sector ha discover they better off not offer insurance coverage that their customer be go to use and that turn the private insurer offer the frill into an effective cartel-they do really need to compete because a you put it they in a win-win situation and they guarantee to turn a profit believe me they probably have orgasm when they figure that out and accord to my sister the yuppie they pat themself on the back to the point of ungraciousnes at chamber of commerce luncheon so in a sense they stop be truly capitalist if they do have to worry about compete anymore you might say that the total effect be one of socialize medicine-a government provide the basic and a cartel provide the extra there be no alternative to the system desirable or not the alternative to the system be no system at all patient opt out doctor opt out or both but that only for insurance and you ca force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they will not offer and remember that the actual health care be deliver by private entity who collect from the public insurance voluntarily again they ca force a private entity to spring to life to pay them plu there be the matter of culture and value i basically anti-tax and anti-government by canadian standard yet i ca bring myself to make the same argument a you do despite that i understand where you come from up north you so much more likely to find someone protest taxe go to defence than health insurance premium to only one fund for basic coverage interesting side note-have any new insurance company start up-from scratch-since medicare become standard in canada i actually have doubt that any new one have emerge since ww i no scratch that there be a few in western canada and quite a few in quebec a part of the quebec miracle out with the nationalism in with the french capitalism la groupe de cooper ante build a new tower by the eaton store at les terrace and if you be able to catch urban angel on cb crimetime you see it a the well-lit one with double-turret at the top a for ontario which still dominate and anchor busines up north i mean new company not new build ye primarily in quebec and in albertum sorry i mustum lose you in that verbose blurb it not really insurance if you do have alternative well you have to realize that in my society that like say that it not really national defence because you ca hire ymy own rambo squad instead or even opt out a a pacifist true but i would be more comfortable with a system in which basic care provide by the government wa optional not mandatory in canada and germany it not mandatory however it be negative option in that you must request the exemption that the private sector will not provide private basic coverage if offer the option a in the quebec case tell me something about what they know either way the transient situation be hard to deal with since the change in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of person to fall sick esp in the light of disaster chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease a doctor need year of train plu internship and specialty train another problem with the u system that should be resolve do canada have something like ten time the proportion of gp to specialist that the u do ye but part of the reason be that my most of my market be too small to sustain many specialist sometime not even one so you pretty well have to be a gp to get pay and if you do get the train the doctor monopoly might block ymy get of a licence because there be already someone in the busines and who can not fill appointment book that we have a cma doctor monopoly be something that the american ama-oriented medical lobby never tell you down here the problem be in a specialty ymy skill often directly correlate to ymy pay a good cardiologist make more than a merely adequate cardiologist more than it do in general practice in that circumstance it hard to blame person for go into specialty no i respect person who do specialty okay all of my md friend be but there the question of my small market dynamic up north if anything that my private doctor and hospital sell their service to american to generate more busines will inflate their effective population serve and thu make some specialty finally viable there will be enough customer we just do not have enough sick canadian in absolute number otherwise i personally think an approach like germany would be best-where the company compete for batch of person rochester a little east of u wa able to get almost all of it population cover that way uh germany basically use my method with their many sicknes fund the competition be fake if it exist at all because they all interlink look in der spiegel or stern my girlfriend be in my german department and her uncle be a private practicioner in saarbrucken no ad for health insurance while canada organize by province germany organize the paperwork around big corporation and regional office but remember that we have province that have the same population a some major german corporation german have public health insurance just that it be broker by smaller entity actually brokerage of basic by private firm who sell extra insurance to fill out their policy sort of a voucher system wa one of the first idea float in canada too remember the german do have hmo a tell sign rochester do and they also a company town but there wa a washington post article recently about that that say canadian doctor often use myelogram instead of mri which require spinal injection and can cause seizure and headach mickey kau in the new republic probably speak for most american when he say who need that i think person here generally like to believe they can easily get the most high-tech treatment even if they really ca afford it i have to let a canadian md jump in to verify that claim but i come to learn to suspect anything in the american pres about my system if much or some of it be true you have to take u for idiot for tolerate it and give that my insurance wa instal during a period when there be only liberal and tory government federally and provincially and the socialist be still chafe they would press for real socialize medicine to fix thing think about it after all we be use the a a metric to make comparison both for keeping-up-with-the-jonese a for confirm that we do something right gld je me souvien gary l dare gld go winnipeg jet go
