from kebarne subject drug and crime a new approach wa re if drug should be legalized wdstarr william december starr write in article kebarne say i for create a clas of noncommercial drug which would include the currently illegal one which would be legal to posse grow produce but not to sell bomb the pusher back to the barter age and tax production too um why what wrong with the act of sell recreational drug even for mercenary reason get rich note by sell i mean sell the product to a consent adult at a mutually agreeable price i point thi out in an effort to pre-emptively prevent thi thread from get sidetrack onto a flamefest about push drug to schoolchild or the like and why should the user be subject to special taxation william december starr note thi be a repost of my earlier response to mr starr which wa not properly format apology to those who see the follow before to explain my position on the war on drug i offer thi drug and crime a new approach by ken barne given that the trade in illegal drug be responsible for much of the crime which afflict my nation person who want drug particularly person who be predispose to addiction will find a way to get them whether or not they be legally available despite current law enforcement effort drug be readily available to those who want them addiction to drug both legal and illegal be responsible for a significant drain on the productive resource of my country and thi occur in a variety of way from the cocaine-addicted baby who be unable to learn to the spread of disease among addict to the tragic consequence of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoke a general economic principle of government be that whatever be subsidize you get more of and whatever be tax you get le of to be most effective in confront the nation drug problem some way must be find to utilize these additional power of government to make drug deal and drug use le attractive while thi country current effort to combat legal drug have succeed in some respect there be a greater awarenes of the health consequence of smoke and designated-driver program have help reduce drink drive for example the same can not be say for the war on illegal drug there remain a core group of illegal drug user which support international network of smuggler pusher grower processor kingpin and gangster these network and their market activity which include drive by shoot corrupt law enforcement authority and smuggle weapon be directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crime commit in my country every day clearly illegal drug and rise crime be link it take only a moment reflection to recognize how they be link the link be money a with thi country fail effort to prohibit alcohol consumption a black market ha be create in which greedy local monopoly like the gangster of a bygone era have profit enormously from their illegal trade the victim of thi trade include not only the innocent person unfortunate enough to be catch in the crossfire but i would argue the drug user themself were it not for the black market and the violent monopoly of the drug lord drug user might not be the thieve robber prostitute and murderer they have become in order to pay the high price the drug lord demand in the absence of the drug lord most would be i believe simply person with a problem either a moral medical problem criminal problem let me be clear however i that we let the criminal who have be prey on my society for these many year of prohibition off the hook on the contrary the new approach i advocate be one which would not result in either the government or private industry get into the busines of promote crack cocaine or any other presently illegal drug for that matter neither be it an approach which see law abide citizen hand over more and more of their freedom and privacy in an effort to track down illegal drug user until the land of the free and the home of the brave look like a polouse state here then be my proposal possession and use of all presently illegal drug be decriminalize but buy and sell them remain illegal can grow their own marijuana a many already do today other drug user can legally import their poison of choice a long a they pay the tariff and a barter economy of drug experimenter develop because of the barter economy which supply the drug user the black market profit that have so enrich the drug lord dwindle if these drug can be obtain for or next to nothing why buy them nevertheles there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommercial drug even at relatively low price therefore law enforcement activity be concentrate on those individual who continue to buy and sell and also on the crime commit by drug user too poor to afford even low price but here be where the strategy begin to differentiate between the drug dealer the victimizer and the drug user their victim upon arrest suspect be permit to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test those who choose to cooperate be inform that upon conviction for the crime they be accuse of if they be find to be a drug user they will be institutionalize until they be clean and only then will they begin to serve their sentence if they choose to cooperate and be already drug-free they can begin to serve their sentence right away those who choose not to undergo the drug test and be convict face stiffer fine and serve longer sentence institutionalization of drug use criminal serve several purpose drug use criminal and thi include drink driver be separate from their source of supply thu reduce the total number of drug user in society at large and consequently decrease the demand for drug on the street put more of the remain drug dealer out of busines institutionalization provide an incentive for drug use criminal to straighten themself out before become part of the general prison population while help protect society from crime institutionalization could also serve to deter drug user from become criminal since drug use criminal unlike other criminal would be delay prior to serve their sentence by the additional time it take for them to sober up institutionalization of drug use criminal separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitor pool of addict who could volunteer for research study of new technique and treatment for addictive disease with the potential to benefit both themself and other dealer in illegal drug be generally not drug user themself and thi be particularly true of the drug bos or kingpin run large illicit organization under thi proposal dealer would be more readily identifiable since upon arrest they would presumably pa the drug test or else decline to take it in order to avoid have to explain why they be in possession of drug when it be apparent they do not use them declining to take the test they would of course face stiffer penalty while each case of attempt sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own it merit the outcome of a suspect drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution just a cigarette taxe have contribute to the decline of smoke in my country by make cigarette more costly while at the same time provide revenue for anti-smoking campaign noncommercial drug should be tax and the money generate should be use to combat their use enforcement of thi tax should be on a voluntary basi however and should not be use a an excuse to infringe on the right and privacy of noncommercial drug user since to do so would have the effect of reintroduce prohibition instead drug user will be encourage to pay the tax by remind them that if untaxed drug be ever find in their possession during the course of routine polouse operation they will be require to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drug to be destroy if drug dealer be find to be sell noncommercial drug on which taxe have not be pay they will face additional prosecution for evade the tax the strategy of add tax evasion to drug deal charge be already in use in some jurisdiction but it effectivenes be currently limit by the illegality of drug possession revenue from drug possession taxe and import tariff would be use to fund anti-drug advertise campaign and provide support to private sector drug treatment program for those unable to afford treatment taxpayer subsidy to all drug producer must be end federal support of tobacco farm be both immoral and wasteful in thi era of tight budget and the marijuana crop grow illicitly on federal land in many state must likewise be eliminate while my proposal would have the effect of permit the use of what be now illegal drug it would hold the user of all drug responsible for their action and i believe would reduce the harm drug have on my society particularly the crime cause by the illegal drug trade so long a we remain a free nation with relatively porou border and freedom for my citizen to travel we will alway have a drug problem whether it take the form of heroin addict die in abandon build drink driver kill and maim other on my street or emphysema patient struggle for breath after a lifetime of smoke the result be the same needle suffer and death a a society we must recognize that while my society permit u to harm ourself with drug a we be already do regardles of the drug law we must take a stand against the harm that drug and drug user cause to other we must particularly oppose the viciou and violent cartel which prey on the weaknes of drug user by take the profit out of their deadly trade my proposal go a long way toward shut down these powerful criminal organization the question of whether drug use be a moral or medical problem depend on which group of drug user you talk about different drug have different effect and some be more addictive than other the addictivenes of a drug also often vary between individual and so we have some person who can drink alcohol in moderation while other find they can not resist the bottle nicotine which former surgeon general c everett koop declare to be a addict a heroin be a legal drug with know harmful effect and while some person can stop smoke by willpower alone other continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer for those individual who can stop take drug on their own we may argue that because they have choose to use them thi represent a moral failure on their part or an unwillingnes to face the difficulty of life but for the addict while they may have choose to use drug the first time by the time they discover their addiction it be too late we can not hold them responsible for their disease any more than we would blame someone who be drown for an inability to swim perhap they should have know not to go near the water or perhap someone should have warn them of the danger but in their present circumstance warn will not help neither do it help for the drug dealer on the shore to be toss them weight standard
