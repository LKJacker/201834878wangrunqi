of the economy of the industrialize world be now suffer from slow growth they make many of the smart investment and the tough choice which my government ha for too long ignore that why many of them

and we do have much to show for it we know that wage of most work person have stop rise that most person be work longer work week and that too many family can no longer afford the escalate cost of

just two month ago i give congres my plan for long-term job and economic growth it change the old priority in washington and put my emphasi where it need to be on person real need on increase investment and job and education on cut the federal deficit on stop the waste which pay no dividend and redirect my preciou resource toward investment that create job now and lay the groundwork for robust economic growth in the future these new direction pass the congres in record time and create a new sense of hope and opportunity in my country then the job plan i present to congres which would create hundred of thousand of job most of them in the private sector in and pass the house of representative it now ha the support of a majority of the united state senate but it be hold up by a filibuster of a minority in the senate just senator they block a vote that they know would result in the passage of my bill and the creation of job the issue be politic the issue be person million of american be wait for thi legislation and count on it count on u in washington but the job bill ha be ground by gridlock i know the american person be tire of busines a usual and politic a usual i know they do want u to spin or wheel they want the recovery to get move so i have take a first step to break thi gridlock and go the extra mile yesterday i offer to cut the size of thi plan by percent from billion to billion it not what i hop for with million american look for full-time work i simply ca let the bill languish when i know that even a compromise bill will mean hundred of thousand of job for my person the mandate be to act to achieve change and move the country forward by take thi initiative in the face of an unrelenting senate talkathon i think we can respond to ymy mandate and achieve a significant portion of my original goal first we want to keep the program a much a possible that be need to generate job and meet human need include highway and road construction summer job for young person immunization for child construction of waste water site and aid to small business we also want to keep fund for extend unemployment compensation benefit for person who have be unemployed for a long time because the economy be create job second i recommend that all the other program in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than percent and third i recommend a new element in thi program to help u immediately start my attempt to fight against crime by provide million for city and town to rehire polouse officer who lose their job during the recession and put them back to work protect my person i also go to fight for a tough crime bill because the person of thi country need it and deserve it now the person who be filibuster thi bill the republican senator say they wo vote for it because it increase deficit spend because there extra spend thi year that ha already be approve that sound reasonable do it here what they do say thi program be more than pay for by budget cut over my five-year budget and thi budget be well within the spend limit already approve by the congres thi year it amaze to me that many of these same senator who be filibuster the bill vote during the previou administration for billion of dollar of the same kind of emergency spend and much of it wa not design to put the american person to work thi be not about deficit spend we have offer a plan to cut the deficit thi be about where ymy priority be on person or on politic keep in mind that my job bill be pay for dollar for dollar it be pay for by budget cut and it the soundest investment we can now make for ourself and my child i urge all american to take another look at thi job and investment program to consider again the benefit for all of u when we help make more american partner work to ensure the future of my nation and the strength of my economy you know if every american who want a job have one we would have a lot of the other problem we have in thi country today thi bill be not a miracle it a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in thi country again but it a step we ought to take and it be fully pay for over the life of my budget tell ymy lawmaker what you think tell them how important the bill be if it pas we all be winner good morning and thank you for listen end edt
