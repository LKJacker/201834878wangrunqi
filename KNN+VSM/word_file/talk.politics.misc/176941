from clinton-hq subject clinton pres availability with russian pres the white house office of the pres secretary vancouver british columbium for immediate release april pres conference by the president with russian pres canada place vancouver british columbium pdt q i have two question for both president so you could probably answer for bori too laughter the president i give you my answer then i give you yeltsin answer laughter q the first be that thi be the meet of the president so the money that be promise be government money and naturally it go to be distribute through the government but you indicate that three-quarter be go to be go to business so the question be how the russian business themself be go to be consult if ever what be the priority because there be several association of russian businessman exist already so will they be invite to participate in set up priority for investment thi be the first and second to you we know that poll public poll in america do not show that american be very enthusiastic about give thi aid like newsweek poll say that about percent do approve it and new york time publish that percent support if it just prevent civil war percent if it foster democratic reform and only percent if it just personally support yeltsin how be you go to sort of handle thi problem that american themself be not very enthusiastic thank you q i have a question i sorry be there go to be a translation of everything into russian no just the answer just the answer okay the president the answer to the first question be it depend on what kind of aid we discuss for example the fund that will be set up for finance new business will obviously go to those business who apply and who seem to be good risk and make the application the privatization fund will be use to support the privatization of exist public enterprise then there be some other general fund in the democracy corps and other thing which person in russium will have some influence over the distribution of with regard to ymy second question let me say that i would think that there would be person in both country who would not feel too warmly toward simply the american government give money to the russian government there opposition to that in russium and in my country throughout my whole history there ha be an opposition to foreign aid of all kind that be thi ha nothing to do with russium if you look at the whole history of america any kind of aid program ha alway be unpopular what i have try to tell the american person be be thi be not an aid program thi be an investment program that thi be an investment in my future we spend trillion trillion on armament on soldier and other investment because of the cold war now with a democratic government in russium with the newly independent state the remainder of them work on a democracy and struggle to get their economy go it seem to me very much in my interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive for the economy of russium to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there and for u to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapon and other element of hostility on both side on my side and on the russian side so i do see thi a an aid program thi be an investment for the united state thi be very much in the interest of the united state the thing i announce today the second stage of the program which i hope to put together next week in my view be thing that be good for my country and for the taxpayer and worker of my country russium be a very great nation that need some partnership now some common endeavor with other person who share her goal but it would be a great mistake for anyone to view thi a some sort of just a charity or an aid issue that not what it be it an investment for america and it a wonderful investment like all investment there be some risk but there far le risk with a far greater potential of return than the trillion we spend look at each other acros the barrier of the cold war q mr president first of all thank you very much indeed for come here and talk to u in the memory of the live correspondent thi be the first time an american president be do thi to the russian pres corp so it kind of a very measure breakthrough i have two question one in ymy introductory remark of the other pres conference you mention in brief that you discuss the start ius and start i issue could you tell u did you reach an agreement with president yeltsin a to what might be do in order to have ukraine join the ratification of start i and the npt regime and my second question be how confident you be that the united state congres would be eager to support you in lift jackson-vanik and other restriction inherit from the cold war president clinton first we discuss the issue of ukraine with regard to start i and npt and generally with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent state all be non-nuclear but also to have the united state develop strong relationship with them we know that one thing that we could do that would increase i think the willingnes of the ukraine to support thi direction be to successfully conclude my own negotiation on highly enrich uranium because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for russium but also for ukraine and it would show some reach out on my part but we agree that basically the person who sign off on the lisbon protocol have get to honor what they do and we agree to continue to pres that i myself have spend a good deal of time try to reassure ukraine leader specifically the president and the foreign minister that i want strong ty with ukraine that the united state very much want a good relationship with ukraine but that in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of ukraine and to have the united state be fully supportive the commitment to ratify start i and to join the npt regime be critical what wa the second question the president with regard to jackson-vanik and cocom i would make two point first i have agree with the republican and democratic leader in the congres that we will a soon a i return have a list of all the legislative and other restriction some of them be regulatory in nature impose on relation between the united state and russium that be legacy of the cold war and we will see whether they how many of them we could agree to do away with right now at least among the leadership of the congres with regard to jackson-vanik i think there will be an opennes to change the law if the congres be convince there be in fact no more refusnik no more person who wish to emigrate who be not be allow to if the fact be that there be no one there who would have be who the law wa design to affect then i think that the desire to keep the law will be much le with regard to cocom my gues be and it nothing more than a gues that the leadership of congres and indeed my own adviser might prefer to see some sort of phase movement out of the cocom regime but i think they would be will to begin it in the fairly near future q mr clinton when i read ymy speech in annapoli i get the impression that you have a completely different personal and i stres that personal not political approach toward russium compare to the approach of mr bush could you formulate in a few word what be the difference between you a a personality and ymy approach the difference between ymy approach to russium and the approach of mr bush and who make you why do you cite akhmatova in the last part of ymy speech the president let me say first i do not wish to compare myself with president bush or anyone else i ca say what wa in hi heart about russium i can say that since i wa a boy i have be personally fascinate with the history the music and the culture and the literature of russium i have be thrill by russian music since i wa a seriou student of music for more than year now i have read major russian novelist and many of ymy poet and follow ymy ballet and try to know a much a i could about ymy history and i go to the soviet union but it wa then the soviet union you may know it wa a big issue in the last presidential campaign that i spend the first week of alone in moscow and do not return again until three day before mr yeltsin wa elect president but all that time i wa away i wa follow event there very closely and hop for the day when we could be genuine partner so i have alway have a personal feel about russium i remember for example a lot of you know i like music very much one of the most move experience for me a a musician wa when leonard bernstein take the new york philharmonic to moscow and play shostakovich fifth symphony to the russian and he play the last movement more rapidly than anyone have ever play it before because it wa technically so difficult that be something i follow very closely when it occur these be thing that have alway have a big impact on my life and i have just alway hop that someday if i ever have the chance to i could play a role in see my two country become closer partner applause the pres thank you pdt
