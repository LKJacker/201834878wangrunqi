from clinton-hq subject clinton pres briefing by george stephanopoulo the white house office of the pres secretary for immediate release april pres briefing by george stephanopoulo the briefing room edt mr stephanopoulo i gues i just prepare to take question today q george bob dole say that the clinton administration policy on bosnium be a failure and that he want the united state to take the lead in lift the arm embargo so that the bosnian muslim can defend themself mr stephanopoulo a you know president clinton ha say that that suggestion be under active consideration obviously thi be a tragic situation in bosnium and if the bosnian serb do come to the negotiate table in a constructive way we look seriously at press for lift the arm embargo in the meantime we go to continue to pres for a tough sanction resolution in the we go to continue to work on the serb to come to the negotiate table but the prospect of an arm embargo be something the president certainly will consider if the serb do come to the table q how much longer be you go to give them to come to the table george mr stephanopoulo we work on that right now q it be a long time q on february the president mention the value add tax in ohio and when he wa ask about it later by reporter he say quote that be a radical change in the tax system of the united state it something i think we may have to look at in the year ahead questioned again about it later he say it be not something that be now under consideration if we start consider it i tell you it wa a trial balloon or anything he say i wa just discuss the tax response to a question donna shalala quote in usa today thi morning quote certainly we look at a vat what go on q the same with alouse rivlin thi morning mr stephanopoulo the health care task force be review a number of option they have make any decision yet and a i have say from thi podium time and time again we not go to comment on decision that have be make q but you have also say from thi podium time and time again q wait a minute whoa nelly whoa q that that wa not under consideration q ye clinton say it be not something that be now under consideration is that no longer true mr stephanopoulo i believe the work group a m shalala say ha look at thi prospect but no decision have be make of any kind q well i know but he say he tell u about it if it wa ever under consideration i take it that now he be and he do tell u about it or mr stephanopoulo did he say if it wa under consideration or if it wa something to be propose q if we start consider i tell you mr stephanopoulo if it something to be propose q if we start consider it i tell you that a direct quote mr stephanopoulo the task force ha look at a number of different option they have not make any decision yet the president ha not make any decision yet thi be one of the proposal under consideration by the task force wa to go out and cast a wide a net a possible for different idea on how to reform the health care system they have cast a very wide net they have look at hundred of different proposal probably thousand of different proposal but the president ha not make any decision q well be the president aware of their consideration of thi option mr stephanopoulo i do know if he be brief on any preliminary conclusion or anything like that from the task force on thi specific proposal of any kind i do know that that get to hi level he start yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decision and i do believe that that be present to him no q well he not rely on the usa today to tell him what hi task force be consider in the way of taxe mr stephanopoulo no he go through it in a very deliberate fashion there be a number of decision that have to be make i do know that thi proposal ha reach that decision make point q if thi be still under consideration that a change at least from what we be tell by dee dee i think about three week ago or so she say that be not an option talk about the have a big argument with somebody over thi so i remember it specifically and say it not once but twice is that not the case mr stephanopoulo again i do know if thi ha be present to the president a something that be be look at at some level in the task force q it wa rule it out though i mean unlike other option that you keep in the mix thi one specifically wa rule out mr stephanopoulo again thi be something that be be look at but no decision ha be make of any kind i mean it do it not necessarily material until you get to the decision-making phase the work group be look at hundred of different option q if it wa rule out before and it not rule out now then something ha change george ye no q when a guy say in february mr stephanopoulo well the work group be look at the widest possible range of option q so something change they be look at it before they look at it now mr stephanopoulo well i do know if the work group have get to that point yet they be cast a very wide net q how wa it possible that you and dee dee be able to sell definitively rule it out a an option previously and now be say that in fact it be be consider mr stephanopoulo again the work group be look at a wide range of option they have not q do you deny that you and dee dee rule it flatly rule it out on several occasion in the past month mr stephanopoulo i do deny that i mean those be the president word those be very clear q subsequent to the president word do you deny that within the last month you and dee dee have both publicly rule it out mr stephanopoulo i do know about the time i think what we do wa refer back to the president word and say they stand q so do they stand any longer q march clinton say for the next fmy to five year it wa rule out mr stephanopoulo well those word the president do say that in february the work group be on a separate track and a i say i do believe q separate from the president mr stephanopoulo i do believe thi ha be present to the president q are they consider something that the president q ha rule out q ha rule out i mean will the president consider a vat tax mr stephanopoulo again the work group have not present thi to the president they have look at a wide range of option i suppose that if an argument be make he will clearly listen to it that do not mean he ha decide to do it q can we put thi another way in hi answer in ohio he look at the vat in term of restructure the whole tax system under those that wa the circumstance that he say it might be consider at some future point is that no longer the case or be that the only way that he can see a vat emerge mr stephanopoulo i gues i not sure exactly what you ask q he talk about the vat in the context of a restructure tax system not a a specific way to finance health care for example q or anything else q or anything else q it wa alway in the context of substitute for other taxe at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system mr stephanopoulo right q ha that change too q is that still hi view mr stephanopoulo i have speak about those specific comment i think i can just go back to it be the work group have they examine the possibility of a vat ye they have q certainly we look at a vat she say mr stephanopoulo they have examine the possibility of a vat ha it be present to the president ha he make a decision no he ha not q what kind of a deal do you have when you get the president appoint task force obviously not obliviou to hi rule something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform go ahead on it own and consider a tax which he ha specifically rule out in any context other than much later and then go ahead and announce that that what they look at is the president concern about that sort of thing mr stephanopoulo i think that the president concern be to make sure he get the best health care proposal possible he concern with make sure that they have the most thorough proces for examine all the possible alternative all the different alternative if a decision be make to go forward with something like that it certainly something the president will explain and justify but no decision ha be make along those line q what do it mean exactly though when the president rule something out do it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument be make mr stephanopoulo that just that indisputably true if you but at the same time he ha not rule it in he ha not make a proposal q what make him open to it now when he wa open to it before mr stephanopoulo he certainly will to listen to the argument q wa he will to listen to the argument for a short-term tax thi year and he wa will to listen to it in chilicothe he now open to it mr stephanopoulo the context of hi comment wa that it wa not something he want to be clear that thi be not something he wa propose not something he wa float q not something he wa consider those be hi word it not something that now under consideration if we start consider it i tell you you now acknowledge be you not that it be under consideration and mr stephanopoulo i acknowledge that the task force ha study thi proposal i be also state that the president ha not make a decision on it q but the door be open for the president to reconsider include thi a part of mr stephanopoulo obviously the work group be look at it again but the president ha not make a decision q do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the vat to him mr stephanopoulo i do know that i assume that if i do know what stage they be it in propose i do know that they go to make the conclusion that thi be something they should present to him i know thi be something the work group be look at q do you understand george that none of u be ask these question in context of a decision that the president ha make only about what the president be consider mr stephanopoulo i understand that and i be acknowledge that the work group have examine the issue of a vat q and the president will consider it mr stephanopoulo i assume that he will consider the argument if it be present to him q do that mean the president that work group think that when the president say no he mean maybe laughter mr stephanopoulo i think that mean that the work group be try to do the most thorough job possible q george can i ask you another question about bosnium mr stephanopoulo sure laughter q no he want u to stay on thi q let do gay in the military laughter q no he get out of that swamp q i think we get the bottom line on that vat reggie bartholomew ymy special ambassador in belgrade today say that if the serb do not accept the agreement that ha be work out quote we will do my part to pursue the lift of the arm embargo together with my ally that seem to go a bite further than what you just say mr stephanopoulo sound almost exactly what i just say q well do you accept in other word you accept what reggie mr stephanopoulo well the president ha say that thi be something that under consideration it be something he will consider if the current action do bring the serb to the table q is there some kind of timetable here mr stephanopoulo ye there be a timetable there go to be a vote on the resolution in about day q that on sanction that on tighten the sanction mr stephanopoulo that right that sanction and we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure and we hope that that will bring the serb to the table a you know mr bartholomew also meet with mr churkin of russium and they be also work on way to bring the serb to the table we will continue to pressure them in many different way and thi be one possible option a well q the question be whether there a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lift the arm embargo not the sanction mr stephanopoulo the next vote in the be on sanction a far a i know there be no vote schedule on lift the arm embargo but it be something that we have discuss both internally and with my ally q why do reggie bartholomew tell the serb that the would do that what wa the point of hi tell them that mr stephanopoulo well clearly i mean thi be something that under consideration and thi be something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table they should know the consequence of fail to come to the table q have they be give a deadline q warren christopher ha be say the same thing and it ha seem to change the serb behavior in the least why should the serb take any heed of a threat to lift the arm embargo when so far everything that be do ha have no effect on the fight in bosnium mr stephanopoulo i just do accept the premise of ymy question it ha have an effect the embargo be have an effect q what effect mr stephanopoulo if the serbian choose not to heed my warn then they will face the consequence q what effect ha it have in bosnium mr stephanopoulo well the effect that it ha have on the serbian it ha tighten up they be not get their shipment through we can brief more fully q in bosnium george in bosnium what effect ha it have mr stephanopoulo well it hard to say if it stop the aggression to date that be why we continue to pres for the serbian to stop but we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the serb and that will have an effect i not say it go to happen overnight it clearly ha happen overnight but we believe that over time the sanction can weaken the serb if it fail to work and if the serb fail to come to the negotiate table we move forward with the embargo q is there a work deadline george of the the same date a the the schedule vote ha the united state say along with many of the other nato ally that if the serb be will to sign on to the peace accord by then that we seek have we say that we will seek mr stephanopoulo we say continually we go to q but on that deadline mr stephanopoulo i do have a specific date but we go to move forward with the resolution the resolution by around that time and if that fail to take effect if that fail to bring the serb to the table we will clearly consider other action q is thi awfully incremental mr stephanopoulo we take a step-by-step approach we ratchet up the pressure and we go to continue to do that q is there a possibility george that by the time all these incremental step be take the serb will have achieve their goal and then what the purpose mr stephanopoulo i think the purpose be to get the serb to stop the aggression we be pursue that goal on many different front we be pursue it through the we pursue it through direct talk we be pursue it through tighten the sanction and we will consider lift the arm embargo we be turn the screw up on the serb and we will continue to do that q but if the effort have be unsuccessful in get the serb to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the serb give back what they gain i mean once they entrench mr stephanopoulo i ca speculate on that we go to continue to pres for them to come to the table now we go to continue to find way to stop the aggression but i ca see into the future q george on the stimulu package house republican say they go to hold a series of town meet on saturday to try and explain the detail of ymy package they cite poll which show that the more person learn about it the le they like it what ymy strategy to counter that mr stephanopoulo the strategy we have be the one we go to continue a you saw the president today point up the very real benefit of the summer job program that thi package will provide new summer job thi summer for kid in inner city and suburb to do productive work we be also go to point out the benefit of the highway money the investment in highway we go to point up the benefit of immunization we go to point up the benefit of head start we be go to say that the republican have a choice they can take action to create job or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last fmy year q do it concern you though that the house now the house republican be after you a well a the senate mr stephanopoulo the house republican vote against it before they make a mistake then they make a mistake now q george do it strike anybody in the administration that it a bite strong to describe a the president do thi morning the summer job program a quote a reaffirmation of a promise of america mr stephanopoulo not at all i think it the promise of america to give kid a chance to reach their full potential q government-funded job mr stephanopoulo to give person a chance to work absolutely that be the promise of america q i want to follow up on something i ask yesterday where do summer job where do that figure come from mr stephanopoulo that be on top of i do look at it there be currently summer job in the pipeline thi will be on top of the so it will be a total of million q the would be create by the stimulu package mr stephanopoulo ye q where do that number come from because we be tell all along that the stimulu package would create new job and accord to panettum that break down to something like full-time job and summer job mr stephanopoulo ye but the summer that when you do their full-time equivalence i mean individual will receive job thi summer when you calculate it for the full-time job effect you have to do i do know what the exact formula be q seven hundred thousand part-time job mr stephanopoulo or q one to fmy because it three month mr stephanopoulo thank you q can i follow up on that did the president misspeak thi morning when he say that some of the government money for these summer job will pay for private for kid to work in the private sector mr stephanopoulo not necessarily i mean i think that there will be grant available that one of the way that you pay for the job at the same time he also issue a challenge to the private sector to hire kid on their own a well q tax dollar for instance would pay for kid to work at time-warner mr stephanopoulo i think the time-warner be actually somebody come forward and actually do a grant that go to be the bulk of it there could be isolate instance though where there would be grant to business q ha the president speak with any senate republican thi week mr stephanopoulo no but there be a lot of contact with senate republican in the white house q at a lower level but the president ha mr stephanopoulo the president ha not no q getting any closer to get the vote mr stephanopoulo we continue to work on it q anybody lean ymy way q on haitus the new york time seem to be report something of a breakthrough in aristide attitude toward the coup leader can you confirm that there ha be thi change and what impact will it have on the proces and what do pezzullo have to say yesterday in hi report mr stephanopoulo pezzullo do brief the principal i ca confirm what actually happen in the talk i would leave that to the negotiator themself but mr caputo ha return to haitus we have receive a brief here at the white house from ambassador pezzullo and a we have say time and time again we believe that assurance of security be important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement q george yesterday you offer some selective breakdown of how the stimulu would impact some state and city can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these job would be impact mr stephanopoulo i think we have it for most state ye and i think we can get it out q could you make that generally available mr stephanopoulo i believe we can q and could you do it by the component of the stimulu in other word mr stephanopoulo i do know if we can do i know that we can do it by summer job and other job i do know how deeply it can be break down but clearly we can break it down into summer job and other job q and can i follow up is thi the information that jeff eller and the rest of the white house be use in the ad in the state mr stephanopoulo i do know if they ad but they pres release q can you describe what those pres release contain mr stephanopoulo all we do be point out the benefit of thi package to variou state for instance i know that today senator dole be head up to vermont and new hampshire and i would point out that the stimulu package the job package create job in vermont it create job in new hampshire and the person of those state should remind him that thi be important q where be the release go mr stephanopoulo they go to the state q to whom mr stephanopoulo we can get them it no problem q can we get it q why do you put them out here a well mr stephanopoulo i think we can q thi afternoon would that be possible mr stephanopoulo i have to check i do know but a soon a we can q are you focus these pres release on state where there be moderate or pragmatic republican senator mr stephanopoulo i think we try to get a many a we can it actually quite difficult to pull thi together and we do my best we put them out a we get them q why be you so closely track senator dole schedule mr stephanopoulo i wa just follow it q are pres release go along to state where he visit mr stephanopoulo i not sure i think that probably there be pres release go to vermont laughter q will there be a man in a chicken suit wait laughter q george a the president go about the busines of defend what in hi stimulu package he do addres what seem to be the republican main point that you fund it with deficit spend rather than if it so important why not come up with the fund for it seem to be the republican argument and how do you answer that mr stephanopoulo what wa answer be we be pay for it over time and if you look at my budget we pay for thi package over time we believe right now the economy need a jump start for job q you not claim be you that that do add to the deficit thi year mr stephanopoulo i say we pay for it over time i do say that q i know that george but i mean from the begin the question we do have annual budget and thing deficit spend will pay for that thi year will it not mr stephanopoulo thi year they clearly will but over time my budget fully pay for thi program q what you say be that there be save that would cover thi if it be thi year in future year mr stephanopoulo absolutely that exactly what i say q i know that but there be go to be outstanding debt it will add to the national debt from thi year mr stephanopoulo no we reduce the deficit by billion billion over the next fmy year q you mean you reduce it below what it would have be mr stephanopoulo exactly q in fact you add a very large amount to the national debt over the period of mr stephanopoulo but we reduce it far more from what it would have be that true q washington-type reduction laughter q you get to be a grumpy old man q george ha any decision be make about the white house or the president participation in the gay right march come up in a week and a half mr stephanopoulo we work on the president schedule now i believe he go to be at the senate democratic retreat in jamestown that weekend q will he addres it by phone mr stephanopoulo i do know about that it a little far out but i believe he go to be in the senate retreat q so will he have the leader in a day or two before the speech mr stephanopoulo i do know i would expect that at some point he would meet with the leader of some of these group i do know the schedule on it though q will there be an aid czar appoint prior to or in conjunction with the event mr stephanopoulo i just not sure q april be earth day what be the president go to do to mark that and be it the case that he be go to sign the biodiversity treaty that day mr stephanopoulo i know there be some work on the biodiversity treaty i do know about sign it that day but i would expect he have a statement on earth day or right around then q where be the work on the biodiversity treaty mr stephanopoulo i have to check with katie mcginty i just know that there be some work do but i do know exactly what q when be earth day mr stephanopoulo the i think q why be it you know that he be go to have a statement on earth day but you do know if he go to have a statement on the gay right march mr stephanopoulo i say i do know if he go to meet or when he go to meet q do you have a statement on the gay right march mr stephanopoulo i do actually no i would be surprise if he do though q do you have some detail on the miyazawa visit mr stephanopoulo it a work visit on friday and the president be look forward to that in discuss a number of issue include russian aid and the japanese stimulu package and the trade issue between the two country q there wa some expectation that a second aid package to russium wa go to be unveil at the meet and if i understand it ha happen why be that or what the statu on that mr stephanopoulo the meet be still go on and a you know secretary bentsen and christopher have talk about the outline of a possible package but we go to continue to consult with congres and my ally on that q we will not then make any kind of announcement during the two-day meet mr stephanopoulo the meet not over yet q is that when you go to make one mr stephanopoulo i not rule out the possibility q the president go to announce it tomorrow q bentsen say that q ye bentsen say it would be tomorrow q so do christopher mr stephanopoulo i have to look at that but i believe it be more likely that the announcement will come out of tokyo q george ha there be further consideration here about go to send the president out to lo angele mr stephanopoulo i do know that there it not something we rule out we do have a date set for it q george you all have a position or do you support immigration plan to settle iraqi prisoner in the united state mr stephanopoulo it the first i hear of it q george there wa a report today about the q fortunately laughter q about the pace of appointment and say that president clinton be behind president bush in the number of position that person have be nominate for are you go to speed up the pace of nomination or where do you stand with it mr stephanopoulo we fill of the president appointment and it break down we have schedule c noncareer se pa full-time i not sure what that mean laughter pa full-time and thi be about the same it about the same pace of president bush obviously a you move along farther once you each level of appointment actually ha a multiplier effect and free up far more appointment so we expect the proces to speed up but we at the pace of bush obviously we like to get these do a quickly a possible i would point out that the fbi background check and the background check be far more comprehensive and it take more time than my predecessor and that be part of the holdup but we work on it q is that because of nannygate mr stephanopoulo i think that an awful big part of it ye q in the story thi morning you be at approximately the same pace a bush in make appointment but way behind in win confirmation mr stephanopoulo that where the background check come into play that the problem q that the background check problem because i mean you have a democratic senate mr stephanopoulo no that not the you make the appointment and then it take quite a bite of time to fill out all the form and have the background check do that exactly where the problem be q what the president do thi afternoon and what on the plan for tomorrow mr stephanopoulo he get some meet just office meet thi afternoon for the most part on a variety of issue that probably a half-dozen different issue and then he be tomorrow we have an event probably again focus on the stimulu and job package out of here at the white house and friday be the miyazawa
