will meet with hi principal advisor on bosnium and at he meet with president vaclav havel there will be a photo op at the top of that meet no formal pres conference afterward any question q is he move

he try to contact president mitterrand again today and he continue to discus it we do have any specific timetable but obviously the situation there be very seriou q ha he call janet reno today or yesterday m myer i do believe he speak to her today q why do he have nothing to say about thi publicly except on the piece of paper that wa put out last night at m myer he do he answer a question about it yesterday q before anything have happen m myer before anything happen he put out q since something ha happen he have nothing to say m myer he put out a statement on it last night and we have more to say about it later today q in what forum be that go to be m myer it will be at the photo in the rose garden q he will talk about waco at that m myer ye he have something to say q is that something we can take live m myer i think it will be brief we can talk a little later about the exact structure a we work it out but i do know if it something you want to take live q will he take question on waco at that time a well m myer he probably take a few q is there any reason why he ha talk to the attorney general m myer i have to double-check i do know that he ha talk to her thi morning q and she do come here thi morning to see him or anyone else m myer no q and he do talk yesterday q what the reaction to her resignation statement that she make last night m myer she wa ask a question about it and she answer the question the president ha absolutely no intention of ask for the attorney general resignation he stand behind her percent a you know he wa inform about the decision he take full responsibility for that and stand percent behind attorney general reno q the question now arise yesterday we be tell that he wa brief on thi but we never get a firm idea of how much he know of what the plan wa and the justification for the plan and the justification of the time wa he fully inform on all of that all of thi about the increase level of violence inside the compound that make them want to go now the feel that nothing else wa go to succeed et cetera m myer he talk with the attorney general about the decision about she talk to him about the factor that lead to her decision he raise no objection he support her decision to go forward with it he wa fully brief q of course hindsight be but look back now do the president do the white house feel that the decision he sign off on prove to be the right way to go when you look at what actually happen m myer i think everybody feel bad when life be lose but i do think that that be reason to second-gues the decision he stand behind the decision that wa make he wa inform about it he wa fully brief about it and he stand percent behind the attorney general the justice department and the fbi it a difficult operation and there it have already go on for more than seven week fmy federal agent have lose their life in the line of duty let not forget that thi wa a very difficult situation and all the decision involve be very difficult but all the agent on the grind the fbi the justice department all recommend move forward with thi they think give the circumstance it wa the best possible course of action there just no point in second guess those decision now i think that there a reason q why not they have to m myer no not to second-gues the decision i think it important to take a look at it to have an investigation i think the president will talk some about that later today but at thi from thi vantage point to second-gues those decision it not useful q you sound like he go to order an investigation of what happen and whether m myer i think he have more to say about that later ye q he will order an investigation m myer he have more ye he have more to say about an investigation q what kind of investigation m myer he have more to say about it later q but in the monday morning quarterback surely there be some soul-searching now a to whether it wa the right decision you ca say that we do the best we could when it turn out to be a rather a debacle m myer i think we obviously we review the situation and all the factor that lead to a very tragic outcome i do think anybody dispute that the outcome wa tragic but again the president stand behind the decision that be make and we take a look at the factor that contribute to that q what wa the fbi director role in thi m myer well he wa obviously involve in set up the operation he sign off on it a do the agent that be on the grind that be work with him i do believe he speak to the president but i double-check that q but he wa very closely involve in every aspect of plan and so forth m myer i would refer you to the fbi on exactly what aspect he wa involve with q will janet reno be come over to the white house today m myer there no plan meet i do believe that she be here q she wo be at thi event at m myer no no plan to be q do you think that there go to be a jump on on the part of political opposition to make something out of thi in term of to the president detriment politically m myer well i would certainly hope that person would try to use thi tragedy for political reason obviously i think again that it useful to look at the fact to reevaluate the fact and i think the president will move forward with that but i think person understand that thi wa a difficult series of decision that it wa a very difficult situation that it wa cause by a man who wa a cult leader who wa involve in the death of fmy federal agent and i think it most tragic that a lot of innocent child lose their life in thi i do think anybody dispute the tragedy of the outcome q dee dee what wa the white house role in handle the i gues public relation aspect in the aftermath who wa talk who here at the white house wa talk with person at justice to set up reno news conference to do all that sort of thing m myer i think the attorney general handle her end of the situation herself and make the decision to go ahead with the news conference once there wa a point at which there wa enough information i think to talk with some accuracy about what have transpire during the day obviously person here at a number of level be keep in touch with person at the justice department and at the fbi to try to keep inform about what wa happen there q but reno say that she do talk to the president and there seem to be an indication she have talk to anybody at the white house so who m myer there be person talk on a staff-to staff level q i understand but who at the justice department wa handle that for reno who wa talk to the white house m myer there be a number of person a you know webb hubbell be the liaison to the white house and i know he talk to a number of person here there be a number of person at a number of different level involve i do want to get into exactly who have what conversation with whom but there be a number of conversation obviously the justice department wa work to keep the white house inform the pres inform to the best of it ability a event unfold throughout the day q did webb hubbell talk to the president m myer i do believe so i do know if he talk he may have at one point q and wa the white house role just to seek information about what happen or wa it to direct the public information campaign that follow m myer it wa both to keep abreast of the situation so the president could be on top of it but i think the justice department manage it pres relation on it we be obviously very interest in what wa happen there throughout the day and the president wa follow it very closely throughout the day q dee dee on that though if the president wa follow it so closely and he have talk the night before with janet reno why would he talk to her at all since then m myer again i do know if he talk to her thi morning again he keep fully aware of what ha be go on throughout the day he stand percent behind her decision he be fully supportive of her a he say yesterday morning before event transpire and yesterday afternoon in a write statement q but would he want to convey those think to her personally yesterday m myer one more time i do know if they speak thi morning q no yesterday q clearly there a perception that she wa leave hang out to dry all day yesterday m myer that just not true i think we say throughout the day that the president take full responsibility that he stand i do know how much clearer we can be the president stand foursquare behind the attorney general on thi he accept full responsibility for the event that transpire he believe that janet reno the justice department and the fbi act a best they could give the circumstance and the fact that be evident at the time i do know what else he can say to show that he support her percent q one of the best indication of that be to pick up the phone and tell her m myer again i do know whether they speak thi morning q why ca we find out m myer well we can i ca do it stand here right now q you get six person here all they get to do be pick up the phone m myer helen we get back to you q dee dee when the president speak with the attorney general on sunday be it safe to assume that either she volunteer or he inquire about whether there wa a possible downside to increase pressure on the davidian m myer i think that they discuss the situation again i not go to get into the specific detail of what exactly she tell him but i think that he wa aware of the risk involve q dee dee the president yesterday morning say it wa entirely her decision she then say that she tell him what wa happen and he say okay do the president regard it that he give the go-ahead or that she give the go-ahead m myer i think what they both say yesterday wa that she make a decision base on all the available fact she inform him about that and he raise no objection again i do know how much clearer we can be about that q and he say okay the issue be over the responsibility m myer he say okay q do okay mean m myer the president accept ultimate responsibility q dee dee the president investigation that he go to announce would that be conduct by someone outside the administration m myer no q it would be internal be it mean to preclude any congressional investigation m myer no it mean simply to follow up on the incident that occur yesterday q and you would i assume therefore cooperate fully with any congressional hear that would be hold m myer to the best of my ability q dee dee there be two report out thi morning one that the justice department or fbi or whomever apparently have a bug plant inside the complex and the other be that the child may have be inject with some kind of poison that may have either leave them unconsciou or maybe even kill them before the fire what do you know about those two m myer nothing more than i see in news account thi morning we may get more on it later but at thi point i know i not sure anybody know any more than what wa report by person who come out of the compound q ha the president receive any report today in term of fatality and actually what wa go on what they be able to find out on in the compound now m myer he be brief i do think that they get into the compound yet they be still wait for it to cool off i do think there much beyond what be report in the news account but he ha be keep up-to-date on it q dee dee the president stand behind attorney general reno but do he feel that she perhap get bad advice from the so-called expert m myer he believe that she make he stand behind the decision that she make it wa the unanimou decision of her advisor of the fbi of the agent on the grind and he support that q what about the validity of the decision make on the grind do he back those m myer he not go to second-gues decision make q dee dee you just say he stand behind the decision which she make normally in a situation like thi the president say i make the decision but you say she make the decision m myer i say that the president wa brief about the decision he okay it and he accept full responsibility for it q but then why do you keep use the terminology the decision that she make rather than the decision that he make m myer because a he say yesterday she evaluate the fact base on evidence present to her by justice department and fbi which be part of the justice department and make a decision and then brief the president on that decision that be how the chain of command work she brief him he sign off on it the operation go forward and the president accept full responsibility q in that chain of command analogy there i want to go back to session a moment do you know if thi wa a plan that come through him to reno or wa it present to her around him or with hi involvement what wa hi involvement m myer again you have to go to the justice department for the specific interaction between the attorney general and the director q do the president stand behind director session m myer he support again i do know how many different way i can say thi he support the decision make by the justice department and the fbi he fully support the attorney general in thi i not step away from the director of the fbi i want to but janet reno be the one who brief him the one who make the decision a the head of the justice department a you know the director of the fbi report to the attorney general the attorney general make the decision she inform the president about those decision he okay it he do raise any objection to it and he accept full responsibility q do you have base on what you know here at the white house any concern about william session performance during thi m myer nothing to suggest that no q along those same line just in ymy initial review of the situation how much do you think the problem might have come from not have a justice department that fully staff and have an fbi director who be still quite uncertain about hi statu m myer i just do think that have anything to do with it i think the agent on the grind the operation go forward i not go to speculate on that q did the white house expres any alarm that janet reno choose to speak to the live network medium before she choose to speak to clinton m myer no she wa carry forward her responsibility to inform the public about the event of yesterday i think she do a very admirable job the president agree with that q before sunday how often wa the president brief on the situation in waco m myer he wa keep update on a regular basi on a daily basi q who brief the president m myer well i not go to get into exactly who what conversation he have with whom but he wa keep up-to-date on the event in waco he ha daily brief on a number of issue q no no wa thi a regular brief conduct by a white house staff person or wa it by a justice department person m myer he brief regularly by a white house staff on a number of issue again i not go to get into exactly who brief him on what subject q another subject q on another subject q now we go to do gay in the military laughter m myer i welcome it q how close be you to sign the biodiversity treaty m myer a you know the president give a speech on earth day tomorrow we have more to say about it then q any detail on where or when that speech be yet m myer it at and i do know where yet q dee dee be thi a major policy addres how would you characterize the speech tomorrow m myer i would characterize it a a earth day speech i would look for any major departure from hi past position on these thing but again i do want to get too much into what he go to talk about tomorrow q on or off campu q is thi at a location outside the white house m myer it will be somewhere in washington we do know exactly where yet q dee dee what foreign leader ha the president talk to since friday on the situation in bosnium m myer only prime minister major and again he try to reach president mitterrand again thi morning q david owen say yesterday and joe biden say today both of them agree that the peace proces be not go to work that the serb be not go to sign on do the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on m myer obviously the ultimate goal be some sort of peaceful resolution to the conflict in bosnium a you know the administration be consider a wide variety of option at thi point the situation there in and around srebrenica and the rest of eastern bosnium be quite seriou and the president will meet with hi bosnian advisor today and continue to pres forward on thi q is that a question they go to try to be decide whether or not the peace plan remain viable m myer again they be review a number of option include the peace plan q do the group that he meet with today include reg bartholomew m myer i do believe he here but it will be among the usual secretary christopher secretary aspin general powell q dee dee do you have anything on the apparent encounter by over bosnium today some aircraft violate the no-fly zone m myer no i do i get back to you on that q will the president be meet with every one of the leader come to town for the holocaust museum m myer he will he be meet a you know with vaclav havel today and with lech walesa tomorrow and then with the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon q a a group or one by one m myer i believe it a a group now havel and walesa ask for meet early and these have be on the agenda for quite some time but he will meet with all of the foreign head of state that be here q dee dee ha the president decide whether he support the gay and lesbian civil right act and ha anything be work out for him to addres the march on sunday m myer i think he probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march we have work out the exact detail of that q not a live phone hook-up m myer probably not give the logistic of get to boston the speech a you know be at the answer to the other part of ymy question be no he ha take a position on it q you say that speech in boston wa at m myer i believe so ye q do you know what it on m myer we still work out q general vessey come back tonight from vietnam when will he be meet with the president m myer no specific meet be schedule we talk to him at some point and see we look forward to hi report but exactly how he make that report be unclear q so he not go to come immediately to the white house m myer no q the aid czar how close be you m myer still work on it q drug czar q do you expect it before the march m myer i do have a time line on it q did the president ask senator mitchell to try the lloyd cutler ploy to break the filibuster m myer i do believe so q why not m myer he just not go to q are senate democrat here at thi hmy m myer no that tomorrow tomorrow at q update on the stimulu possible scale down m myer a you know the senate will vote on amendment today we continue to talk the president be commit to some kind of a job package we like to see it pass and we continue in conversation throughout the day and see where we end up q when thi brief be over can you give u word through the speaker or whatever whether the president talk to janet reno m myer we be happy to q it become a press question for the last several hour m myer no just thi minute that i be here and i have have a chance to follow up on it helen q do he have an opinion on hatfield m myer i mean obviously he prefer he offer a compromise package of billion he believe that that the best alternative believe that he obviously will to take a second look at the package and i think the senate will vote on that today and we hopeful that the president bill which will be the mitchell amendment will be the one that will be approve q dee dee be there any white house official that will be at the march on sunday m myer somebody will be there represent the president i do know who yet q well ha it be decide how he go to addres is it go to be a videotape or a phone call m myer i think it will probably be a letter but there ha be a final decision on that yet q the official will read the letter be that what it sound like m myer correct q lloyd bentsen come in here thi morning do you know what wa that about wa that about thi waco thing m myer no actually it wa it may have come up but it wa about economic issue q on health care be the of may still the target m myer that still the target q and there talk about a joint session of congres speech at the end of may m myer we have resolve exactly how the president will present the health care plan to the person i would rule that out a an option but no decision have be make edt
