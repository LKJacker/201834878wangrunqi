from mauser richard chandler subject re new study out on gay percentage from elf elf sternberg bzzzzt thank you for play but obviously you be not read the material a it be present according to the report i get in my hand the newsweek article which report that to percent of the population be gay use the criterium of no heterosexual contact in the past year but at the same time the university of denver study point out quite dramatically that of all self-identifying gay man have have some form of heterosexual contact in the past year i think the big mistake in that study must be that if one have have no sexual contact of any kind in the previou year they be count a heterosexual even if they do intend it that way that how the figure be be use
