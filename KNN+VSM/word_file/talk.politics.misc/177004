from julie julie kanga subject re top ten reason not to aid russian in article rcollin roger collin write julie julie kanga write i suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff yeltsin and hi person be say and compare that with the very anti-west slogan come from hi opponent in the russian congres i sure know who i want to back could we back him without force other to back him at the point of a gun if we have back him strongly early on i doubt there would be the problem there be now many russian become disillusion with democracy and reform when they felt rightly imo that the west do care yeltsin wa virtually promise massive aid once bush get over hi gorby-manium thi probably keep him from dismantle the congres and call for new election well the aid do come through and we do make sure it go to the proper place and now the anti-reformer be gain strength where before they be in hide have you consider a non-interventionist policy if market reform do happen russium will certainly get private capital at private risk to help their economy they will even have incentive to do so for the same reason if they do reform then my government will probably consider them enemy anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them if they do reform i do believe in give them money however i think thi be too important to take a non-interventionist approach thi be what really bug me about libertarianism it sound like all be the same in a hundred year time no need to do anything how do thi affect u well we be on the same planet and if vast track of europe be blow away i think we feel something a massive breakup of a country that span the planet be bind to have affect here of course there be also the humanitarian argument that democracy should help other democracy or struggle democracy if a billion gift wa that important to my well be could it be raise voluntarilly person already give over billion a year to charity despite the wish of libertarian thi society be a far way and get farther from be libertarian perhap voluntary gift would work if we have the proper framework but we do not have it we have to face the problem now not in x year when we have a libertarian dream society right now there be huge stumble block to trade let alone charity there be still limitation to high-tech export nasa ca buy proton launch vehicle from them sure the market may be able to help a great deal but it ca right now there be too many obstacle instead of fight against the aid you should be fight to tear down the obstacle the market and charity have to face seriously everyone ha different opinion on what be stupid my two cause be aid to russium and a strong space program someone else will champion welfare or education or do study of drunken goldfish that be why we have a republic and not a true democracy instead of gridlock on a massive scale we only have gridlock on a congressional scale it seem instead of gridlock on any scale we have aid to russium expensive space program national charity that do help the poor and probably study of drunken goldfish i think limit government be more key than how democratic it be well i think limit government be primarily democratic due to it be limit but the main question be how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely look like our btw sometime it seem that my government be try to go the opposite direction it be not go to be painles and not go to be easy we simply can not wait to help when they have the government they never get there without the aid it may be too late already btw who be to decide thi be just like those who want to impose their on other just the sort of thing i think libertarian be against that wa an opinion and libertarian be very big on free speech and i just excercising mine actually my politic be pretty libertarian except on thi one issue and thi be why it be impossible for me to join the party it seem that libertarian want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim if you be pretty libertarian except on thi one issue then you should be very libertarian consider it a compromise how much money would ymy fellow russia-aider have to give to russium if those you oppose be use the same government machine to steal money from you and ymy group for cause you do support a i also say above another problem i have be with transformation a libertarian society be not go to happen painlessly or overnight i have see nothing about how to take my current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace we could do that year ago but not now person have be say that for hundred of year they do have nuclear weapon year ago nor instantaneou communication nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in le than a day like it or not we be in the begin of a global economy and global decision make all the more reason to depend on the free market which can more efficiently proces information than to depend on ruler for decision on complex issue ye depend on the ruler of the free market and the business ruler do emerge somewhere and they will never represent the opinion of every person on the planet there must be check and balance check on the government when it get out of bind and check on industry when it get out of bind putting all ymy hope on the benevolence of the market be to me just like put all ymy hope on the benevolence of government julie disclaimer all opinion here belong to my cat and no one else
