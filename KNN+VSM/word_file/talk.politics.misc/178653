from jame p reynold subject he just do get it re will they ever learn in article techie william a bacon write they refuse to learn from history or from the present pointing to canada vaunt socialize medical care program he contend that it be fail even while the cost be catch up with angry taxpayer he note american do go to canada and elsewhere for medical care it the canadian and other who come here why should the united state duplicate what do work well in other country we have the world best medical care let not me it up with hillary clinton plan for socialize medicine john f mcmanu national president of the john birch society when mcmanu say we have the world best medical care i can hardly believe he refer to a system that cost u percent of my gdp while there be a single other country in the industrialize world that spend more than percent that leaf million of u with no coverage even though all the other system in the industrialize world cover virtually everyone yet american rank near the bottom of the list in term of life expectancy childhood immunization rate infant mortality and many preventable disease we pay on average about each for mri to put that in perspective they cost in japan the average u company spend over dollar a year per employee on health benefit seven hundred to be the range just about everywhere else how can anyone say that such a system be the best in the world the only thing the usa health care system be good at be shower well-insured patient with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharge for it and the private system of insurer and paperwork be so bloat and inefficient that it itself suck up over billion dollar a year in money from every other sector of society individual government and industry of the billion dollar american throw into the bottomles pit of health care cost last year the consumer union estimate that at least billion wa throw away on overprice useles and even downright harmful test and procedure and the most bureaucratic regulate insurance system in the world there be more than different private insurer in the usa but do the private competition stimulate more efficient paperwork ask any doctor who have to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all the competition among hospital be drive cost up not down the competition among hospital for both doctor and patient ha encourage the hospital to traffic in expensive superfluou equipment spending million on expensive machine of dubiou value that spend percent of the day idle be my idea of the world best health care system competition among specialist be drive them to perform dangerou and expensive procedure where they be very marginally helpful i especially think of heart surgery and some woman surgery like hysterectomy and cesarean section sound like the world best health care system ever notice how every time someone try to bring about some real change in health care the libby start bash canada system first of all hillary clinton be not advocate another canadian system i think that be make abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of month where do john f mcmanu get that idea anyway let say you a canadian live in a small town near the usa border ymy child need a complicate procedure only available in city hospital the nearest canadian city be hour west and hour east and there an american city one hmy south which way be you go to go is it because the american system be the best in the world or just for convenience it still amaze me that person ca seem to see more than just black and white on health care reform there be a million different way we ould restructure the system it not just a choice between total government control and total private control i wish the person scream socialize medicine every time soemone want to change the current syste would inform themself on health care issue the current system suck i want to keep provider private but that do change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we do reform the health care system purely private health care without any government intervention do work hillary clinton be not think of nationalize provider or evern insurer how can you scream socialize medicine at her program do you even know what you talk about ever see clinton graph of project deficit versu year for the rest of the decade notice how the line fall then start increase why i give you one wild gues a to which component of spend will overwhelm u if we do do something about it peope just do get it the current health care system be a cancer which be kill my economic well-being cost be still rise percent a year even a american by the ten of million go without or be force into managed-care program which be certainly pretty socialize already if you ask me a couple of month ago i post a message ask any hillary-basher to please come forward and present no gimmick straight talk just how they would set about keep cost down i do get a single answer the only thing i keep hear from libbie organization be pres release fill with evasive platitude like give health care back to the person just do you expect to do that without seriou reform what be it about the current system that you would change and how would that help how can anyone read the news live under my system and not see these fault how can we deal with the deficit my city my educational system my infrastrucure aid modernize my industry etc if we do quit throw away money which could be use to solve those problem america need health care reform now do just sit there and hillary-bash inform yourself jim reynold jame p reynold that jim to you and me
