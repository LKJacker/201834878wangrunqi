tie up and thu cut person off form the basic level of subsistance that the property owner must bribe the rest of u to respect their ownership right by provide alternative mean of subsistance when we be expect to give these peoperty owner let call them thieve bribe in order to be able to subsist then we have a sick situation the property owner be then parasite i want person to be able to live happy and prosperou life property owner can not maintain a monopoly in the free enterprise system unles they have help from a coercive government when a few land owner get together and try to control all the land without sell land price will go up at some point it will be to the advantage of the land owner to sell some of hi property trying to put a group of person to distribute land fairly would give them monopoly control over the land and would have the consequence you speak of let keep the land out of the grasp of a monopoly and let it exist in the free market it already in the hand of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism of land other than government land save for posterity and the eco-system a well a government function the remain land be own by a smaller percentage of the person than ever before the game of capitalism be almost win the game ha only to be declare over and we will have to take matter into my own hand and redistribute it again fairly or else be enslave in return for a place to live here in central californium already fewer than own all the property and of them own of it that twice what it wa twenty year ago rent be so high that you pay of ymy income for rent if you just have a mcjob all you can afford be one room if that some of minimum wage worker be homeles unles you both have degree in technical field and be work in them in the midst of unemployment in high tech job you will never own anything but a use car if you choose to have more than one child and everywhere else you could afford there be no job the only way to get there be to save and not consume any more than you have to clothe use food poor no movie no entertainment ect for about five to seven year and then if you save if you can get together that much and that ignore ymy kid and work two job then you can buy a home in arkansa or missourus outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year that an exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood line on other person house and find a sturdy hill then you can buy one up there also buy a rowboat missourus not so bad if you like the sensation of sleep in a sweatbox in summer and ymy car freeze solid in winter they really do put those heater into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to start with ether shit kill the rich and redistribute the livable property kill all of them rsw i want
