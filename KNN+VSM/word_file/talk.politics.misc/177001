from eric eric smith subject re hilter and homosexual cramer clayton cramer write eric eric smith write gsmith gene w smith write are you say that person vote for hitler and he become reich chancellor in good part because he use bully boy to attack communist hitler do not become become reich chancellor because person vote for him i not sure if you mean to imply that or not but i just think i bring that up hitler become chancellor because person vote for hi political party that not a huge difference in a parliamentary system ymy statement be a common misconception but it just be true in the german weimar system the chancellor wa not necessarily the leader of the largest reichstag party the chancellor wa appoint by the president and generally wa the leader of a coalition of party who could form an effective majority in the reichstag beyond that the implication that hitler rise to the chancellorship because a majority of german want nazi rule be false a well before president hindenburg appoint hitler chancellor in january the german person do not show a particular desire to be lead either by hitler or by the nazi party these be the result of the march election for president the closest hitler ever come to direct election hindenburg hitler thaelmann duesterberg in the runoff election in april the result be hindenburg hitler thaelmann so we can see that hitler personally wa support by only about a third of german voter similarly the nazi party never receive more than of the vote in reichstag election that occur in july in the november election the nazi lose two million vote and seat down from to out of the in the reichstag comparitively the socialist have and the communist the communist have gain seat and the german national party which have support the previou government have pick up a million of the nazi lose vote to gain seat up to i think the other large party wa the catholic center party i do know how many seat they have but i think they be decline and there be numerou other small party thu the nazi vote wa on the decline at the time hitler wa appoint chancellor what bring hitler to power wa not the demand of the german person for hitler or the nazi to run thing but the inability of the other party to put their difference behind them in favor of form an effective government for the country germany do not have an endure democratic tradition and their parliamentary system lack effective center party that favor the interest of the majority of the population instead what they have wa a number of small party who be unable to put aside their own specific objective in order to combine against the nazi who be out to end the democratic proces in fact part of the problem wa that some of the other party with substantial representation like the communist be also out to end the democratic proces but with different result in mind and generally do mind see parliamentary democracy go under germany have already have a non-nazi chancellor with a majority coalition for five month while the nazi have be the largest reichstag party and there certainly wa no danger of a revolution in favor of the nazi if anything the nazi be start to get desperate because they have fail to get enough support to make hitler president and their popular vote have begin to decline hitler wa not hindenburg first choice to be chancellor not even hi second choice first von papen have be chancellor since june after the november election when the nazi lose seat hindenburg first prevail on von papen to remain a chancellor but there be intrigue behind hi back and support for him wa lack so then hindenburg turn to von schleicher who become chancellor for two month eventually he too wa unable to hold together a work coalition of party to oppose the nazi who refuse to participate in any government that wa not lead by a nazi chancellor some of the nazi leadership particularly gregor strasser who wa the man in the party at the time want to participate in a coalition government but other know the party support wa wan figure that their best hope to gain power lay in undermine the democratic proces nevertheles the country wa govern for seven month by chancellor who be not nazi even though the nazi be the largest reichstag party the failure of these man to achieve a work coalition wa due to the inability of their coalition party to work together here how william shirer put it in the rise and fall of the third reich the cardinal error of the german who oppose nazism wa their failure to unite against it at the crest of their popular strength in july the national socialist have attain but percent of the vote but the percent of the german person who express their opposition to hitler be much too divide and shortsighted to combine against a common danger which they must have know would overwhelm them unles they unite however temporarily to stamp it out true the german person support hitler after he become chancellor but that do change the fact that there wa not overwhelm support for him before he wa in power the german person be not cry out for hitler to take over no matter how bad economic condition be the leftist party probably have more support in total than the nazi hitler use the fact that other be passively or actively will to see the government paralyze a a mean to take it over eric smith eric eric cus
