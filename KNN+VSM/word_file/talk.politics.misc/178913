from phil phil ronzone subject re freedom of association in article paul bartholomew write a very well put together post i disagree with several key point but the post be an excellent one with which to engage in discourse there ha be much discussion recently about the right to freedom of association mr cramer and mr ronzone appear to take an absolutist position on thi right that it be a fundamental human right perhap the fundamental human right and that it supersede other right such a the right to an equal opportunity other feel that a right to an equal opportunity outweigh the right to freedom of association and thu we have the never-ending debate that flare up repeatedly freedom of association foa involf the mutual and voluntary agreement of two or more person right to equal opportunity let call it reo involf coercion in all case by definition a major problem be that neither of these right be explicitly declare or protect in the constitution or in the declaration of independence although both can be derive from these document unfortunately thi mean that the debate will never end because neither side can conclu sively prove the validity of their view it become solely a matter of personal philosophy ye there be much debate but no it can end with once and for all recognition of these right well not totally perfect end but end in the same way that there be no worldwide disagreement that say murder be a crime my personal opinion be that the real answer ly somewhere in between i regard both of these right a fundamental human right which unfortu nately come into direct conflict with one another which be stronger depend on the give situation hmm there be even more discusion about religion should we take a somewhere in between approach toward the state a state recognize religion the first amendment be so uh so absolutist you know for example if the owner of a mom-and-pop store wish to hire an employee to help out their right to freedom of association outweigh the right of their job applicant to an equal opportunity they should be free to hire whomever they choose use whatever criterium they choose without any government intervention at all similarly if a family wish to rent out a bedroom in their home or a garage apartment or something similar then their right to freedom of association outweigh the right of their prospective tenant to an equal opportunity if on the other hand ibm a multi-national corporation with employee publicly own and operate by a board of director wish to hire additional employee then whose freedom of association be we protect the board of director the other employee the owner of the stock in thi case the applicant right to an equal opportunity outweigh the right to freedom of association and we a a society can ask ibm to use only those criterium which be relevant to the specific task why say who why can mon pop have foa but ibm be force and force be the correct word here to have reo a purchase of ibm be voluntary then there be very well define procedure on how ibm choose to do some thing and choose to do other thing why not let those same procedure work for employment policy similarly if a landlord own a number of apartment build in which he do not live and which be manage by an independent management agency then whose freedom of association be we protect if the owner do not live in hi build and ha no contact with hi tenant then the prospective tenant right to an equal opportunity outweigh the right to freedom of association and we a a society can ask the owner to use only those criterium which be relevant to good tenant i put good in quotation mark because i really do want to be draw off into the side issue of what constitute a good tenant why do thi tenant have an option i wo call it a right to destroy the foa of the landlord if the landlord and the tenant ca agree then they both can cease from use each other property suddenly by arm wave by magic a landlord do not have foa and on what basi do the foa of the landlord disappear it seem that vague term like no contact with tenant suffice well i think foa be one my most important rightt in the top and by golly if the state be go to make it suffer i sure would like to see the heinou crime that justify the removal of thi right i do think no contact with the tenat be even a crime much le something that should cause severe interference with important right i suspect that the majority of the person in thi country agree with my position on these extreme case particularly if they be present in thi manner i do know if mr ronzone or mr cramer would agree i suspect not in any case additional problem arise when we try to apply guideline for the middle grind what if the company ha employee or or where do we draw the line between protect the right to freedom of association and protect the right to an equal opportunity right be not define by choice foa be an absolute reo be a fancy name for thuggery for racism and coercion the difficulty be that any line we draw will of necessity be artificial and any legislation result will be flaw in the past the government ha usually try to pa law which refer to the number of employee hire by the company any company with more than xxx employee wa affect by the law those with fewer be unaffected of course it would be you dimly see that the line must be artifiacial because foa be the only right just like a state religion you ca jsutify that either generally i believe that if we do not have any regulation affect these right then the right to freedom of association will be stronger on the other hand many of the regulation protect the right to an equal opportunity too much weaken the right to freedom of association i do believe there be a satisfactory solution which will please everybody a solution that i come up with be to use publicly own v privately own a the divide line if the company remain privately own then the owner should be free to do whatever they want with their company if the company become publicly own then the public ha a right to ask the company to submit to additional regulation why i assume that when you say publicly own you be talk about those quasi-state company that do not have shareholder the company on the fortune for example be all privately own they can give you a list of all of their owner they have no anonymou unknown to them owner by the way the above analysi be base on the assumption that the right to freedom of association and the right to an equal opportunity be both fundamental human right of equal importance since thi be entirely a matter of faith not subject to any proof i do not choose to even try to establish thi you either accept it or you do any comment foa can be derive by any two rational person on a basi that neither ha evil maliciou or murderou intent toward the other in short agreement be mutual or not at all ymy reo on the other hand life only by accept coercion the gun into the situation and that be self-destructive of the whole argument because it be base only on might make right sort of like say nobody ha a right to live whereupon i whip out a gun and shoot you dead end of argument there be actually person that still believe love canal wa some kind of environmental disaster weird eh these opinion be mine and you ca have but i rent cheap
