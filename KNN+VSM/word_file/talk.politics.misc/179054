from clinton-hq the white house subject clinton am pres briefing by dee dee myer the white house office of the pres secretary for immediate release april pres briefing by dee dee myer the briefing room edt m myer at we have a pres conference bill in the east room and then saturday the president will leave here at roughly and fly down to jamestown he will spend the day there overnight at camp david on sunday it unclear exactly what time he leave camp david and fly to boston he leave from hagerstown the pres plane will leave from washington he will meet with some q what kind of a plane be that he take m myer that he take he probably take a c q from hagerstown m myer from hagerstown air force one do fly out of hagerstown apparently q how will the pool travel m myer the pool will have to meet him ahead of time so i gues the pool will travel with the pres plane and wait for him at the airport there be currently no provision and i double-check because there currently no provision i think that standard operate practice q the pool be not go to meet him and watch him get on the plane at hagerstown m myer i do believe so q what time do he have to be in boston m myer he go to meet there with a group of citizen mostly person who support u during the campaign at around we still work out the final time q at the airport m myer no it will be at the boston harbor hotel and then he will also meet with some a youth group that author something call project the speech to the publisher be actually at it will be follow by q a and then after the speech and q a he attend a reception with the publisher and then return to washington from boston and that it for the weekend q ha the president see the report from or the letter communication from the foreign service officer also obviously the communication from madeleine albright and what be hi reaction to their call on him m myer well obviously the letter wa write to secretary christopher i believe secretary christopher receive the letter on saturday he review it and meet with the author on monday to discus their view he believe it an important part of the policy-making proces and be take their view into account a we go forward in the development of the bosnium policy q what be the president reaction m myer the president ha see the letter it wa something that wa direct toward secretary christopher in term of he ha see specifically the letter but in term of their concern generally what the president ha say be that there be a lot of option on the table now include one that be there before and i think he a be everybody gravely concern about the situation in bosnium q is he influence by that i mean how do he feel about the fact that all of the specialist in that area those desk officer m myer many of the specialist in that area i think that that be clearly part of the proces it something their view will clearly be consider i think secretary christopher meet with the group immediately to discus their view i think he believe that there ought to be room for opinion and that those opinion ought to be consider particularly from person who work closely on the issue q what do you mean there be option on the table that be there before m myer i think the president say last week that there be option such a lift the arm embargo to the bosnian muslim that have be previously off the table that be now be consider q dee dee in term of those option madeleine albright be say that potentially there could be unilateral action by the if the european do not go along is that on the table m myer well i ca discus anything that would any conversation that would have happen between ambassador albright and the president but i think the president ha say he would certainly be work with my european ally he have a number of conversation with european leader and be try to build some consensu there q will he reach a decision will he have anything specific to say today m myer no i mean in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today q do ymy statement mean he ha rule out unilateral action m myer he continue to consult with my ally at thi point he ha say i think he be fairly clear about it that the he believe that the need to act in concert with it ally on thi q on that point do he believe that the though do have built-in authority from the united nation already to take unilateral action m myer well i think the resolution make it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort i think the broader point be that anything we do any option that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it be consistent with authority and if it not we work with my ally to make sure that we get it q dee dee then how do the white house someone a distinguish a elie wiesel who say that not enough be be do to stop the atrocity go on in bosnium m myer i think that that why we consider additional option i think that mr wiesel comment yesterday be quite compel the situation in bosnium be tragic the president be very concern about it he ha i think president clinton ha work very hard to take further action to continue to isolate serbium in the world community clearly we consider other option because the president be concern that perhap it not enough q in term of what you be just talk about it sound like resolution justify unilateral action by the to protect humanitarian m myer i do think it i would use the word justify it permit unilateral action by any country in protect the delivery of humanitarian relief but i think that just an explanation of the resolution i think any action that we take will be consistent with resolution or we work with my ally to make sure that it be permissible or we get further action q the president and other official have rule out unilateral action in bosnium in the past you decline to do that thi morning m myer no i say the president ha say repeatedly that he want to act in concert with my ally on thi q that do mean that he wo act alone which ha be say before explicitly m myer i do mean to imply a change in policy the president ha say all along that he want to act in concert with my ally on thi q one other little question did he know about thi letter from the foreign service officer before it hit the paper m myer i do believe so secretary christopher they may have have a private conversation about it the president ha not see it q they meet on monday right christopher meet surely he must have bring that up m myer again they may have talk privately about it but q dee dee what you say be that the albright recommendation ha be reject be that correct m myer no i do say that at all i say i wo i say i would comment on any conversation or communication q she advocate unilateral action and you say in effect that we will not take unilateral action m myer i be not confirm anything that madeleine albright may or may not have recommend q given the sometime delicate complicate and frustrate nature of negotiation with the ally on thi issue do the president find thi kind of letter from foreign service officer of the state department helpful to that proces hurtful to that m myer i think that their view be obviously be consider the secretary receive that memo on saturday and two day later he meet with them in order to have a more thorough air of their view of the basi for their view to discus in greater detail the option that they have present in the letter q do it put some kind of pressure on additional pressure on him now from within hi own administration to act regardles of what the ally may or may not do m myer i think clearly there a broad policy review underway now and the president and hi advisor be consider a number of option include some of those outline in the letter from the folk over at the state department now no decision have be make on that yet but i think that there be a through review underway and that their opinion be be very seriously consider q if i can just follow up i gues what i look for be what wa hi reaction to thi letter did he say good thi bolster my position or do he say damn thi be just what i do need right now m myer i think he say thi help contribute substantively to the debate it important that all view be consider and air thoroughly that before he make a decision he want to have the best possible advice and information possible and thi i think in many way further that goal q so internal advice to a cabinet official or the president it all open now and you would take any umbrage or say that they be out of line m myer i think that the fact that secretary christopher meet with them to discus their view and make sure they have an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it be conclusive evidence that their view be welcome q do the policy review include what madeleine albright ha suggest and what joe biden and other have suggest which be that the previou resolution authorize unilateral action military action for the delivery of humanitarian m myer i think all option be on the table q the unilateral option be on the table m myer i think all option be on the table q we have two different q is that a change dee dee q that would be a change of policy q particularly if it include grind troop which ha be specifically rule out m myer i think the president ha be well no i do that be not q are you talk about all option m myer all option i think the president ha be fairly clear about that so let me just review again what he ha say he ha say that the president ha say all option be on the table with the exception of the introduction of grind troop which he ha never suggest he ha rule that out from the begin q ha he rule out unilateral action of any sort m myer he ha say that he do believe the can solve the problem in the former yugoslavium by itself i think that there be a number of very complicate option on the table right now i do think that again i do want to comment on specific option that be be consider other than in the broad category that we already say thing like lift the arm embargo against the bosnian muslim thing that i think we talk about in broad term thi be a very complicate situation the option be present and consider be very complicate q air strike on the table m myer again i think that be fairly clearly point out that that something that be discuss q dee dee be grind troop on the m myer no grind troop be not be consider q you say there wa not go to be you say you be not announce a change of policy then you say everything be on the table we confuse are unilateral action on the table m myer all i can tell you be what the president ha say that he do believe that he want to act in concert with the ally on thi q want to but he will to i mean if they do go along m myer he continue to consult with my ally on thi he continue to have discussion he continue to pres them for further action and i think that clear the conversation be ongoing we go to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on thi q dee dee the ally have take the position that to conduct any kind of air strike in bosnium would have the opposite effect of ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid that they feel that their troop on the grind monitor the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the bosnian m myer i not sure that the consistent i mean i not sure who you refer to q the british and the french q ye the british and french they take the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardize by any kind of air strike against the bosnian military do the believe differently from that m myer the president ha have conversation with both mitterrand and major a you know i think that there be a thorough review of policy go on in those country a well and i do want to comment on the nature of the president discussion other than to say that he continue to consult with my ally a we move forward and he continue to pres them for further action and i think that proces be ongoing q the other day vote against any military intervention yesterday do the president regard that a the end of the line or do he do still hold out some possibility of unilateral action the ally have be very very plain that they do not want to do anything m myer the consultation be ongoing that all i can tell you at thi point q are you say that there wo be any announcement on bosnium today in the pres conference m myer no that be not the intention of the pres conference q what be the intention m myer it an opportunity to take question he may have a brief i sure he have a brief open statement but it be not an opportunity to outline a new policy on bosnium that will not happen q can you tell u what the subject of the open statement be m myer it sort of a general statement of where we be q after the first hundred day you mean m myer it not a long statement i mean thi be just generally do look for any major policy pronouncement q do you know what the open statement be m myer but it perhap later today i be able to tell you with more certainty i think that still under review but the override purpose of thi it not a mystery it not mean to be it just to take question q it would be helpful to know whether what the open statement be on m myer since the major purpose here be just to take question it not completely resolve yet q dee dee one policy that wa expect last week and that the white house you and george seem to indicate we might get would be an aid czar will he announce that today and what the delay on that m myer i do think we mean to imply i think we say it would happen soon i do think we mean to imply with any certainty that it would be thi week it be come soon i do anticipate that happen today q what the delay is thi the perfect time to announce an aid czar m myer i do know that it a delay i think the proces be ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background check and to make sure that we cross the t and dot the i before we make an announcement q dee dee what be zoe baird qualification for the foreign intelligence advisory board and why wa her appointment announce here m myer the qualification i do know if there a specific list i have to check and see i think there be a number of person there on the board with different background many of them have long history in intelligence or other government service i think there a broad variety of view acros political spectrum and acros background that be represent there we never make a formal announcement other than the chairman of the board which be admiral william crowe q why would he appoint her though if the american person and many in the senate reject her for another government job m myer i do believe that the american person ever have vote on her and i certainly she wa never reject in the senate she never go up there for a hear but the president believe she a very competent person he say that zoe baird do you understand what the question be zoe baird be on the president foreign intelligence q you say she never go up there for a hear q her nomination wa withdraw after public outrage over violate federal law m myer right she never she wa never but you say she wa reject by the senate i wa just simply try to point out that she wa never vote on by the senate q so you do think that be any problem m myer i do think there any problem q she ha be appoint to thi board be that a fact m myer ye q do she need confirmation for thi do she need confirmation to be a member of the m myer no it a presidential appointment q usually announcement be make here at the white house wa there a decision not to announce her publicly m myer we do make an announcement person who ask be tell who the member of the board be we do make an official announcement if anybody interest in that we can certainly put out the list of name q i like to know q do such board member do you normally a a matter of routinely put out release on all these board and presidential appointment regardles of their dimension m myer not alway but again i happy to put thi out q is that the standard practice q that wa past practice m myer again i happy to put it out we put out a list of the member of the board today q dee dee i do want to try to fail to let you get out of thi swamp but laughter all i really want to know be ha it be the practice in thi administration for such announcement to be make routinely m myer i think generally but not alway and we happy to put that out today q what be the board what be her title what be the size of the board m myer there be roughly a dozen member on the board it be a civilian board although their be some obviously retire military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the president again the chairman of that board be admiral william crowe q and do he recommend baird q what the name of the board m myer it the president foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab q what her qualification that she have employ an illegal alien is that laughter m myer do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke q let me phrase it another way why should thi appointment be view a a pay-back for the difficulty she have a couple of month ago m myer because it not q what her experience in foreign intelligence m myer she an experience attorney someone who the president believe be very competent and qualify and i think part of the mission of thi board be to provide civilian input not everybody on the board be suppose to be an intelligence expert that be not the board mission it be to provide civilian input for the president a he make decision regard intelligence matter he believe she very qualify very competent person enormously talented and ha say that throughout q is thi just a figment of my overactive imagination or wa there discussion early on about abolish the president foreign intelligence advisory board m myer i do think so on december when he announce all of hi foreign policy advisor he announce that he would have appoint admiral crowe a the head of the board so i do believe there ever be any q earlier than that during the transition m myer no i do believe so it wa announce again on december admiral crowe could be there but it wa announce q are member pay m myer i do believe so but i double-check q on another subject on waco how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal report of the autopsy of the body that be come out of waco and the state i gues it the texa ranger report m myer most of the information be come the federal information be come from the site clearly there be some discrepancy and the justice department be look into it official in the justice department be tell i believe the day before yesterday that there be several body find with bullet hole i think there some discrepancy about that and the justice department be look into it q is the president go to get involve in try to sort out what seem to be become a jurisdictional moras down there with some person withdraw other say they in charge but other justice fbi texa ranger all grab a piece of thi m myer i do know that he go to try to mediate the dispute i mean i let you know if there anything he intend to do about it but a you know there be several level of investigation ongoing and we hopeful that they can work together q is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything m myer i do know i have to get back to you on that q what be the subject matter of sunday speech m myer it go to be fairly general i do think it go to be any specific announcement i think it go to be sort of a q do he have a topic that he go to talk about m myer we still work on it but i would look for any announcement of like the drug czar or something like that q is it sort of a day speech sort of my excellent adventure for day laughter m myer not exactly but i think he take a little bite broader look about what happen in the last q foreign domestic m myer a little bite of both but i think a lot of domestic q and overview m myer ye more of an overview than a specific policy announcement q ha there be an agreement yet on a forum by which the president will addres the gay right march on sunday m myer it will be a letter read to the crowd by congresswoman nancy pelosi q is that available m myer not yet but it will be sure q are you go to put it out here or m myer we probably put it out here on sunday q travel next week m myer unclear q what wa the question q likely m myer i do q likely possible m myer possible q what possible m myer travel q george mention yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposal next week do you have day yet for them m myer not yet q can you tell u which order m myer campaign finance reform first national service later in the week q is there any coverage tomorrow in williamsburg m myer no q and any report in the aftermath of the day m myer any readout from the day q readout m myer it possible jeff eller will be down there i think he can go through what the president do during the day we do expect any photo op or anything other than departure here in the morning q dee dee the president ha not make a regular practice a some of hi predecessor have of go to camp david in fact he be there what once or twice m myer twice q why thi weekend m myer he go two weekend ago a you know on the way home from hi father-in-law funeral i think that they find it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together a a family and thi be just an opportunity to do the same q there no march there q it ha nothing to do with the march here m myer no q since he go to be in town sunday morning now instead of in jamestown have you think about him make a quick pas-by fly-over laughter m myer he fly straight to boston q flying straight do you say laughter q george take a question yesterday on waco the president have say on tuesday in the rose garden that there wa a minor disagreement on tactic between the military advisor and the fbi and the question wa whether you know exactly what that wa and whether it relate to the use of the particular kind of tear ga do you have an answer on that m myer i do i check the pres thank you edt
