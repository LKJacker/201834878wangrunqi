from mike white subject re expen ive motorola handheld radio for peanut write i can no longer use anything japanese kenwood yeasu icom alinco it all junk well i not sure i go quite that far but i agree that motorola gear be of better quality the question be how much that quality be worth to a ham in amateur service not commercial service thi radio can hear a repeater that mile away without an antenna ok great but how often do that come up how good be good enough and how much be someone will to pay for it a good ham-quality ht be maybe while a commercial quality one be maybe is the increase reliability and performance worth time the price in amateur service only the individual involve can answer that question and each ham ha to decide for if motorola quality be worth time the price to you then more power to ya but i amaze that folk make that choice for me give that i get to spend pick the yaesu ht and a nice new hf rig every time over a motorola ht alone no matter how good it be to me ham-quality gear be good enough to each hi own mike these be my opinion only
