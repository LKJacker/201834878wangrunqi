drive will be include meg sony scsi hard drive sony model the drive mechanism be completely trash thi hard drive wa in my computer mac se and have a stiction problem well repeat bang on the side of the computer result in a head crash ye metal scrap metal which wa not too pleasant to listen to still the scsi controller card be in good work order and can be use for part or a project meg seagate hh scsi hard drive model i originally buy thi drive because it have a small stiction problem and i though that i could fix it well i determine that the drive mechanism wa fine and that it wa a controller problem motor controller wa send proper signal well after take the controller off the drive look at it and put it back together i realize that i accidentally sever one of the small flat cable that connect the drive to the controller i try to solder it but i not that good at solder so i could do it worked perfectly before i mess up i use it a a temporary drive when the sony above crash on me also load the drive with about twenty mac application worth well over clari cad m word think c excel and many other i think all it need be a resoldering of that cable you also get all the software on the drive if you can accept be a pirate i only ask that you delete my datum file from the drive i wa really angry when i break that connection and then could fix it i just do have time to play with it

test thi one out yet but if anyone be interest i will get it test out to make sure that it work i have trouble use it with my accelerator board but then i speak to the manufacturer of the board and

panasonic model number agg there also another number on it toshiba model number virtually identical to the one above each drive drive these thing be proprietary so i ca test it but i think it work not
