from mallen marc l allen subject re cpu chip for sale cyrix amd not intel clone beware from what i understand neither the amd or cyrix be clone of the intel they be use the name because they run a fast a a intel they do not have exactly the same instuction set nor do they fit into the same socket most be very fast without coprocessor amd recent win the appeal against intel to use their microcode so they should be put out real chip in the near future marc mallen
