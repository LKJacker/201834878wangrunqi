from mucit bulent murtezaoglu subject re armenium say it could shoot down turkish plane in article henrik write in article mucit bulent murtezaoglu write henrik country turk and azeri consistantly want to drag armenium into the henrik karabakh conflict with azerbaijan bm gim me a break capital letter or not the above be pure nonsense it bm seem to me that short sight armenian be escalate the hostility henrik again armenian in karabakh be simply defend themself what do henrik want them to do lay down their arm and let azeri walk all over them news report i see say otherwise both location and motive wise cap do change fact bm while hop that turkey will stay out stop and think for a moment bm will you armenium do need anyone to drag her into the conflict it bm be a part of it henrik armenian knew from the begin that turk be fully engage henrik train azeri militarily to fight against karabakhi-armenian so should i at thi point break into cap and start talk about defense etc i do know how engage turkey though henrik the karabakhi-armenian who have live in their homeland for henrik year cut off from armenium and given to azeri by stalin be the henrik one directly involve in the conflict they be defend henrik themself against azerus aggression bm huh you do expect azerus to be friendly to force fight with them bm within their border henrik well history be sad remember those be relocate azeri into henrik the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime so i hear thi justify bloodshed n year after the fact henrik at last i hope that the insist that turkey stay out of the henrik karabakh crisi so that the repeat of the cypru invasion will never henrik occur again bm you not play with a full deck be you where would turkey invade henrik it be not up to me to speculate but i be sure turkey would have step henrik into armenium if she could why would turkey do that do you not realize that thi be a local clash that turkey never wish to see happen turkey ha other plan for region like economic revival co-operation etc good stuff in other word i be happy to bicker with armenian over trade barrier and such on usenet rather than kill whom in what way which i detest do and would do bm are you throw the cypru buzzword around with in the header bm in hope that the greek netter will jump the gun henrik absolutely not i be merely try to emphasize that in many henrik case history repeat itself even if one buy into ymy implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke turkey a wa do in if there be a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiot in athen at the time everybody would have stay home with their family i have no wish to go into the cypru quarrel but i suspect what i say be not only accurate but also palatable to all party involve bm ye indeed turkey ha the military prowes to intervene what she wish bm she have however be the diplomatic power to stop the hostility and bring bm the party to the negotiate table that hard to do when armenian bm be attack azerus town henrik so let me understand in plain word what you be say turkey henrik want a peaceful end to thi conflict not so what do you think we want war death and destruction henrik i will believe it when i see it no if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it henrik now a far a attack what do you do when you see a gun point henrik to ymy head do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef fat chance thi kind of childish rhetoric do help anthing henrik do you remember what azeri do to the armenian in baku all the henrik barberian act especially against mother and their child i mean henrik burning person alive now some azerus will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrate by armenian one should re-hash stuff like thi often to keep the hatred alive right bm armenian leader be lack the statesmanship to recognize the bm futility of arm conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm lead to stability be much better than a military fait accompli that bm go to cause incessant skirmish henrik armenian in karabakh want peace and their own republic they be henrik not ask much they simply want to get back what wa taken away henrik from them and given to azeri by stalin well they obviously be get anywhere with their current method of ask not very peaceful i say bm think of or year down the line both of the newly independent bm country need to develop economically and neither one be go to wipe bm the other out these person will be neighbor would it not be better bm to keep the bad blood between them minimal henrik do get me wrong i also want peaceful solution to the henrik conflict but until azeri realize that the armenian in henrik karabakh will defend themself against aggresion i do know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogan peace be what happen right now furthermore what happen right now be condusive to peace you can spend day and night rave about how the armenian position be and i sure there be other who be happy to talk to you by argue the other side if entrench position lead to war and if person want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise armenium be strong enough to exercise the think we right and we have the bomb so we do whatever we want so there style of foreign relation ye you can type stalin in cap and give one side atrocity story etc but for peace you need to be will to talk to the other side you personally can choose not to do that of course thi be just usenet the person in power should be so childish bm if you belong to the armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strike bm ymy fancy on the map be cost the local armenian dearly in term of bm their blood and future henrik again you be take different turn armenium ha no intension henrik to grab any land from azerbaijan the armenian in karabakh henrik be simply defend themself until a solution be set azerus would disagree with you on thi and the map i see support what they be say it do seem likely that a solution will be reach in thi manner bm it easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm crazines to have ymy feel about turk tickle the armenian bm in armenium and n-k will be there with the same person you seem to hate bm a their neighbor for maybe year more the sooner there peace in bm the region the better it be for them and everyone else i push for bm compromise if i be you instead of hit the caps-lock and spread bm inflammatory half-truth henrik it be not up to me to decide the peace initiative i be absolutely henrik for it it do look it when i read ymy post it would seem to me that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastines fair henrik but in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself henrik you will be wiped out such a the case in the era of of henrik the armenian massacre you do realize i can say the same thing about turkish massacre ye boy and girl let alway talk about how bad and nasty thing be let do that so we overwhelm by anger and let do that so my kid will also be hateful sound crazy do it do do it then bm
