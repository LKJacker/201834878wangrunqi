from aap alberto adolfo pinka subject re israel an apartheid state in article perlman eric s perlman write in article aap alberto adolfo pinka write i do not want to convince anyone thi be just usenet not the real world i just read the opinion other have about a subject and sometime i present my opinion i think that thi net be only useful to exchange idea i never want nor i want now to convince anyone of anything fine now if ymy opinion be convince anyone and it get refute regularly by the fact which be the case be it likely that ymy opinion need some revision a i say i do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinion convince anyone i do not believe that my opinion be refute by fact first and i repeat it i never say that the idea of jew have the right to have a state be racist zionism a a movement be more than just that idea in a word utter and complete horse puckey look the term up in the dictionary maybe youy view of a dictionary be the problem here one thing be the accept mean of a word by a dictionary and sometime a completely different thing be what that word come to mean after a long time i think that zionism in the way it define who be a jew for example be racist-like ok now how would you define it and by the way you wrong again there be no uniformity of thi definition among zionist movement you know thi be the case it be point out on the net directly to you before and yet you continue to maintain thi delusion ok tell me how many person in zionist movement define a jew in a different way and how many be who define jew base on a religiou way in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do not support the bomb and kill of the ira i believe that jew have a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism a it be right now comparing the action of israel to that of the ira be like compare those of the u to those of chile under pinochet for example with the ira in the role of pinochet you really need to get ymy history straight you also need a basic dictionary you need to start read before answer my point wa that because some movement claim to be nationalistic it do not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic i do not comapre israel to the ira i think that you be start to put word on my mouth and that be wrong stuff delete by pinka hi statement which i wa respond to with the below assert that zionism wa uniform and monolithic i never say that zionism be monolithic if you be go to attribute me thing present the quote where i say that that be what make the basi for zionist movement however i be not consider just that but the rest of it in a word i do believe you ymy word tell a very different story especially since they be not base on fact but innuendo and misrepresentation that be ymy problem i could certainly interpret thi like you be run out of argument first you put word in my mouth now you say you do ot believe me which make an interest point person live in a jewish state have show that jewish culture include in it jewish religion but they be not the same so the jewish person live in the jewish state have show u that there be some problem in a state where of the person be secular but judaism be define accord to religiou standard or where marriage be a religiou stage or where the law of return define a jew accord to a religiou standard no it do nowhere do the law of return demand that one must be religiou or even believe in g-d to become a citizen of israel thereunder why do you try read for a change did i say that the law of return demand a person to be religiou now how do the law of return define who be a jew and who be not i say that it use a religiou standard if ymy mother be a jew you be a jew if ymy mother be not jewish neither you be do not twist my word please true there be debate in israel and abroad about who be a jew but those debate be take up by both religiou and secular would you say that religiou person should not have a say in that would you deny them their right of free speech i be not talk about the debate i be talk about how thing be right now when the debate be over i see what happen right now thing be like they be let me ask you one thing i understand that israel differenciate between citizenship and nationality suppose m ale and f emale have a child in israel which nationality will the child id show accord to each one of the follow case a f and m be both jewish b f be jewsh and m be not c f be muslim and m be jewish d f be christian and m be jewish e f and m be both non-jewish did those israeli who do not believe in god and will never do become non-jew why should they still define then a jew base on what be a religiou definition it call history how do you think jew stick together through pogrom for millenium in europe we have to know who wa my own i for one do think that some change be in order and that patrilineal descent be no le legit than be matrilineal which be not the religiou jew point of view there plenty of room for that in zionism a you well know it call history at some point it wa ok now i believe it be not according to webster ninth new collegiate dictionary merriam-webster inc publisher springfield massachusett page hy-poc-ri-sy a feign to be what one be nnot or to believe one do not so say that one believe in zionism a a simple matter of person have the right to nationalism but disregard the right of the palestinian person to do the same accord to thi dictionary be hypocrisy utter baloney by the way i do believe the palestinian have a right to self-determination have state so on thi net and i know you see it interesting how do you know had i ever talk to you about thi and forget about that but that right to self-determination can not be at israel expense israel security come first and that security must be maintain you also twist word now beyond belief if you think that what that definition mean in thi context you need a first-grade course in english which definition be you now talk here about i do not know why you be so touchy i never say that you do not support palestinian self-determination i just give an example of hypocrisy i never say that someone in thi net be guilty of it it wa just an example nothing more nothing le than that why do you have to clarify what you think if you do use different mean of word than be in the dictionary you might be believable here you have several problem first you should know that word have more mean than those give in the dictionary second it may come to be a shock for you to know that there be more word than those in the dictionary third we can exchange idea if you want but you come out with thi nonsense about be believable use the definition give in a dictionary it seem that you can not answer to the idea give by other without insult other sad if ymy fact at all resemble even the slightest bite of truth which they do not you might be believable if you do not put word in my mouth it might be that you might start read what i have actually say so far you come over and over twist what i say or present thing i never say a if i have say them in thi way you be answer to yourself that be why you do not find it believable maybe if you start read what i have actually say and not what you add you might change ymy mind but the fact be that there be nothing resemble fact in what you say on thi thread and the fact also be that you use different definition for ymy word base on baloney than anyone else do first there be nothing resemble a fact in what you add to what i say a if i have say it seconf anyone else be suppose to mean than i do eric s perlman perlman center for astrophysic and space astronomy university of colorado boulder aap
