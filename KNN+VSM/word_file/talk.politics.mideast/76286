from mark ira kaufman subject the israeli pres andy beyer ha claim that the israeli pres be a bite bias but the fact be that there be event shape the politic of the mideast that person who do not read the israeli pres simply know nothing about many of these event be not even mention here i read the israeli pres to learn of important event about which you know nothing because of ymy total reliance on western medium for ymy information on israel since i read both american medium and israeli medium i can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the american pres for knowledge about israel do not have a true picture of what be go on a to the claim that israeli paper be bias of course they be some may lean to the right or the leave just like the medium here in america but they still report event about which person here know nothing i choose to form my opinion about israel and the mideast base on more knowledge than do an average american who rely exclusively on an american medium which do not report on event in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy
