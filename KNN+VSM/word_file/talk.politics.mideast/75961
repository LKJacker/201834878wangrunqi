from basil hamdan subject re wa go hezbollah i will try to answer some of dorin question even though they be not address to me specifically but i feel that i be a bite concern by the thread since i be a southern lebanese from a village that be often on the receive end of israel bomb in the first place the death of three soldier on a patrol in occupy lebanese terrritory be not an act of terrorism or murder it be disingeneou to compare their death to that of athlete in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder thi exercise be aim solely at divert the issue and be far from the truth it seem to me dorin that you be so remote and ignorant of the problem on the grind that ymy comment can only be charactrized a irrelevant and heavily color by the preconception and misinformation i will try to paint the most accurate picture i can of what the situation really be in south lebanon in article stssdxb dorin baru write is there any israeli a civilian in ymy opinion now i do not condone myself bomb village any kind of village but you claim these be village with civilian and iraeli claim they be camp fill with terrorist you claim that israeli shell the village with the of find a terrorist or so if they kill one fine if not too bad civilian die right i be not so sure i be i wa back in my home village thi last summer for ymy information we be person not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorist most of the person in my village be regular inhabitant that go about their daily busines some work in the field some own small shop other be older man that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee is that so hard to imagine it be not a terrorist camp a you and the israeli like to view the village they be small community with kid play soccer in the street woman prepare lunch man play card etc some young man usually age between to year be member of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitant of the village do not know who these be they be secretive about it but most person often suspect who they be and what they be up to these young man be support financially by iran most of the time they sneak arm and ammunition into the occupy zone where they set up booby trap for israeli patrol every time an israeli soldier be kill or injure by these trap israel retalliate by indiscriminately bomb village of their own choose often kill only innocent civilian once they be back they announce that they bomb a terrorist hideout where an year old girl just happen to be we be now accustom to israeli tactic and we figure that thi be the israeli way of tell u that if you gon na hurt my soldier you gon na pay the price we accept thi a a price we have to pay to free my land israel know very well that it be not really hurt the resistance that much militarily with these strike but rather just keep the pressure on the villager to demand from their young man to stop attack israeli soldier since these attack be take a heavy toll on the life of the civilian villager israel retalliation policy be cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand be not go to stop it attack on occupying israeli soldier until they withdraw thi be the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw the person of south lebanon be occupy or shell by israel on a regular basi we do not want to be occupy if israel insist that the so call security zone be necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of it occupation with the blood of it soldier if israel be interest in peace than it should withdraw from my land we be not ask for the establishment of a lebanese occupy zone in northern israel to protect my village that be attack on a regular basi by israel so the best policy seem to be the removal of israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keep troop along the border i have write before on thi very newsgroup that the only real solution will come a a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraw to it own border and peace keep troop be station along the border to insure no one on either side of the border be shell thi be the only realistic solution it be time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aim at protect it northern city ha fail in fact it ha cause much more israeli death than the occasional shell of northern israel would have result in if israel really want to save some israeli life it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called security zone before the conclusion of the peace talk such a move would save israeli life advance peace effort give israel a great moral lift better israel public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociation since israel can rightly claim that it be genuinely interest in peace and ha already offer some important concession along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarm by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attack against it northern city and that if such a shell occur than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it there seem to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstance and now the lebanese government ha prove that it be capable of control and disarm all militia a they do in all other part of lebanon if you ask me those question i will have no problem answer not with a question a you do no nobody be qualify candidate for murder nothing justify murder i agree only in the case of the isareli soldier their kill can not be qualify a murder no matter what you say i have the feel that you may be able yourself to make similar statement maybe after eliminate all israeli jew am i wrong ye we have no quarrel with jew or israeli civilian the real problem be with occupying israeli soldier and those brave israeli pilot that bomb my civilian village every time an occupy soldier be attack dorin basil
