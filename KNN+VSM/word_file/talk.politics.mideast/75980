from adam adam shostack subject re wa go hezbollah in article write most of brad post delete we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand be not go to stop it attack on occupying israeli soldier until they withdraw thi be the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw tell me do these young man also attack syrian troop with the blood of it soldier if israel be interest in peace than it should withdraw from my land there must be a guarantee of peace before thi happen it seem that many of these lebanese youth be unable to restrain themself from violence and unable to to realize that their action prolong israel stay in south lebanon if the lebanese army wa able to maintain the peace then israel would not have to be there until it be israel prefer that it soldier die rather than it child if israel really want to save some israeli life it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called security zone before the conclusion of the peace talk such a move would save israeli life advance peace effort give israel a great moral lift better israel public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociation since israel can rightly claim that it be genuinely interest in peace and ha already offer some important concession israel should withdraw from lebanon when a peace treaty be sign not a day before withdraw because of casualty would tell the lebanese person that all they need to do to push israel around be kill a few soldier it not gon na happen along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarm by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attack against it northern city and that if such a shell occur than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it why should israel not demand thi while hold the buffer zone it seem to me that the better bargain position be while hold ymy neighbor land if lebanon be will to agree to those condition israel would quite probably have leave already unfortunately it do seem that the lebanese can disarm the hizbolah and maintain the peace adam adam shostack adam if we have a budget big enough for drug and sexual favor we sure would waste them on member of congres john perry barlow
