from aap alberto adolfo pinka subject re israel an apartheid state in article perlman eric s perlman write fine now if ymy opinion be convince anyone and it get refute regularly by the fact which be the case be it likely that ymy opinion need some revision a i say i do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinion convince anyone i do not believe that my opinion be refute by fact then you have be pay attention to the argument level against them they have be over and over again they will be again so far you have present ymy opinion a oppose to mine i would hardly take them a fact maybe youy view of a dictionary be the problem here one thing be the accept mean of a word by a dictionary and sometime a completely different thing be what that word come to mean after a long time hey what do you think dictionary be for you quite obviously need one a good dictionary gife both and you well know it i could give you hundred of word in my mother tongue spanish that be comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary even more i could show you a lot of mean that word in spanish have different from those in the dictionary ok tell me how many person in zionist movement define a jew in a different way and how many be who define jew base on a religiou way i do think that datum exist on thi directly and gues why is it curiou that we do not know how many person define in how many different way the term jew which be the basi of the movement itself so the evidence show that up to now jew when consider in term of israel the law of return and jewish nationality be define in term of religion and not of cultural identity even if of those define a jew in isreal be not religiou in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do not support the bomb and kill of the ira i believe that jew have a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism a it be right now comparing the action of israel to that of the ira be like compare those of the u to those of chile under pinochet for example with the ira in the role of pinochet you really need to get ymy history straight you also need a basic dictionary you need to start read before answer my point wa that because some movement claim to be nationalistic it do not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic i do not comapre israel to the ira i think that you be start to put word on my mouth and that be wrong that be no problem but once again you be define zionism a one movement you be imply that it be monolithic you know thi be not and ha never be the case that is a problem i be say that i do not support zionism a it be now i believe that among the person in the soviet communist party some might even have be inspire by noble ideal do that change the final result of what happen in the ussr in the same way even if the zionist movement be not homogeneou it do not matter what matter be the result i never say that zionism be monolithic if you be go to attribute me thing present the quote where i say that you do say it directly you imply it and i show explicitly where and how you imply it now you try to wriggle out of it wo wash and you know it i never say it directly nor indirectly i be not talk about individual who define themself a zionist here i be sure most of them be good honest and care person i be talk about the result of the zionist movement i be talk about a movement whose action result in a law of return with a religiou definition of jew a country that define nationality base on religion i be talk about something i consider a form of racism such a differenciation base on religiou belief after all if arab in israel can not serve in the army be becasue they be not bear in the right religion what you say be that judaism be define accord to religiou standard now thi can have several different mean and you know it one of the mean that it can have be to say that only those who be religiou be define a jew another be to say that only those who meet the religiou definition of a jew be one and there be other i not twist ymy word i try to make you aware that ymy word do mean what you think they do i have never hear the definition only those who be religiou be define a jew i have alway see the definition a person be a jew be mother a jew and if such person do not convert although i have see person argue about the last part i be not talk about the debate i be talk about how thing be right now when the debate be over i see what happen right now thing be like they be let me ask you one thing i understand that israel differenciate between citizenship and nationality suppose m ale and f emale have a child in israel which nationality will the child id show accord to each one of the follow case actually it do and the citizen right be exactly the same in both case anyway so there be no difference between citizenship and nationality in israel or what do you mean by actually it do a f and m be both jewish jewish b f be jewsh and m be not jewish c f be muslim and m be jewish d f be christian and m be jewish it depend on what religion be practice in the house the original law of return would still admit such a person if they be jewish if memory serve so it follow a religiou definition and not a cultural one that be what i call a form of racism i do not know why you be so touchy i never say that you do not support palestinian self-determination i just give an example of hypocrisy no you do you have to twist the definition of the word degree in order to do so and everyone else know it i not be touchy you do not need to assume the representation of everybody else to make ymy point you should assume that you be just talk for yourself about the other stuff i still believe that the example wa a valid one it would be a hypocrisy to say that one support nationalism for all and then support zionism and then disregard the palestinian right i never say that someone in thi net be guilty of it it wa just an example nothing more nothing le than that why do you have to clarify what you think because what you give wa not an example it wa an example of how the definition of a word can be twist around degree it wa an example you be try to justify something nobody ha talk about first you should know that word have more mean than those give in the dictionary oh so now what be dictionary for reference it not nonsense when person read what you write they have to try to associate a mean to those word dictionary give the mean of word do they ye but not all of them a language be something that evolf all the time it seem that you can not answer to the idea give by other without insult other sad not at all what i can not abide be utter bombast when you be prove completely wrong not really i post in another post the definition of zionism and in thi post you have show for me what i wa tell you from the begin zionism be a form of racism even if most zionist be not racist in their individual and private life a movement that ask for a state and national right for a person and then in practice that person be define accord to religion be for me racist-like i never put even one syllable in ymy mouth you have try to prove thi and you fail you do it next time be more careful ha there nothing resemble fact in what you say i never add anything to what you say do you know the difference between opinion and fact eric s perlman
