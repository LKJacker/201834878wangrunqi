from tclock tim clock subject re wa go hezbollah in article write it be not a terrorist camp a you and the israeli like to view the village they be small community with kid play soccer in the street woman prepare lunch man play card etc some young man usually age between to year be member of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitant of the village do not know who these be they be secretive about it but most person often suspect who they be and what they be up to these young man be support financially by iran most of the time they sneak arm and ammunition into the occupy zone where they set up booby trap for israeli patrol every time an israeli soldier be kill or injure by these trap israel retalliate by indiscriminately bomb village of their own choose often kill only innocent civilian thi a try and true method utilize by guerilla and terrorist group to conduct operation in the midst of the local populace thu force the oppose state to possible harm innocent civilian in their search or in order to avoid the death of civilian abandon the search certainly the person who use the population for cover be also to blaim for drag the innocent civilian into harm way are you suggest that when guerilla use the population for cover israel should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attack another be to use an innocent a a shield and hope that the other respect innocent life if israel insist that the so call security zone be necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of it occupation with the blood of it soldier ymy damn right israel insist on some sort of demilitarize or buffer zone it have to put up with too many year of attack from the territory of arab state and watch a the state do nothing it be not exactly surprizing that israel decide that the only way to stop such action be to do it themself if israel be interest in peace than it should withdraw from my land what so the whole bite about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for thi to happen it will only occur when arab state show that they be prepare to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratee there be no way israel be go to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance toward anti-israel guerilla in-residence i have write before on thi very newsgroup that the only real solution will come a a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraw to it own border and peace keep troop be station along the border to insure no one on either side of the border be shell good lord brad what in the world gove you the idea that un troop stop anything they be only station in a country because that country allow them in it can ask them to leave at any time a nasser do in and somehow with that limitation on the troop power i do think that israel be go to be any more comfortable without a genuine commitment to peace from the arab state and concrete not intellectual or political exercise in jargon guarantee by other party the un be worthles to israel but perhap useful a a ruse thi be the only realistic solution it be time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aim at protect it northern city ha fail in fact it ha cause much more israeli death than the occasional shell of northern israel would have result in perhap you be aware that to most community of person there be the feel that it be better that many of u die fight against those who attack u than for few to die while we silently accept my fate if however you call on israel to see the sense of suffer fewer casualty i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic group if israel really want to save some israeli life it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called security zone before the conclusion of the peace talk such a move would save israeli life advance peace effort give israel a great moral lift better israel public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociation since israel can rightly claim that it be genuinely interest in peace and ha already offer some important concession along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarm by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attack against it northern city and that if such a shell occur than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it from israel perspective concession get it nothing except the realization that it ha give something up and now can only hope that the other side decide to do likewise word can be take back by merely do so to take back tangible item land control of land require the sort of action you say israel should stay away from israel put up with attack from arab state territory for decade before essentially put a stop to it through it invasion of lebanon the entire basi of that reality wa exactly a you state above israel would expres outrage at these attack and protest to the arab state involve that state promptly ignore the entire matter secure in the knowledge that it could not be hold responsible for the act commit by private group israel would prepare for the next round of attack what would israel want to return to those day and do be so idiotic a to suggest trust for the motivation of present-day arab state there seem to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstance ah ok what be different about the present situation that tell u that the arab state will not pursue their past antagonistic policy toward israel now do talk about vague political factor but about those tangible just like that which israel give up factor that guarantee the responsibility of those state ymy assessment of difference here be base on a whole lot of assumption and most state do feel confortable base their existence on that sort of thing and now the lebanese government ha prove that it be capable of control and disarm all militia a they do in all other part of lebanon basil it ha not without the support and active involvement of syrium lebanon would not have be able to accomplish all that ha occur once syrium leaf who be to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syrium stay thay may be even more dangerou for israel tim ymy view of thi entire matter be far too serenely one-sided and selectively naive
