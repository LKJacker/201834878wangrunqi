international london it be not difficult to discover israel policy toward the palestinian at any give time it can be easily infer from the fact on the grind and from the information provide by the hebrew pres there be one condition though the torrent of claptrap about the peace proces must be totally ignore a must israel official pronouncement whole sole purpose be to distort reality by concentrate only on the fact it wa early apparent that labmy policy be no different from those of shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation likud policy be accurately describe by ariel sharon in an article accompany by a map in yediot aharonot last august the sharon plan envisage a division of the west bank into seven and the gaza strip into fmy autonomou palestinian enclave all of them under israeli supervision the total area of these enclave amount to about per cent of the territory the rest wa to be control by the israeli settlement and the highway build around the enclave the entire area around jerusalem from the outskirt of ramallah to the boundary of bethlehem ha already be turn into a greater jerusalem where the arab inhabit locality amount to small enclave surround by area occupy by israeli settlement or reserve for them judging from labmy settlement policy it may be assume that it may content itself with a lesser number of arab enclave of a rather larger size than sharon have plan but the principle of surround the enclave by settlement strategically disperse along the highway remain unchanged labmy plan only fmy enclave in the west bank two in samarium and two in judea north and south of jerusalem respectively and no more than two in the gaza strip in regard to greater jerusalem labmy policy hardly deviate from sharon a saner version of likud policy a some israeli correspondent at once realise labmy policy be but a saner version of sharon extravaganza last july gideon eshet write in yediot aharonot that while barely a few month ago labmy support the demand to freeze all construction beyond the green line no specific decision to freeze construction in the territory ha be take and uzi benziman write in that a far a can be judge on the basi of the internal political discussion in jerusalem rabin intend to stick to likud way the two biggest enclave envisage by labmy be locate in samarium therefore the belt of settlement around the trans-samarium highway design to separate those enclave from each other be of paramount importance according to the latest datum the percentage of israeli settler in the entire west bank population apart from east jerusalem be a mere per cent but for the area around the trans-samarium highway the correspond figure be almost per cent and it be increase steadily the situation in the settlement of the efrat block south of jerusalem design to sever the enclave around bethlehem from the one around hebron be pretty much the same the efrat block be now be connect with west jerusalem by a highway the project be costly in the extreme because the highway be design to bypas bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnel the final decision to build thi highway wa suspend until rabin return from hi u visit in march the subsequent decision to renew it construction can be see a u approval for the enclave plan a a whole proces of impoverishment the enclave plan imply deliberate and steady impoverishment of the palestinian thi be well know in israel but ignore abroad by all who should be concern include the plo in regard to the gaza strip the whole proces wa best describe by shiff in in march he mention have see a pamphlet issue six year ago by the civil administration forecast the condition in the gaza strip under israeli rule in hi analysi deserve to be quote extensively we continue to steal the strip water even though it quality deteriorate from year to year we continue to steal the strip tiny land resource in order to find there more and more settlement a if we deliberately want to make the inhabitant despair and in their despair think in termw of have nothing to lose it be by my own do that the strip worker must now spend travel to their workplace almost a much time a they spend work from the military point of view we have keep control of no more than half the strip area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resource about a year before moshe aren leave the defence ministry i hear him say that we should withdraw from the strip come what may hi argument wa that israel sink into the strip ever deeper and deeper he tell me he have propose thi to yitzhak shamir but he reject it yitzhak rabin reject it too enormou state support for the qatif block settler can also be cite a proof that the enclave plan be be implement the qatif block settlement found by the first rabin government of be intend to divide the gaza strip into two separate enclave efraim davidi of davar have datum show how vital for israeli thi enterprise be the qatif block be now produce per cent of israeli tomato destine for export and a substantial proportion of cut flower he also deal with the subsidy the settler receive considerably augment by the present government owing to them house unit be cheap the present government do not spare effort to recruit new settler to the block any prospective settler will get a per cent mortgage for hi house on top of a grant of shekel such datum show that israel plan apply whether the palestinian of the gaza strip be allow or forbid to work in israel the economic motivation be explain by danny rubinstein in in march from the economic viewpoint gaza could already be seal off hermetically and all the strip worker could be bar from enter israel even though accurate datum be hard to come by it be indisputable that during the last two year the numbe of gazan worker arrive daily to work in israel ha markedly decrease from in the to today but the decrease be not only due to restriction impose on enter israel from gaza it be also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for gazan labmy in israel with unemployment in israel soar and the construction of apartment block virtually halt the worker from gaza be no longer really need gaza total dependence the entire economy of the gaza strip be totally dependent on israel in recent year in the gaza strip there ha be an increase in sub-contracted work for israeli factory mostly footware and textile thousand of small workshop employ an average of fmy worker get their raw material or unfinished product together with detail work instruction from israeli factory rubinstein attribute thi development to the fact that the average wage in the gaza strip be merely per cent of that in the west bank which in turn stand at half the average wage in israel and beside the gazan employer do not pay any social security for hi employee if the average wage in the gaza strip be just a fifth of that in israel the profit of israeli factory and even of palestinian sub-contractor must be vast they be higher still when a gazan sub-contractor provide labmy to be perform at home with the family help the livelihood of ten of thousand of gazan depend on such sub-contracted work many of them be woman and child pay about ten shekel a day which can last hour or more there can be no doubt that profit from exploit cheap gazan labmy be one of the reason for the stubborn opposition of rabin and other israeli minister to withdrawal from the strip economic condition in the gaza strip differ little from what wa create straight after israel conquest in in thi respect one should not be delude by the talk nowaday fashionable about israeli gesture intend to encourage economic development in the territory a israeli journalist point out all permit for open new business depend on a prior approval by the shin bet behind all the profess goodwill there be no desire to solve problem just the attitude of a good colonialist will to do something for the benefit of the native but on condition that they behave nicely do not become rebelliou and never do anything against the interest of the metropoli it economic interest include write michal sela in davar in february the development of sub-contracted work in the gaza strip accord perfectly with sela diagnosi sela also show how exactly the economic control work in all branch of the economy lobby have be set in motion for purpose of free israeli production from the threat of any palestinian competition the method be simplicity itself a soon a any israeli producer succeed in persuade the government or even the trade and industry minister alone a military order be issue prohibit the export of a give produce to israel if thi do not suffice a palestinian factory may be deny a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacle may paralyse it production among the most active of such lobby be the agricultural one it ha succeed in limit export of gazan vegetable except for those grow by settler not only to israel but also to europe where they otherwise might compete with israeli export perpetuaring apartheid labmy goal be to perpetuate thi apartheid regime in the territory the same goal be share by the u which otherwise could not support the labmy government so firmly in my view one of the reason the u feel happier about support labmy than likud be it greater efficiency in pursue the settlement drive thi point wa bring home by ofer shelah in who deplore the settler failure which he attribute to likud inefficiency he show that the peak yearly settlement growth occur during the term of office of the national unity government in which rabin serve throughout a the defence minister likud reputation for settle the territory better than labmy be false attributable to the many tiny settlement without strategic value found under shamir for symbolic reason to sum up labmy policy unconditionally support by the u differ from that of likud primarily in the efficiency with which it be implement according to that policy the territory be to be divide into two part the major part be to be rule by israel directly and the minor part indirectly in my view thi racist scheme be doom to ultimately fail but at a horrify price in human suffer the sooner it true nature be recognise the le suffer it may cause
