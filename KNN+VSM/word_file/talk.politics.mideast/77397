from perlman eric s perlman subject re israel an apartheid state in article aap alberto adolfo pinka write in article perlman eric s perlman write so far you have present ymy opinion a oppose to mine i would hardly take them a fact because you do agree with them hmm no because a fact and an opinion be two different thing what you be express here be opinion not fact in the abstract what you say be true but the fact happen to agree with me and disagree completely with you i could give you hundred of word in my mother tongue spanish that be comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary even more i could show you a lot of mean that word in spanish have different from those in the dictionary we talk about the latter not the former and what you talk about be slang in the latter that clearly ha never be the case here no i be not talk about slang i be talk about different use of the same language in different place listen pinka i go to count on the supposition that you think through the opinion you have something which be by the way against my better judgment base on what i see from you to date we be agree be we that dictionary be reference book for the usage of a give language and in particular for the mean of the word and phrase which comprise that language now you be use mean completely different from indeed in some case diametrically different from those give in the dictionary a a reference book a dictionary contain those mean in both past and a much a it can in current use that also why they be update so often now if you be say thing which you give different mean than the dictionary do and use non-standard mean about every word what be ymy chance of be take at face value just about none just about no one will take you that way because the word mean something different to them it quite clear to me from the response thi thread ha be get that that be exactly what be happen ponder that and gues why is it curiou that we do not know how many person define in how many different way the term jew which be the basi of the movement itself no probably because the question ha be ask gee i hate it when person draw conclusion without information do you i hate person who can not read i do not draw any conclusion i just say that it be curiou consider how heterogeneou the movement be what you do wa ask a lead question in english idiom the phrase and gues why in the way you use it be a load question with only one answer expect i also take offense at be tell i can not read by someone who be obviously have trouble with the subject himself mr pinka i be a phd candidate in my field one do not get to phd candidacy if one can not read the law of return and jewish nationality be define in term of religion and not of cultural identity even if of those define a jew in isreal be not religiou for the umpteenth time it be not define in term of religion thi ha be prove to you over and over again no it ha not the law of return define a jew a someone who ha a jewish mother and ha not convert to another religion that be pretty the same a the religiou definition that is a problem i be say that i do not support zionism a it be now i believe that among the person in the soviet communist party some might even have be inspire by noble ideal do that change the final result of what happen in the ussr are you now wish to compare the ussr and israel or what israel do not practice cruelty now i understand you be unable to make abstraction you can not get the idea from a text and you take everything literally bad thing balderdash you know thi be false i would be able to make the abstraction if it bore any resemblance to the fact of the matter your do not the analogy be utterly inapplicable i would be in the field i in astrophysic if i could make abstraction and speculate about the general grand scheme of thing i also would be in education which i be and my student give me rather good review i add if i could draw such analogy about israel not practice cruelty ask those palestinian in israeli prison those who be torture those whose house have be blow by the army the vast majority of palestinian in israeli prison be torture and their house be blow up by the army in fact you see me protest such measure on thi net before are you now try to intimate my agreement with them i never say it directly nor indirectly i be not talk about individual who define themself a zionist here i be sure most of them be good honest and care person i be talk about the result of the zionist movement in other word you be take that a a monolith and ignore the dissension within it disagreement that be express freely and be widely base just a bad can you read or be you just type at random do you know the mean of the word you use or do you expect the reader to read ymy mind i can read just fine thank you and i do need someone who be obviously have some trouble with a tongue which be hi native one tell me how to read the word in my own native tongue if it be spanish i ask you i be talk about a movement whose action result in a law of return with a religiou definition of jew a country that define nationality base on religion then you not talk about the movement a it exist today a i be try to tell you please read the argument i give you if you can still say thi after read them you need to read them again i be talk about something i consider a form of racism such a differenciation base on religiou belief after all if arab in israel can not serve in the army be becasue they be not bear in the right religion arab in israel not only can but do serve in the idf a you well know they can serve it be true but they be not allow to do the all the same thing a the israeli citizen who happen to be jew ye they be a you well know ok fine now we know what you talk about but do you see my point about how ymy word could easily have be take differently it be not we it wa you a in the second person in singular who can not understand a text if thing be not explicitly say balderdash see above once again you have a lot of gall and absolutely no right to lecture a native speaker of a language who be well educate in it in a language which be ymy own native tongue and with which you obviously have problem so there be no difference between citizenship and nationality in israel or what do you mean by actually it do i mean exactly that arab and jewish citizen of israel have the same right if there be no difference between them why keep them in id better yet be you go to tell me that there be no difference in social life between arab and jew social life be one thing legal statu be another once again thi be a lead question so it follow a religiou definition and not a cultural one that be what i call a form of racism no because the jewish religion and culture be intimately inseparably intertwine if one renounce judaism one renounce judaism i do not believe that thi be true final question is it possible to be both jewish and muslim jewish and christian ymy response will be enlighten how sad to model of decorum and like any other sport a battleground for rival ideology to slug it out with glee tim rice ches eric s perlman
