from hernlem brad hernlem subject re wa go hezbollah in article tclock tim clock write in article write it be not a terrorist camp a you and the israeli like to view the village they be small community with kid play soccer in the street woman prepare lunch man play card etc some young man usually age between to year be member of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitant of the village do not know who these be they be secretive about it but most person often suspect who they be and what they be up to these young man be support financially by iran most of the time they sneak arm and ammunition into the occupy zone where they set up booby trap for israeli patrol every time an israeli soldier be kill or injure by these trap israel retalliate by indiscriminately bomb village of their own choose often kill only innocent civilian thi a try and true method utilize by guerilla and terrorist group to conduct operation in the midst of the local populace thu force the oppose state to possible harm innocent civilian in their search or in order to avoid the death of civilian abandon the search certainly the person who use the population for cover be also to blaim for drag the innocent civilian into harm way are you suggest that when guerilla use the population for cover israel should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attack another be to use an innocent a a shield and hope that the other respect innocent life tell me tim what be these guerilla do wrong assuming that they be use civilian for cover be they not kill soldier in their country if the buffer zone be to prevent attack on israel be it not work why be it further neccessary for israeli gun to pound lebanese village why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there be more to the shell of the village it be call retaliation getting back getting even it do make sense to shell the village the least it show be a reckles disregard by the israeli government for the life of civilian if israel insist that the so call security zone be necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of it occupation with the blood of it soldier if israel be interest in peace than it should withdraw from my land what so the whole bite about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for thi to happen it will only occur when arab state show that they be prepare to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratee there be no way israel be go to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance toward anti-israel guerilla in-residence if israel be not will to accept the word of other then imho it ha no busines waste other time come to the peace talk i have write before on thi very newsgroup that the only real solution will come a a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraw to it own border and peace keep troop be station along the border to insure no one on either side of the border be shell good lord brad no i be not basil i think basil be a very intelligent person and i respect what he write basil be a person that i would gladly call a friend he be however not me nor be i lebanese a some seem to suspect thi be the only realistic solution it be time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aim at protect it northern city ha fail in fact it ha cause much more israeli death than the occasional shell of northern israel would have result in perhap you be aware that to most community of person there be the feel that it be better that many of u die fight against those who attack u than for few to die while we silently accept my fate if however you call on israel to see the sense of suffer fewer casualty i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic group tim you be ignore the fact that the palestinian in lebanon have be disarm hezbollah remain the only independent militium hezbollah do not attack israel except at a few time such a when the idf burn up sheikh mosavus hi wife and young son of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinate person and shell village they would make the lebanese so mad a to do that furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarm it would not be possible and now the lebanese government ha prove that it be capable of control and disarm all militia a they do in all other part of lebanon basil it ha not without the support and active involvement of syrium lebanon would not have be able to accomplish all that ha occur once syrium leaf who be to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syrium stay thay may be even more dangerou for israel tim when be the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border not lately eh israel know very well that the syrian be able to restrain all who would use territory under their control to attack israel while lebanon would be better off with syrium and israel out of it border the presence of syrian troop in lebanon ha mean a sharp decrease in attack on israeli territory not on israeli troop in lebanon however please note the distinction in the past two year tim ymy view of thi entire matter be far too serenely one-sided and selectively naive i disagree basil ha alway seem to me to be a cool-headed person slow to anger certainly more so than i what be most important be that he be an actual witnes to thing from the other end of the israeli gun if only the israeli government would remember what it wa like when the role be reverse perhap they would moderate their retaliation brad hernlem hernlem
