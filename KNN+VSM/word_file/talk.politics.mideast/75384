from flax jona flygare subject re israeli murder in march in article hasan write after a small refresh hasan get on the track again in article flax jona flygare write in article hasan write in article flax jona flygare write i get the impression hasan realize he goof and be now try to drop the thread let him it might save some miniscule portion of hi sorry face not really since i be a logical person who like further himself from any name call i start trash any article that contain such bus without respond to and sometime not even read article write by those who acquire such bad habit from bad company ah but in my followup on the subject which you by the way never bother respond to there wa no name-calling hence the assumption do you feel more up to it now so that we might have an answer or to refresh ymy memory do the human right issue in the area apply to palestinian only also do you claim there be such a thing a forfeit a human right if that possible then explain to the rest of u how there can exist any such thing use ymy logic and convince u thi be ymy golden chance jona flygare well ok let see what master of wisdom mr jona flygare write that can be wisdomely respond to are you call name or give me a title if the first read ymy paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again master of wisdom write in hasan flax hasan in case you didnot know palestinean be there for month and they be come back when you agree to give palestinean their human-right afterall human right arenot negotiable correct me if i wrong but be the right to one life also a right or do it only apply to palestinian no it be everybody right however when a killer kill then he be give up willingly or unwillingly hi life right to the society the society represent by the goverment would exercise it duty by deprive the killer off hi life right so then it all right for israel to kill the person who kill israeli the old for an eye think funny i think modern legal system be make to counter exactly that so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom if you insist on give me i do not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh when you be intentionally neglect the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupy territory be illegitimate and hence all their action their court their law be illegitimate on the grind of occupy territory no i be not neglect that i merely ask you whether the existance of israeli citicen in the wb or in gaza invalidate those individual right to live a a you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be use in the territory later also you have not adressed my question if the israeli also have human right what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i do explain my point in the post that you respond to the point be that since israel be occupy then it be automatically deprive itself from some of it right to the occupied palestinean which be exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from hi right of life to the society if a state can deprive all it citizen of human right by it action then tell me why any human live today should have any right at all in conjugtion with the above when a group of person occupy other territory and rule them by force then thi group would be willingly or unwillingly deprive from some of it right such a the right to live that nice the swedish government be a group of person that rule me by force do that give me the right to kill them do you consider yourself that you have pose a worthy question here worthy or not i wa just apply ymy logic to a relate problem am i to assume you admit it would hold what kind of right and how much would be deprive be another issue the answer be to be find in a certain system such a international law u law israeli law and now it very convenient to start use the legal system to prove a point excuse me while i throw up ok master of wisdom be throw up you person stay away from the screen while he be do it oh do you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone i let you in on a secret it not for real take my word for it it seem that the u law represent by u state dept in thi case be look to the other way around when violence occur in occupy territory anyway a for hama then obviously they turn to the islamic system and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question be not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the law of minister sharon say kick palestinean out of here all palestine i ask for which system should be use that will preserve human right for all person involve i assume that wa obviou but i wo repeat that mistake now that i have straighten that out i eagerly await ymy reply joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization say it best when write in hi diary in between ourself it must be clear that there be no room for both people together in thi country we shall not achieve my goal of be an independent person with the arab in thi small country the only solution be a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arab and there be no other way than to transfer the arab from here to the neighbour country to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be leave only after thi transfer will the country be able to absorb the million of my own brother there be no other way out davar september courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we be to disregard the rather obviou reference to get israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hama charter that the english translation if you have other information i be interest to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i not go to get into the question if he write the above but it fairly obviou all party in the conflict have their share of fanatic gues what those be not the person that will make any last peace in the region ever it those who be will to make a tabula rasa and start over and will to give in order to get something back we and my either refer to zionist or jew i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solve the me problem i think that be fair enough no that be not an answer since i ask for a system that could solve the problem you say any could be use then you provide a contradiction gues where that take ymy logic to never-never land the greatest problem of zionism be arab child rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quote you put at the end be a real bummer when i try give ymy post any credit
