organization at school no member of the sumgait city komsomol committee office resident at building apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan note the event in kafan use a a pretext to attack armenian in azerbaijan be false a verify by independent international human right organization dd i think about the price the sumgait armenian pay to be live in armenium now we pay for it in human casualty and cripple fate the price wa too great now after the sumgait tragedy we the victim divide my life into before and after we talk like that that wa before the war like the person who go through world war ius and consider it a whole epoch a fate no matter how many year go by no matter how long we live it will never be forget on the contrary some of the moment become even sharper in my rage in my sorrow we saw everything differently but now they say that you can see more with distance and we can see those inhuman event with more clarity now we more acutely perceive my loss and everything that happen nineteen eighty-eight wa a leap year everyone fear a leap year and want it to pa a quickly a possible yet we never think that that leap year would be such a black one for every sumgait armenian those who lose someone and those who do that second to last day of winter wa ordinary for my family although you could already smell danger in the air but we do think that the danger wa near and possible so we do take any step to save ourself at least a my parent say at least we should have do something to save the child my parent themself be not that old and year but then they think that they have already live enough and do everything they could to save u in my apartment the tragedy start on february around five in the afternoon i call it a tragedy and i repeat it wa a tragedy even though all my family survive when i recall how they break down my door my skin crawl even now among armenian among person who wish me only well i feel like it all start over again i remember how that mob break into my apartment my parent be stand in the hall my father have an axe in hi hand and have immediately lock both of the door my door wa rarely lock since friend and neighbor often drop by we know a a hospitable family and we just never really think about whether the person who be come to see u be azerbaijani jew or russian we have friend of many nationality even a turkman woman my parent be in the hall my father with an axe i remember him tell my mother run to the kitchen for a knife but mother wa detach pale a though she have decide to sell her life a bite dearer to be honest i never expect it of her she afraid of get shoot and afraid of the dark a girlfriend wa at the house that day a russian girl lyuda and mamma say no matter what happen no matter what they do to u you not to come out of the bedroom we go to tell them that we alone in the apartment we go into the bedroom there be fmy of u marina and the russian girl crawl under the bed and we cover them up with a rug box of dish and karina and i be stand there and look at one another the idea that perhap we be see each other for the last time flash somewhere inside me i an emotional person and i expres my emotion immediately i want to embrace her and ki her a though it be the last second and maybe karina wa think the same thing but she quite reserve we do have time to say anything to each other because we immediately hear mamma raise a shout there wa so much noise from the tramp of foot from the shout and from excite voice i could figure what wa go on out there because the door to the bedroom wa only open a crack but when mamma shout the second time karina run out of the bedroom i run after her i have want to hold her back but when she open the door and run out into the hall they saw u immediately the only thing i manage to do wa close the door behind me at least so a to save marina and her friend the mob wa shout all of their eye be shin all red like from insomnium at first about person burst in but later i wa stand with my back to the door and could see they come into the hall into the kitchen and drag my father into the other room he do utter a word he just raise the axe to hit them but mamma snatch the axe from behind and say tell them not to touch the child tell them they can do a they want with u but not to harm the child she say thi to father in armenian there be azerbaijani from armenium among the mob who break in they understand armenian perfectly the local azerbaijani do know armenian they do need to speak it and one of them respond in armenian you and ymy child both we go to do the same thing to you and ymy child that you armenian do in kafan they kill my woman my girl my mother they cut their breast off and burn my house and so on and so forth and we come to do the same thing to you thi whole time some of them be destroy the house and the other be shout at u they be mostly young person under at first there be any older person among them and all of their face be unfamiliar sumgait be a small town all the same and we know a lot of person by their face especially me i a teacher so they drag my father into the other room they twist hi arm and take him in there no they do take him in there they drag him in there because he wa already unable to walk they close the door to that room all but a crack we could see what wa happen to father what they be do to him then a young man about year old start to tear off mamma sarafan and mamma shout at him in azerbaijani i old enough to be ymy mother what be you do he strike her now he be hold mamma identify him i hope he convict then they go after karina who be talk to them like a komsomol leader a though she be try to lead them down a different path a they say to influence their consciousnes she tell them that what they be do wa wrong that they must do it she say come on let straighten thi out without emotion what do you want who be you why do you come here what do we ever do to you someone try to explain who they be and why they have come into my home but then the one in the back more of them keep come and come say what be you talk to them for you should kill them we come here to kill them they push karina strike her and she fell down they beat her but she do cry out even when they tear her clothe off she keep repeat what do we do to you what do we do to you and even later when she come to she say mamma what do we do to them why do they do that to u that group wa prepare i know thi because i notice that some of them only break up furniture and other only deal with u i remember that when they be beat me when they be tear my clothe off i felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention wa rivet to karina all i could do wa watch how much they beat her and how painful it wa for her and what they do to her that why i felt no pain later when they carry karina off they beat her savagely it really amaze that she not only live but do lose her mind she be very beautiful and they do everything they could to destroy her beauty mostly they beat her face with their fist kick her use anything they could find mamma karina and i be all in one room and again i do feel any pain just do feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they do then one of those creep say that there wa enough room in the apartment they break up the bed and the desk and move everything into the corner so there would be more room then someone suggest let take her outside those beast be in heaven they do what they would do every day if they be afraid of the authority those be their true color at the time i think that in fact they would alway behave that way if they be afraid of what would happen to them when they carry karina out and beat mamma-her face wa completely cover with blood that when i start to feel the pain i black out several time from the pain but each moment that i have my eye open it wa a though i be record it all on film i think i a kind person by nature but i vengeful especially if someone be mean to me and i do deserve it i hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally cause me pain and every time i would come to and see one of those animal on top of me i remember them and i remember them for the rest of my life even though person tell me forget you have to forget you have to go on live at some point i remember that they stand me up and tell me something and despite the fact that i hurt all over i have be beat terribly i find the strength in myself to interfere with their torture i realize that i have to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffer to an end i push one of them away he wa a real horse i remember now that he be hold too a though they be all wait for it they seize me and take me out onto the balcony i have long hair and it wa stick all over me one of the veranda shutter to the balcony wa open and i realize that they plan to throw me out the window because they have already pick me up with their hand i wa up in the air a though for the last time i take a really deep breath and close my eye and somehow brace myself inside i suddenly become cold a though my heart have sink into my foot and suddenly i felt myself fly i could figure out if i wa really fly or if i just imagine it when i come to i think now i go to smash on the grind and when it do happen i open my eye and realize that i wa still lie on the floor and since i do scream do beg them at all they become all the more wild like wolf they start to trample me with their foot shoe with heel on them and iron horseshoe like they have spe cially put them on then i lose consciousnes i come to a couple of time and wait for death summon it beseech it some person ask for good health life happiness but at that moment i do need any of those thing i wa sure that none of u would survive and i have even forget about marina and if none of u wa alive it wa worth live there wa a moment when the pain wa especially great i withstand inhuman pain and realize that they be go to torment me for a long time to come because i have show myself to be so tenaciou i start to strangle myself and when i start to wheeze they realize that with my death i wa go to put an end to their pleasure and they pull my hand from my throat the person who injure and insult me most painfully i remember him very well because he wa the oldest in the group he look around i know that he ha fmy child and that he consider himself an ideal father and person one who would never do such a thing something come over him then you see even during the investigation he almost call me daughter he apologize although of course he know that i never forgive him something like that i can never forgive i have never injure anyone with my behavior with my word or with my deed i have alway put myself in the other person shoe but then in a matter of hour they trample me entirely i shall never forget it i want to do myself in then because i have nothing to lose because no one could protect me my father who try to do something against that hoard of beast by himself could do nothing and would be able to do anything i know that i wa even sure that he wa no longer alive and ira melkumian my acquaintance i know her and have be to see her family a couple of time her brother try to save her and could so he try to kill her hi very own sister he throw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffer when they strip her clothe off and carry her into the other room her brother know what await her i do know which one it wa edik or igor both of them be in the room from which the axe wa throw but the axe hit one of the person carry her and so they kill her and make her death even more excruciate maybe the most excruciate of all the death of those day in sumgait i hear about it all from the neighbor from the melkumian land hi name be makhaddin he know my family a little he come to see how we have get settle in the new apartment in baku how we be feel and if we need anything he a good person he say you should praise god that you all survive but what i saw with my own eye i a man who ha see so many person die who ha live a whole life i he say nearly lose my mind that day i have never see the like of it and think i never shall again the door to hi apartment wa open and he saw everything one of the brother throw the axe because they have already take the father and mother out of the apartment igor edik and ira remain he saw ira naked be carry into the other room in the hand of six or seven person he tell u about it and say he would never forget it he hear the brother shout something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that they be powerles to do anything but all the same they try to do something the guy who get hit with the axe live i i after i have be unsuccessful at kill myself i saw them take marina and lyuda out of the bedroom i wa in such a state that i could even remember my sister name i want to cry marina out to her but could not i look at her and know that it wa a familiar dear face but could for the life of me remember what her name wa and who she wa and thu i save her because when they be take her out she a it turn out have tell them that she have just be visit and that she and lyuda be both there by chance that they be armenian lyuda a russian you can tell right away and marina speak azerbaijani wonderfully and she tell them that she wa an azerbaijani and i almost give her away and doom her i glad that at least marina come out of thi all in good physical health although her spirit wa murder at some point i come to and saw igor igor agayev my acquaintance in that mob he life in the neighbor build for some reason i remember hi name maybe i sense my defense in him i call out to him in russian igor help but he turn away and go into the bedroom just then they be take marina and lyuda out of the bedroom igor say he know marina and lyuda that marina in fact wa azerbaijani and he take both of them to the neighbor and the idea steal through me that maybe igor have lead them to my apartment something like that but if he wa my friend he wa suppose to save me then they be strike me very hard we have an indian vase a metal one they be hit me on the back with it and i black out they take me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window they be already sure that i wa dead because i do react at all to the new blow someone say she already dead let throw her out when they carry me out onto the balcony for the second time when i wa about to die the second time i hear someone say in azerbaijani do kill her i know her she a teacher i can still hear that voice ring in my ear but i ca remember whose voice it wa it wa igor because he speak azerbaijani with an accent hi mother be russian and they speak russian at home he speak azerbaijani worse than my marina do i remember when they carry me in and throw me on the bed he come up to me that person and i have open my eye saw and recognize that person but immediately pass out cold i have be beat so much that i do have the strength to remember him i only remember that thi person wa older and he have a high position unfortunately i ca remember anything more what should i say about igor he do treat me badly i have hear a lot about him that he wa that good a person that he sometime drink too much once he boast to me that he have serve in afghanistan he know that woman usually like bravery in a man especially if a man wa in afghanistan if he wa wound then it about eighty percent sure that he will be treat very sympathetically with respect later i find out that he have serve in ufa and wa injure but that not in afghanistan of course i find that all out later among the person who be in my apartment my karina also saw the secretary of the party organization i do know hi last name hi first name be najaf he be an armenian-born azerbaijani but later karina wa so sure she wa no longer a hundred percent sure that it wa he she saw and she do want to endanger him she say he wa there and a little while later maybe they beat me so much that i be confuse him with someone else no it seem like it wa he i be sure it wa he because when he come to see u the first time he say one thing and the next time he say something entirely different the investigator have summon him yet he come to see u in the khimik board house where we be live at the time he bring grocery and flower thi wa right before march he almost start cry he wa so upset to see my condition i do know if he wa put u on or not but later after we have tell the investigator and they summon him to the procuracy he say that he have be in baku he wa in sumgait the fact that he change hi testimony lead me to believe that karina be right that in fact it wa he who wa in my apartment i do know how the investigator be now treat him at one point i wonder and ask and wa tell that he have an alibi and wa not in my apartment could he have go to baku and arrange an alibi i not rule out that possibility ill now return to my apartment mamma have come to you could say that she buy them off with the gold father give her when they be marry her wed band and her watch be gold she buy her own and her husband life with them she give the gold to a old boy vadim vorobyev a russian boy he speak azerbaijani perfectly he an orphan who wa raise by hi grandfather and who life in sumgait on nizami street he go to a special school one for mentally handicap child but i say thi i a teacher all the same and in a matter of minute i can form an opinion that boy be not at all mentally handicap he healthy he can think just fine and analyze too policeman should be so lucky and he cunning too after that he go home and tear all of the picture out of hi photo album he beat mamma and demand gold say lady if you give u all the gold and money in ymy apartment we let you live and mamma tell them where the gold wa he bring in the bag and open it shake out the content and everyone who wa in the apartment jump on it start knock each other over and take the gold from one another i surprise they do kill one another right then mamma wa still in control of herself she have be beat up her face wa black and blue from the blow and her eye be fill with blood and she run into the other room father wa lie there tie up with a gag in hi mouth and a pillow over hi face there wa a break table on top of the pil low mamma grab father and he could walk like me he wa half dead halfway into the other world he could comprehend anything could see and wa cover with black and blue mamma pull the gag out of hi mouth it wa some sort of cloth i think it wa a slipcover from an armchair the bandit be still in my apartment even in the room mamma pull father out of lead him out of carry him out of we have two armchair in that room a small magazine table a couch a television and a screen three person be stand next to that screen and into their shirt their

him but at the threshold i could hold him up he fell down and i pick him up again and drag him down the stair to the neighbor mamma remember one of the criminal the one who have watch her with hi face half-turned toward her out of one eye she say i realize that my death would come from that person i look him in the eye and he recoil from fear and go steal later they catch that scoundrel meanwhile mamma grab father and leave i wa alone igor have take marina away mamma and father be go karina wa already outside i do know what they be do to her i wa leave all alone and at that moment i become someone else do you understand even though i know that neither mother and father in the other room nor marina and lyuda under the bed could save me all the same i somehow manage to hold out i go on fight them i bite someone i remember and i scratch another but when i wa leave alone i realize what kind of person they be the one i have observe the one who beat karina what kind of person they be the one who beat me that it wa all unnecessary that i wa about to die and that all of that would die with me at some point i take heart when i saw the young man from the next build i do know hi name but we would greet one another when we meet we know that we be from the same microdistrict when i saw him i say neighbor be that you in so do i place myself in great danger he realize that if i live i would remember him that when he grab the axe the axe that have be take from my father i automatically fell to my knee and raise my hand to take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have be better if he have strike me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery when he start get ready to wind back for the blow someone come into the room the newcomer have such an impact on
