from casper casper subject re american jewish congres open letter to clinton in article arromdee ken arromdee write in article casper casper write i complain about the u take the point in bosnium when the european should be do it ken say the bosnian be morally superior to the serbian thi imply both side be equal true it may sometime be difficult or impossible to determine which side be the victim but that do not mean that victim do not exist ye victim exist there be a stagger number of victim in the world and more each day i think on balance intervention would create more victim include american one since the first responsibility of the u government be to protect american i think they serve that role best by stay away from bosnium and other regional conflict would you in wwius have say that there be atrocity on the side of both the jew and the german of course not the jew be not try to carve a territory out of germany either and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprise do not have an army or a government these person have be butcher each other for century when one side win and get what it want it will stop ye but both side want different thing the muslim chiefly want to not be ethnic cleanse the serbian want to ethnic cleanse the muslim it be indeed true that each side will stop when it get what it want but the thing that the two side want be not equivalent i see the pattern of atrocity a a fairly often practice tactic of a colonize power drive away eliminate the population of an area they want to control the u try basically that in vietnam the iraqi in kuwait the israeli in palestine south africa etc etc etc it suck it ugly and it sadden but it be not genocide it be not my impression that the serb want to eliminate every muslim in yugoslavium i still say the bosnian be get their as kick they should surrender and evacuate the area they ca hold i say the fixation on bosnium be due to it be in a european country rather than the third world i recall before we do anything for somalium apparent left-winger say that the reason everyone wa more will to send troop to bosnium than to somalium wa because the somali be third-worlder who american consider unworthy of help they suddenly shut up when the u decide to send troop to the opposite place than that predict by the theory i be a staunch republican btw the irony of argue against military intervention with argument base on vietnam ha not escape me i wa oppose to u intervention in somalium for the same reason although clearly it wa not nearly a risky for that matter thi theory of your suggest that american should want to help the serb after all they christian and the muslim be not if the desire to intervene in bosnium be base on racism against person that be le like u why do everyone want to help the side that be le like u especially if both of the side be equal a you seem to think well one thing you have to remember be the pres like a good story good for busines do you know and btw not everyone want to help the side that be le like u i never say the two side be morally equivalent i say neither one be innocent there be just too many good reason to stay away the european be perfectly able to deal with thi dispute on their border in any way we do it put another way we have no assistance to offer the european which they do not already posse themself it be not good to promote the idea in anyone mind that the united state be responsible for clean up every bloody me in the world clinton be not the man to lead thi country into a military adventure full stop it be by no mean clear what intervention would accomplish nor that it would necessarily help the victim it be not clear what the goal be and at what point any commitment could be end
