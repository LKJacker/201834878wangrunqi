stay there until eleven at night we hear the sound of motor the neighbor say that it wa armor personnel carrier we go downstair there wa a light on in the room where we leave father in the other room a we find out later all the chandelier have be tear down they leave only one bulb the bulb wa burn which probably wa a signal they have agree on because there wa a light burn in every apartment in my microdistrict where there have be a pogrom with the help of the soldier we make it to the city party committee and be save my salvation my mother my brother and mine wa purely accidental because a we later find out from the neighbor someone in the crowd shout that we have firearm up there well we fight but we be only able to save mother we could save father we inflict many injury on the bandit some of them seriou but other come to take their place we be also wound there wa blood and we be scratch all over we get my share it wa a miracle we survive we be save by a miracle and the troop and if troop have come to sumgait the slaughter would have be even greater probably all the armenian would have be victim of the genocide through an acquaintance at the city party committee i wa able to contact the leadership of the military unit that wa bring into the city and at their order we be assign special person to accompany u expert we go to pick up father corpse we take it to the morgue thi wa about two in the morning it wa already march it wa rain very hard and it wa quite cold and we be wear only my suit when my brother and i carry father into the morgue we saw the burn and disfigure corpse there be about six burn person in there and the small corpse of a burn child it wa gruesome i suffer a tremendou shock there be about ten person there but the doctor on duty say that because of the number they be be take to baku there wa a woman corpse there too she have be well there wa part of a body there a hacked-off part of a woman body it wa something terrible the morgue wa guard by the land force the child that have be kill wa only ten or twelve year old it wa impossible to tell if it wa a boy or a girl because the corpse wa burn there wa a man there too several man you could tell anything because their face be disfigure they be in such awful condition now two and a half month have pass every day i recall with horror what happen in the city of sumgait every day my father and the death of my father and how we fight and the person sorrow and especially the morgue i still want to say that year have pass since soviet power wa establish and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happen in sumgait it will go down in history i particularly surprise that the mob wa even afraid of the troop they even fight the soldier many soldier be wound the mob throw fuel mixture onto the armor personnel carrier set them on fire they be afraid they be so sure of their impunity that they attack my troop i saw the clash on february near the airline ticket office right acros from my build and that mob wa fight with the soldier the inhabitant of some of the build also azerbaijani throw rock at the soldier from window balcony even cinder block and glas tank they be afraid of them i say they be sure of their impunity when we be at the neighbor and when they be rob home near the airline ticket office i call the polouse at number and say that they be rob armenian apartment and burn home and they tell me that they know that they be be burn during those day no one from the polouse department come to anyone aid no one come to help u either to my home even though perhap they could have come and save u a we later find out the mob wa give free vodka and drug near the bu station rock be distribute in all part of town to be throw and use in fight so i think all of it wa arrange in advance they even know in which build and apartment the armenian live on which floor they have list the bandit you can tell that the operation wa plan in advance thank of course to my troop to the country leadership and to the leadership of the ministry of defense for help u thank to the russian person because the majority of the troop be russian and the troop suffer loss too i want to expres thi gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all armenian and in the name of all sumgait armenian for come in time and avert terrible thing worse would have happen if that mob have not be stop on time at present an investigation be be conduct on the part of the ussr procuracy i want to say that those bandit should receive the severest possible punishment because if they do the tragedy the genocide could happen again everyone should see that the most severe punishment be meted out for such deed very many bandit and harden hooligan take part in the unrest in the ma disturbance the mob be huge at present not all of them have be catch very few of them have be i think judge by the newspaper report there be around person near my build alone that how many person take part in the pogrom of my build all in all they should all receive the most severe punishment so that other see that retribution await those who perform such act may yerevan reference
