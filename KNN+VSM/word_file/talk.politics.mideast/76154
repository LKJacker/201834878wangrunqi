from aren yigal aren subject re ten question about israel in article backon write in article cpr center for policy research write is it true that in israeli prison there be a number of individual which be try in secret and for which their identity the date of their trial and their imprisonment be state secret apart from mordechai vanunu who have a trial behind close door there wa one other espionage case the nutty professor at the ne ziona biological institute who wa a mole who wa try in camera i would exactly call it a state secret the trial wa simply try behind close door i hate to disappoint you but the united state ha try a number of espionage case in camera at issue wa not a trial behind close door but arrest trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy thi wa appraently attempt in the case of vanunu and fail it ha happen before and there be reason to believe it still go on read thi from february possibly publication ban the state of israel ha never officially admit that for many year there have be in it prison israeli citizen who be sentence to long prison term without either the fact of their arrest or the crime of which they be accuse ever be make public by baruch all those involve in thi matter politely refuse my request one way or another look the subject be too delicate if i comment on it i will be implicitly admit that it be true if i mention a specific case even hint at it i might be guilty of make public something which may legally not be publish the state of israel ha never officially admit that for many year there have be in it prison israeli citizen who be sentence to long prison term without either the fact of their arrest or the crime of which they be accuse ever be make public more precisely a court order publication ban wa place on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment in israel of citizen be imprison without u the citizen of thi country know anything about it not know anything about the fact that one person or another be try and throw in prison for security offense in complete secrecy in the distant past for example during the day of the lavon ya affair we hear about the third man be in prison but many year have pass since then and what exist then can today no longer be find even in south american country or in the former communist country but it appear that thi be still possible in israel of the chair of the knesset committee on law the constitution and justice mk david zucker send a letter on thi subject early thi week to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor ha obtain the content of the letter during the past several year a number of israeli citizen have be imprison for variou period for security offense in some of these case a legal publication ban wa impose not only on the specific of the crime for which the prisoner be convict but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment in those case after be legally convict the prisoner spend their term in prison without public awarenes either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner assert mk zucker on the other hand zucker agree in hi letter that there be absolutely no question that it be possible and in some case it be imperative that a publication ban be impose on the specific of security offense and the course of trial but even in such case the court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstance under which a trial will not be hold in public however one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person arrest and on the name of a person sentence to prison be justify and appropriate in the state of israel the principle of public trial and the right of the public to know be not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and hi descent into the aby of prison zucker thu decide to turn to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor and request that they consider the question the state of israel be strong enough to withstand the cost incur by abide by the principle of public punishment the state of israel can not be allow to have prisoner whose detention and it cause be keep secret write zucker the legal counsel of the civil right union attorney mordechai shiffman say that we a the civil right union do not know of any case of security prisoner citizen of israel who be imprison and whose imprisonment can not be make public thi be a situation which if it actually exist be definitely unhealthy just like censorship be an unhealthy matter the union be aware say shiffman of case where notification of a suspect arrest to family member and lawyer be withhold i be speak only of several day i know also of case where a detainee wa not allow to meet with an attorney sometime for the whole first month of arrest that be do because of the great secrecy the suspect himself hi family hi lawyer or even a journalist can challenge the publication ban in court but there be case where the family member themself be not interest in publicity the journalist know nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone be happy attorney yossi arnon an official of the bar claim that give the law a they exist in israel today a situation where the arrest of a person for security offense be keep secret be definitely possible nothing be easier the court order a publication ban and that that someone who ha commit security offense can spend long year in prison without u know anything about it do you find thi situation acceptable attorney arnon definitely not we live in a democratic country and such a state of affair be impermissible i be well aware that publication can be damage from the standpoint of security but total non-publication silence be unacceptable consider the trial of mordechai vanunu at least in hi case we know that he wa charge with aggravate espionage and sentence to year in prison the trial wa hold behind close door nobody know the detail except for those who be authorize to it be somehow possible to understand though not to accept the reason but a i have note we at least be aware of hi imprisonment why be the matter actually that seriou ca we trust the discretion of the court attorney arnon the judge have no choice but to trust the presentation make to them the judge do not have the tool to investigate thi gife the government enormou power power which they can misuse and what if there really be a security issue attorney arnon i be a man of the legal system not a security expert democracy stand in opposition to security i believe it be possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charge without enter into detail we have already see how the law concern publication ban can be misuse in the case of the rachel heller murder a suspect in the murder wa hold for many month without the matter be make public attorney shiffman on the other hand believe that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibit publication of a suspect arrest or of a convict criminal imprisonment a healthy situation definitely not but i be aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security a different opinion be express by attorney urus shtendal former advisor for arab affair to prime minister levus eshkol and golda meir clearly we be speak of isolate special case such situation contrast with the principle that a judicial proceed must be hold in public no doubt thi contradict the principle of freedom of expression definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which be also harm by the prohibition of publication nevertheles add shtendal the legislator allow for the possibility of such a ban to accommodate special case where the damage possible a a consequence of publication be greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principle i mention the authority to decide such matter of publication do not rest with the prime minister or the security service but with the court which we may rest assure will authorize a publication ban only if it ha be convince of it need beyond a shadow of a doubt nevertheles attorney shtendal agree a a rule clearly such a phenomenon be undesirable such an extreme step must be take only in the most extreme circumstance yigal aren tv make me do it aren
