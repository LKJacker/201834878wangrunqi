from get thee to a nunnery subject re deir yassin hm write in article get thee to a nunnery write thi be such bullshit deir yassin wa an unprovoked attack on the part of the jew and a massacre define it best in my opinion the village of deir yassin have have a pact with the jew a peace pact but the irgun purposely break thi agreement in order to scare off the palestinian i might grant that thi village house arm arab i doubt it but nothing in the archive and available literature indicate that thi wa a motivate force amongst the irgun the deir yassin massacre wa part of an over all strategy to intimidate the palestinian to flee the jewish homeland and contrary to ymy belief many civilian be kill deir yassin wa later advertize by the very jew who perpetrate it because it wa useful in get many palestinian to leave the palestinian be rightfully scar off because they do not want another deir yassin i not necessarily condemn the israelite here atrocity be aslo commit on the part of the arab israelophile should just be careful in think that they be and be the good guy in the middle east both arab and jew suck equally you say that there be no evidence that what motivate the irgun to attack dir yassin wa it strategic importance in fact begin who wa in charge of the irgun write that dir yassin wa attack for it military significance dir yassin wa merely a battle in the war of liberation person die but the thing wa never intend to be a masacre that thi hapenned be a tragedy of war not a crime of the irgun harry i agree with you harry however you must also concede then that arab terrorism be also a tragedy of war remember that the palestinian have no other effective target but civilian in order to further their cause if irgun have to attack civilian target to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective i sure they would have do so i also do exclude irgun action against british soldier a terrorism the british be show sign of favor a compromise with regard to palestine and the irgun and branch off group make a point to kill young british recruit so that mother and father back in britain would get angry at britain continue presence in palestine sound like a form of terrorism to me and not much remove from arab terrorism we must not also forget that irgun or irgun branch off group more likely kill many jew who be not a hardline zionist a they or who cooperate with the british i reiterate again both side be screwy but i favor the underdog in thi case because i do think they be a bite screw
