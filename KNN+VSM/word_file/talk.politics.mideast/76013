every nation in the world would have treat a treasonable one readily reach the conclusion that the jew in turkey be fortunate he also state that they armenian traitorously turn turkish city over to

population turkey and the holocaust an interview with stanford j shaw history who recently complete two book the jew of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic and turkey and the holocaust turkey role in rescuing turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution shaw chair the undergraduate interdepartmental degree program in near eastern study and ha organize the program for the study of ottoman and turkish jewry he be affiliate with the g e von grunebaum center for near eastern study editor how do you come to write these two book on turkey and european and turkish jew shaw basically i an ottoman historian but i also jewish i spend twenty-five year study ottoman history and a time go along whenever i find material on the ottoman jew i collect them but i never do anything with them until a couple of year ago when i suddenly realize that wa the anniversary of the jew be expel from spain and come to turkey then the sephardic temple down on wilshire avenue invite me to give a series of three lecture on ottoman jewry these lecture be greatly appreciate and i become motivate to undertake further research to develop a book the jew of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic thi book be quite different from the work of most jewish historian who tend to look at the jew in any country more from the viewpoint of the jew and the jewish community and rely mainly on jewish source i view my subject a an ottoman historian and i approach the jew of the ottoman empire largely from the point of view of ottoman society use largely ottoman source after i finish thi book and send it to the pres i come acros additional document relate to turkish jew during world war ius in the complete book i have say that turkey have do a good deal to rescue the jew during world war ius but i do not actually have many detail then i find a batch of document in the foreign ministry archive relate to action take by turkish diplomat to help the jew before and during the holocaust it wa too late to add thi new information to the book in pres so i decide to write a second book i conduct further research mainly in the archive of the foreign ministry in ankara and the turkish embassy and consulate in pari the result wa the second book turkey and the holocaust which detail how turkey help rescue jew from the nazi how exactly do they do thi the story take place over a number of year the book present the material in three part first of which deal with the period before the holocaust when the nazi come to power in germany in they immediately start dismiss jew and anti-nazi german from university hospital scientific institute and the like turkey at that moment wa just begin the proces of reform it university and it saw in these jew who be be fire from their position in germany a good source of new talent to help modernize the turkish university within three month after the nazi start dismiss these jew turkey arrange to take many of them in they be bring to turkey and be give appointment a professor in the turkish university a head of scientific institute and a medical personnel in hospital about to major jewish professor come to turkey in the ernst reuter a german political scientist spend the war year teach political science in turkey after world war ius he wa mayor of berlin during the berlin airlift fritz neimark a major german jewish economist come to turkey and help establish a modern school of economic in istanbul a man name reichenbach who wa rescue from the nazi by turkey and spend the war year in turkey eventually come to ucla where he become a professor of philosophy other german jewish emigre engage in cultural activity in turkey one such wa karl ebert who have be a lead theatrical producer in berlin until he wa expel by the nazi he go to turkey where he organize the turkish national theater and the turkish national opus company in ankara with the help of paul hindemuth so the first section of the book cover thi first phase when jew be be persecute in germany and rescue by turkey oddly enough the german emigre when they be in turkey do not seem to think too badly of germany they regard themself more a german than jew and they do not join in the anti-nazi activity of the local turkish jewish community i even find letter from the nazi representative to turkey praise these german jewish refugee for their work in promote the idea of german culture even though these person have be persecute by the nazi and rescue by the turk they share the nazi feel of aryan racial superiority over the turk the second part of the book deal with the holocaust which begin in when the nazi occupy france in europe at that time and especially in france there be about turkish jew they have migrate to europe for variou reason from about the turn of the century onward most of them have settle in europe during the turkish war for independence after world war i when greece wa threaten to overrun turkey the greek have persecute the jew throughout the nineteenth century and the jew fear what might happen to them if the greek take over in turkey many jew flee to france during the and many also abandon their turkish citizenship and become french citizen suddenly the nazi invade france in and start introduce all sort of anti-jewish law the turkish jew soon find that it wa not worth very much to be a french jew but that it wa worth a lot to be a turkish jew how so turkey remain neutral through most of world war ius it retain it embassy and consulate in all the nazi-occupied country until it finally enter the war on the side of the ally at the end of during the war therefore turkey wa in a position to defend it citizen against anti-jewish measure and the action that turkish diplomat take form the second chapter of the book turkish diplomat who be station in france in particular intervene to protect jew of turkish citizenship from the nazi for those turkish jew who have retain their turkish citizenship there wa generally no problem if they be arrest and send to a concentration camp the turkish diplomat would communicate with the commander of the camp and other official and say in effect these person be turkish citizen you ca do thi to them and the turkish jew would be release if their business be confiscate the turkish diplomat would protest and the business would be restore the nazi in general want to keep the friendship of turkey they hop to be able to use turkey a a gateway for an invasion of the middle east and they also want to obtain chromium and manganese from turkey in order to keep turkish friendship they usually accept these intervention on behalf of turkish jew the turkish diplomat sometime go to the concentration camp to secure the release of turkish jew at time they even board train haul turkish jew to auschwitz for extermination and succeed in get them off the train most of the foreign jew be send to a concentration camp at a place call drancy in pari and that where most of the intercession by turkish consul take place the greater problem come with the turkish jew who have abandon their turkish citizenship and have become french citizen the consul could declare that these person be turkish citizen because they be not my book include photograph of jew line up in front of the turkish consulate either to get passport to return to turkey or to get a restoration of their turkish citizenship thi wa a bureaucratic matter so process the application would take some time in the meantime it wa a real emergency because the nazi would arrest jew on the street for almost nothing the nazi would even arrest them if they have radio or telephone in their apartment because radio and telephone be forbid to jew to take care of these former turkish jew the turkish diplomat invent a document call gayrus muntazem vatandash or irregular fellow citizen the document say in effect thi person be a former turkish citizen who ha apply for the restoration of hi turkish citizenship in the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat him a if he be a turkish citizen the diplomat write the document in turkish and put their seal on it since the nazi could not read turkish on the whole they accept these paper a certificate of citizenship by thi mean the turkish diplomat be able to rescue many jew who have relinquish their turkish citizenship actually the nazi be of two mind about the turkish defense of jew on the one hand the nazi foreign ministry which want to retain the friendship of turkey wa in favor of accept these intervention on the other hand himmler and eichmann want all jew exterminate at time himmler and eichmann be able to prevail and some of the turkish jew be send off to auschwitz before the turkish consul could do anything do you have statistic on how many turkish jew be rescue there be about turkish jew in europe before world war ius about of whom be live in france most of the information in thi section of the book relate to the situation in france i have publish the letter that the turkish consul send to the nazi official and the letter that come back in reply generally the nazi say that if the turkish consul would present document certify that arrest individual be turkish citizen and promise to send them out of france the nazi would release them from the concentration camp the turkish consul also organize special train to take turkish jew from nazi-occupied territory back to turkey these train run regularly in and the nazi give the turkish jew visa so they could pa out of nazi territory but the train be often hold up by the nazi-influenced government of eastern europe croatium serbium and bulgarium because these government really do want the jew to escape a a result of the turkish consul effort about to of the turkish jew in france be save another be send off to auschwitz where most of them die the remain either escape acros the border into spain or flee to the area of southern france occupy by the italian who treat jew much better than the nazi do at the end of however italy fell out of the war and that wa the end for those jew a well incidentally the turkish diplomat in nazi-occupied greece also work to rescue jew in that country the second part of ymy book then deal with turkish diplomat act to rescue jew of turkish citizenship or turkish origin from nazi persecution ye and there be an aside i might add here in their intervention on behalf of turkish jew the turk cite their treaty with germany which state that turkish citizen in german territory would be treat the same a german citizen in turkey on that basi the turk maintain that the nazi could not discriminate against turkish citizen who be jew the nazi claim and the vichy government agree that they be not discriminate because they be treat all jew equally turkey protest say you be divide my citizen accord to religion but the turkish constitution require that all citizen be treat equally regardles of religion therefore you can not single out turkish jew american consul in pari by contrast accept the nazi argument and tell american jew who be be persecute by the nazi that they could do anything about it because the american jew be be treat the same a other jew the third part of the book take place in turkey which wa the principal center during the holocaust for activity aim at the rescue of eastern european jew the kwish agency an organization establish by jew in palestine to help resettle jew to palestine set up an office in istanbul in under the leadership of chaim barla other jewish organization in palestine especially the kibbutze also send representative to istanbul to set up headquarter these group first try to contact jew in eastern europe to find out what wa happen today we know about the holocaust but at that time person do know what wa go on they do imagine the nazi could do the thing they be do and so the first step wa to get information and the turkish government let them use the turkish mail to send letter to their relative and friend in eastern europe the jewish organization find out what wa happen when they receive reply later on when the nazi begin to intercept such letter the jew receive assistance also from the vatican nuncio angelo roncali who serve a the vatican representative in istanbul from to and later become pope john xxiius a the vatican representative during the war he use the facility of the catholic church to supplement what the turkish government wa do to assist jewish agency in contact jew in eastern europe with the cooperation of the turkish government these agency then send hard currency food clothe and even railroad and steamship ticket to jew in czechoslovakium bulgarium romanium and hungary they be able to help much in poland because by then the nazi have wipe out almost all the polish jew whenever possible the rescue agency arrange for the jew to get out of eastern europe either by train through the so call orient expres route to istanbul or by boat through the black sea to istanbul turkey wa not eager for all these refugee to remain within it border during the war because it wa be blockade and wa suffer terrible shortage of food and clothe the government therefore facilitate the movement of the non-turkish jewish refugee from turkey to palestine either by the tauru expres railroad through the mountain to syrium and palestine or by small boat acros the eastern mediterranean from southern turkey to palestine these effort be bitterly oppose not only by the nazi but also by the british who do not want any more jewish immigration to palestine because they fear it would hurt their relation with the arab the british constantly pressure the turkish government to stop thi traffic and send those jew back in a few case the turkish government yield to british pressure do send the boat back for example in one incident the steamship struma with some jewish refugee from romanium wa send back by the turkish government a a result of the intervention of the british ambassador when that ship wa sink by a soviet submarine all be lose except one person nevertheles all tell the turkish government allow no fewer than eastern european jew to pa through turkish territory and move on to palestine during the second world war the turkish authority also provide these refugee with facility and money and give them permission to send money and food out of the country many of these jew who pass through turkey may still be live in israel ye and their child but let return for a moment to the first group the turkish jew who come from europe they do not go on to palestine they stay in turkey it wa the non-turkish eastern european jew who pass through turkey en route to palestine their story be very interest and you have rescue it from obscurity many study have be make of the holocaust but most of them do not focu on the eastern european or middle eastern jew most of the scholarship ha center on the western european jew of whom million be massacre by the nazi my study deal with a much smaller number of person i have try to round out the picture and i hope my book will persuade other scholar to undertake further investigation in the history of eastern jew when it come to number the german jew be also relatively small in number most of the million slay be polish jew the rescue of eastern european jew may not seem so significant compare with the total of million who be murder but it mean a lot to those who be save about three-fourth of the book consist of document translation of many document they be include because the story be not well know not only be person in the west unaware of the courageou action of the turkish diplomat even the person of turkey do not know the story i felt that they would not fully understand thi remarkable achievement unles they could see the document what language be use in the document most of them be in turkish or french some be in hebrew there be a great deal of material in hebrew about the organization of the boat go to palestine the passenger and so on but i do not go into those detail extensively i describe mostly what turkey do so most of my document be in turkish or french a few document be in english the jewish group in istanbul do not necessarily cooperate with one another to rescue jew in fact they often fight with one another they take turn try to get the turkish government to deport rival group for example some of the kibbutz group felt that the jewish agency wa run by western european jew who be interest only in help western european jew finally in president roosevelt send a personal representative ira hirschman who have be an executive of bloomingdale department store in new york city and hirschman manage to reconcile their difference the document relate to hi mission be in english i also obtain many document from serge klarsfeld a holocaust historian in france who mainly work on the french jew hi father wa kill by the nazi he give me material he have gather in the german archive on the turkish jew so i do personally consult the german archive i believe that much more can be learn from the german archive and i hope someone someday will make the effort thi new book fit in well with ymy teach do it right i give a course on the history of the jew of the ottoman empire i first give the course two year ago in addition to research write and teach i be actively involve in the commemoration of the anniversary of the come of the jew to the ottoman empire among other thing i help organize a large international
