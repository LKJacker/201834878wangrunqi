but now on the side with the microdistrict the bazaar and the rossiya movie theater i put outside clothe on and go out again there noise an uproar outside and the crowd ha grow there be more person and wherea the first time there be individual shout thi time they be more focus more aggressive no i think something wrong here thi be any demonstration they would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dash and then run again i wa walk along the sidewalk and they be in the street i follow them i wa think i just watch and see who know where thi wa lead we come out on lenin square at the square the sk club be on one side and the city party committee be on the other i go toward the square and hear noise and shout a though the whole town have turn out there wa some sort of a rally go on i go closer and hear exclamation appeal i hear both anti-armenian and anti-soviet appeal we do need perestroika we want to go on live like we have be now what do they mean by live like we have be the azerbaijani work like everyone else but too many person live at the expense of the government and at the expense of other speculation theft and cheat go on all the time and not just in azerbaijan everywhere in all the republic but i never see it anywhere else like i have in azerbaijan now at thi rally someone say that they should go around to the armenian apartment and drive them out beat them and drive them out true i do hear them say kill them over the microphone i only hear beat them and drive them out i stay at the square a few minute longer first one then another be go up onto the stage and no one try to stop the crowd off to the side of the crowd there be small group of three or fmy person and i think they be mvd ministry of internal affair or state security kgb there be also uniform policeman there but i do see any of them try to pacify the crowd new person keep come up onto the stage well i have finally decide that thi could end badly thi wa no demonstration and i have to protect my family i leave the square to return home and suddenly notice a truck it wa next to the city party committee on narimanov street it stand next to the tai lor shop there a low truck and it have low wooden panel i see that some thing be be unload crate of some sort i decide to go look because after all those appeal i wa apprehensive and think there might be weapon in there they pull the crate out onto the square not toward the city party committee but toward the sk club and when i go right up to them i saw that they be case of vodka there be two person hand down the case from the bed of the truck and on the grind there be many person to they be hand them down from the truck and each case wa carry off by two person two person one case of vodka and there wa a man stand right next to

a yard and a half between u and two person be stand near him he ha a package in hi hand and he pull out anasha and hand it out i have never smoke it myself once i try it for fun but i see a lot of person smoke it i see it many time and i know what it be i stroll around and no one ask me who i wa or what i wa do there before i get to the glas bazaar i hear more howl more warlike shout i turn around and saw them run well i just keep on go like i be i think when they catch up with me i saw that they be carry flag and i recognize the person who wa carry the flag on my side of the street he a young guy or year old he wa carry a red flag which have ermeni oryum write on it in azerbaijani that mean death to armenian that guy use to live off the same courtyard a u i do really know what hi

the leave now rafik little brother life there and he rafik i hear get a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict in a word hi son wa carry a flag that say death to armenian i wa

her it ok it pa they young kid they just get all whoop up naturally i do want her to get overly upset after a while a new surge of crowd go by and thi time they be break glas i could hear it break but i could see where well i think here we go the machine in motion they be hand out that vodka and anasha for nothing i do see person drink and smoke on the spot but they certainly have unload the vodka and hashish to put in a store window so the think flash through my head that the machine wa run no one would stop them now they be even try although i say it again the polouse be there i saw them and it not just that the polouse be break them up they be joke with them they be have a good time true at the time i could even imagine that under my government my much vaunt leadership and i not afraid to say these word so many person die so many woman be abuse and how many abomination there be i could imagine that under my much-vaunted authority and if i be to be specific i would say under the much-touted authority in my city of sumgait i could imagine that such thing could take place when they start break glas i tell my wife and son let go upstair we go to my neighbor the grigorian on the fourth floor and in the even when those crowd start go past again i go outside once more i stop at the corner a place call that right next to the bazaar i look and see a crowd on the run and there a few yard from the entrance to the bazaar be three respectable-looking man of around say year old the crowd wa run and one of the three wave with hi arm and point toward the bazaar and then the whole crowd a though it be one person wheel and race toward the bazaar and not a soul go past those three a though it be off limit well everything get all churn up there wa more noise and the glas wa fly again we spend the night at the neighbor my apartment wa on the first floor there wa really no way to defend yourself there in the morning i go out to buy bread and to see what wa happen in town on
