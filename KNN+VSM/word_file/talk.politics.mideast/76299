from hernlem brad hernlem subject re wa go hezbollah in article tclock tim clock write in article hernlem brad hernlem write in article tclock tim clock write are you suggest that when guerilla use the population for cover israel should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attack another be to use an innocent a a shield and hope that the other respect innocent life tell me tim what be these guerilla do wrong assuming that they be use civilian for cover assuming also come on brad if we be go to get anywhere in thi or any discussion it do help to bring up element i never address nor comment on in any way i make no comment on who be right or who be wrong only that civilian are be use a cover and that have be place in between the israeli and the guerilla they will be injure a both party continue their fight pardon me tim but i do not see how it can be possible for the idf to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for plant the bomb which kill the three idf troop and then later know the exact number and whereabout of all of them several village be shell how could the idf possibly have know that there be guerrilla in each of the targetted village you see it wa an arbitrary act of retaliation if the buffer zone be to prevent attack on israel be it not work why be it further neccessary for israeli gun to pound lebanese village why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there be more to the shell of the village it be call retaliation getting back getting even it do make sense to shell the village the least it show be a reckles disregard by the israeli government for the life of civilian i agree with you here i have alway think that israel bomb sortee and bomb policy be stupid thoughtles inhumane and ineffective but there be no reason that israel should passive wait until attacker choose to act there be every reason to believe that take the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attack a i say previously israel spend several decade sit passively on it side of a border and only act to stop these attack after the attacker have enter israeli territory it do work very well the host arab state do to try and stop these attack from it side of the border with israel so the number of attack be considerably higher a wa their physical and psychological impact on the civilian catch in their path the problem tim be that the original reason for the invasion wa palestinian attack on israel not lebanese attack what so the whole bite about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for thi to happen it will only occur when arab state show that they be prepare to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratee there be no way israel be go to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance toward anti-israel guerilla in-residence if israel be not will to accept the word of other then imho it ha no busines waste other time come to the peace talk thi be just another selectively apply statement the reason for thi drawn-out impasse between and israeli be that neither side be will to accept the word of the other by ymy criterium everyone should stay away from the negotiation that be precisely why the palestinian in their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiation and lead up to full autonomy be demand condition that essentially define autonomy already they do not trust that israel will follow through the entire proces and allow palestinian to reach full autonomy do you understand and accept thi viewpoint by the palestinian if you do then why should israel view of be any different why should they trust the word since they do they be very reluctant to give up tangible asset land control of area in exchange for word for thi reason they be also concern about the sort of guarantee they will have that the arab will follow through on their part of any agreement reach first i believe that my statement apply to both side having say that i think it be neccessary to separate what be legitimately negotiable and what be not for example no country ha the right to abuse one human right deciding whether there will be one or two state in palestine be a legitimate question while de facto one state exist israel must treat all within it domain equitably tim you be ignore the fact that the palestinian in lebanon have be disarm hezbollah remain the only independent militium hezbollah do not attack israel except at a few time such a when the idf burn up sheikh mosavus hi wife and young son while the major armament those allow person to wage civil war have be remove the weapon need to cross-border attack still remain to some extent rocket attack still continue and commando raid only require a few easily conceal weapon and a refine disregard for human life your of that of other such attack also continue ye i be afraid that what you say be true but that still do not justify occupy ymy neighbor land israel must resolve it dispute with the native palestinian if it want peace from such attack of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinate person and shell village they would make the lebanese so mad a to do that bat guano the situation you call for exist in the and attack be commonplace not true lebanese be not attack israel in the with a strong lebanese government free from syrian and israeli interference i believe that the border could be adequately patrol the palestinian heavy weapon have be siezed in past year and i do not see a significant a threat a once exist please tim do fall into the trap of treat lebanese and palestinian a all part of the same group there be too many who think all arab or all muslim be the same too many time i have see person support the bomb of palestinian camp in retaliation for an idf death at the hand of the lebanese resistance or the shell of lebanese village in retaliation for a palestinian attack tim
