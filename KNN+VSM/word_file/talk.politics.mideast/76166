from nstramer naftaly stramer subject the hama way of death the hama way of death following be a transcript of a recruitment and train videotape make last summer by the qassam battalion the military arm of hama an islamic palestinian group hama figure significantly in the middle east equation in december israel deport more than palestinian to lebanon in response to hama kidnap and execution of an israeli soldier a longer version appear in the may issue of harper magazine which obtain and translate the tape my name be yasir hammad al-hassan ali i live in nuseirat a refugee camp in the gaza strip i wa bear in i finish high school then attend gaza polytechnic later i go to work for islamic university in gaza a a clerk i marry and i have two daughter the qassam battalion be the only group in palestine explicitly dedicate to jihad holy war my primary concern be palestinian who collaborate with the enemy many young man and woman have fall prey to the cunning trap lay by the israeli security service since my enemy be try to obliterate my nation cooperation with them be clearly a terrible crime my most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration to do so we abduct collaborator intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborator and expose the method that the enemy use to lure palestinian into collaboration in the first place in addition to that naturally we confront the problem of collaborator by execute them we do execute every collaborator after all about percent of them be innocent victim trick or black-mailed into their misdeed the decision whether to execute a collaborator be base on the seriousnes of hi crime if like many collaborator he ha be recruit a an agent of the israeli border guard then it be imperative that he be execute at once he a dangerou a an israeli soldier so we treat him like an israeli soldier there another group of collaborator who perform an even more loathsome role the one who help the enemy trap young man and woman in blackmail scheme that force them to become collaborator i regard the isqat the proces by which a palestinian be blackmail into collaboration of single person a greater crime than the kill of a demonstrator if someone be guilty of cause repeat case of isqat than it be my religiou duty to execute him a third group of collaborator be responsible for the distribution of narcotic they work on direct order from the security service to distribute drug a widely a possible their victim become addict and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more they collaborate in order to get the drug they crave the dealer must also be execute in the battalion we have develop a very careful method of uncover collaborator we ca afford to abduct an innocent person because once we seize a person hi reputation be tarnish forever we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of hi guilt ha be establish never before if after interrogation the collaborator be find guilty beyond any doubt then he be execute in many case we do have to make my evidence against collaborator public because everyone know that they guilty but when the public be aware that a certain individual be a collaborator and we accuse him person be bind to ask for evidence many person will proclaim hi innocence so there must be irrefutable proof before he be execute thi proof be usually obtain in the form of a confession at first every collaborator deny hi crime so we start off by show the collaborator the testimony against him we tell him that he still ha a chance to serve hi person even in the last moment of hi life by confess and give u the information we need we say that we know hi repentance in sincere and that he ha be a victim that kind of talk be convince most of them confes after that other hold out in those case we apply pressure both psychological and physical then the holdout confes a well only one collaborator ha ever be execute without an interrogation in that case the collaborator have be see work for the border guard since before the intifada and he himself confess hi involvement to a friend who disclose the information to u in addition three member of hi network of collaborator tell u that he have cause their isqat with thi much evidence there wa no need to interrogate him but we be very careful to avoid wrongful execution in every case my principal be the same the accuse should be interrogate until he himself confess hi crime a few week ago we sit down and comply a list of collaborator to decide whether there be any who could be execute without interrogation an although we have hundred of name still because of my fear of god and of hell we could not mark any of these man except for the one i just mention for execution when we execute a collaborator in public we use a gun but after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator we ca shoot him to do so might give away my location that why collaborator be strangle sometime we ask the collaborator what do you think how should we execute you one collaborator tell u strangle me he hat the sight of blood naftaly stramer intergraph
