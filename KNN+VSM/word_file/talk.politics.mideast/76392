but do write it down and lead him on i do know where they be take him then they put my stretcher near where the injure and beat soldier be sit they go to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer one of the soldier start talk to me sister i do remember the conversation exactly but he ask me be we live and what they do to u i ask him where be you from he say that he wa from ufa apparently they be the first that be bring in the ufa polouse later i learn that they suffer most of all he say ok you armenian they do get along with you but i a russian he say what be they try to kill me for oh i remember something else when i go out onto the balcony with kuliyev for a hammer and nail i look out the window and saw two azerbaijani beat a soldier near the kindergarten he wa press against the fence and he cover hi head with hi arm they be beat him with hi own club the way he cry mamma make my skin crawl i do know what they do to him if he still alive or not and something else before he attack on my house we saw sheet clothe and some dish fly from the third or fourth floor of the neighbor build but i do think it wa azerbaijani attack armenian i think that something wa on fire or they be throw something they do need out or someone wa fight with someone it wa only later when they be burn a passenger car in the yard when the neighbor say that they be do that to the armenian that i realize that thi wa seriou that it wa anti-armenian they take karina and me to the sumgait maternity home mamma go to them too and say i be beat too help me but they just ignore her my father go to them and say in a guilty voice a though it wa hi fault that he be beat and say my rib hurt so much those creep have probably break my rib please look at them the doctor say that not my job urshan say fine i take you to my place and if we need a doctor i find you one i bring one and have him look at you and he drive them to hi apartment marina and i stay there they examine u i wa more strike by what the doctor say than by what those azerbaijani in my apartment do to u i wa surprise when they beat u they want to beat u but i wa very surprise that in a soviet medical facility a woman who have take the hippocratic oath could talk to victim like that by happy or unhappy coincidence we be see by the doctor that have deliver my karina and she have examine karina say no problem you get off pretty good not like they do in kafan when you armenian be kill and rap my woman karina wa in such terrible condition that she could say anything she would certainly have have something to say then they examine me the same story they put u in a separate ward no shoot no medicinal powder no drug absolutely none they do even give u tea all the woman there soon find out that in ward such and such be armenian who have be rap and they start come and peer through the keyhole the way person look at zoo animal karina do see thi she wa lie there and i keep her from see it they put ira b in my ward she have also be rap true she do have any seriou bodily injury but when she tell me what have happen at their place i felt worse for them than i do for u because when they rap ira her daughter wa in the room she wa under the bed on which it happen and ira wa hold her daughter hand the one who wa hide under the bed when they be beat ira or take her earring off gold when she involuntarily let go of her daughter hand her daughter take her hand again her daughter be in the fourth grade she year old i felt really awful when i hear that ira ask them not to harm her daughter she say do what you want with me just leave my daughter alone well they do what they want they threaten to kill her daughter if she get in their way now i would be surprise if the criminal have behave any other way that night it wa simply bartholomew night i say they do what they would love to do every day steal kill rape many be surprise that those animal do harm the child the beast explain it like thi thi would be repeat in to year and those child would be grow and then a they put it we come take the pleasure out of their life those child thi wa about the girl that would be young woman in year they be think about their tomorrow because they be sure that there would be no trial and no investigation just a there wa no trial or investigation in and that those girl could be of some use in year thi i hear from the investigator one of the victim testify to it that how they describe their own nature that they would still be bloodthirsty in to year and in year they themself say that and thi too everyone be surprise that they do harm my marina many person say that they either be drink or have smoke too much i do know why their eye be red maybe because they have sleep the night before maybe for some other reason i do know but they have be smoke and they be drink i positive because someone who ha smoke will stop at nothing he ha the urge to do and they speak in a culture fashion with marina little sister do be afraid we wo harm you do look over there where i wa you might be frighten you a muslim a muslim woman should see such thing so they be really quite sober so we come out of that story alive each every day we have live since it all happen bear the mark of that day it wa even a day of those several hour father still ca look u in the eye he still feel guilty for what happen to karina mother and me because of hi nerve he start talk ing to himself i hear him argue with himself several time when he think no one be listen listen he say what could i do what could i do alone how could i protect them i do know where to find the word it not that i happy but i be glad that he do see it all happen that the only thing they spar u or maybe it happen by chance of course he know it all but there no way you could imagine every last detail of what happen and there be so many conversation karina and i speak together in private and we talk with mamma too but father wa never present at those conversation we spare him that if you can say that and when the investigator come to the house we do speak with father present on february the next clay karina and i be discharge from the hospital first they release me but since martial law have be declare in the city the soldier take me to the polouse precinct in an armor personnel carrier there be many person there armenian victim i meet the tovmasian family there from them i learn that rafik and their uncle grant have die they be sure that both have die they be talk to me and raya rafik wife and grant daughter and her mother be both cry then they take u all out of the office on the first floor into the yard there a little one-room house outside there a recreation and read area they take u in there the woman be afraid to go because they think that they be shoo u out of the polouse precinct because it have become so dangerou that even the person work at the precinct want to hide the woman be shout they explain to them we want to hide you better because it possible there will be an attack on the polouse precinct we go into the little house there be no chair or table in there we have child with u and they be hungry we even have infant who need to have their diaper change no one have anything with them it wa just awful they keep u there for hour from the window of the one room house you could see that there be azerbaijani stand on the fence around the polouse precinct a though they be spy on u the polouse precinct be surround by a wall like a fence and it electrify but if they be stand on the wall it mean the electricity wa shut off thi bring great psychological pressure to bear on u particularly on those who have just walk out of their apartment but who have sleep for hour or or those who have suffer physically and spiritually the one who have lose family member for u it wa another ordeal we be especially frighten when all the precinct employee suddenly disappear we could see a single person not in the courtyard and not in the window we think that they must have already be hide under the build that they must have some secret room down there person be panic they start throw themself at one another that the way it be on a sink ship we hear those person mainly young person whistle and whop on the wall we felt that the end wa approach i wa completely terrify i have leave karina in the hospital and do know where my parent be i wa sort of calm about my parent i wa think only about karina if heaven forbid they should attack the hospital they would immediately tell them that there wa an armenian in there and something terrible would happen to karina again and she would be able to take it then soldier with dog appear when they saw the dog some of the person climb down off the fence then they bring in about another soldier they all have machine gun in readines their finger on the trigger we calm down a little they bring u chair and bring the child some little cot and show u where we could wash my hand and take the child to the toilet but we all sit there hungry but to be honest it would never have occur to any of u that we have eat for two day and that person do eat then closer to nightfall they bring a group of detain criminal they be be watch by soldier with guard dog one of the man come back from the courtyard and tell u about it raya tovmasian it wa like a different woman have be substitute earlier she have be cry wail and call out oh rafik but when she hear about thi such a rage come over her she jump up she have a coat on and she start to roll up her sleeve like she wa get ready to beat someone and suddenly there be soldier and dog and lot of person she run over to them the bandit be stand there with their hand above their head face the wall she go up to one of them and grab him by the collar and start to shake and thrash him then on to a second and a third everyone wa root to the spot not one of the soldier move no one go up to help or make her stop her from do it and the bandit fell down and cover their head with their hand mutter something she come back and sit down and something akin to a smile appear on her face she become so quiet no tear no cry then that round wa over and she go back to beat them again she wa walk and curse terribly take that and that they kill my husband the bastard the creep and so on then she come back again and sit down she probably do thi the whole night through well it wa really night no one sleep she go five or six time and beat them and return and she tell the woman what be you sit there for they kill ymy husband and child they rap and you just sit there you sit and talk a though nothing have happen are you armenian she appeal to everyone but no one get up i wa just numb i do have the strength to beat anyone i could barely hold myself up all the more so since i have be stand for so many hour i wa release at eleven in the morning and it wa already after ten at night because there be enough chair really it wa the elderly and woman with child who sit i wa on my foot the whole time there wa nothing to breathe the door wa close and the man be smoke the situation wa deplorable at eleven at night policeman come for u local policeman azerbaijani they say get up they bring mattress you can wash up and put the child to bed now the woman do want to leave thi place either the place have become like home it wa safe there be soldier with dog if anyone go outside the soldier would say oh it my little family and thing like that the soldier felt thi love and probably for the first time in their life perceive themself a defender everyone speak from the heart cry and hug them and they with their load machine gun in their hand say grandmother you must approach me i on guard my person would say oh that all right they hug them one woman even kiss one of the machine gun thi wa all terribly move for me and the small child keep want to pet the dog they take u up to the second floor and say you can undres and sleep in here do be afraid the precinct be on guard and it quiet in the city thi wa the when the kill wa go on in block and in other place then we be tell that all the armenian be be gather at the sk club and at the city party committee they take u there on the way i ask them to stop at the maternity home i want to take karina with me i do know what wa happen there they tell me do worry the maternity home be full of soldier more than mother-to-be so you can rest assure i say well i wo rest assure regardles because the staff in there be capable of anything when i arrive at the city party committee it turn out that karina have already be bring there they have see fit to release her from the hospus tal decide that she felt fine and wa no longer in need of any care once we be in the city party committee we give free reign to my tear we meet acquaintance but everyone wa somehow divide into two group those who have be injure who be clothe who have bring a pot of food with them and so on and those like me like raya who be wear whatever have come their way there be even person who be all make up dolled up like they have come from a wed there be person without shoe naked person hungry person those who be cry and those who have lose someone and of course the story and the talk be fly oh i hear that they kill him what do you mean they kill him he stay at work do you know what happen at thi and such a plant talk like that and then i meet aleksandr mikhailovich gukasian the teacher i know him very well and respect him highly i know him for a long time they have a small room well really it wa more like a study-room we spend a whole night talk in that study once on march we hear that bagirov first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr have arrive everyone run to see bagirov what news he have bring with him and how thi wa all be view from outside he arrive and everyone go up to him to talk to him and ask him thing everyone wa in a tremendou rage but he wa protect by soldier and he go up to the second floor and do deign to speak with the person apparently he have more important thing to do several hour pass gukasian call me and say lyudochka find another two or three we go to make up list they ask for them upstair list of the dead those whose whereabout be unknown and list of person who have pogrom of their apartment and of those whose car be burn i have about person in my list when they call me and say lyuda ymy mamma ha arrive she look for you she do believe that you be alive and well and that you here i give the list to someone and ask them to continue what i wa do and go off the list wa imprecise of course it include grant adamian raya tovmasian father who wa alive but at the time they think him dead there wa engel grigorian father and aunt cherkez and marium the list also include the name of my girlfriend and neighbor zhanna agabekian one of the guy say that he have be tell that they chop her head off in the courtyard in front of the kosmo movie theater we put her on the list too and cry but later it turn out that that wa just a rumor that in fact an hmy earlier she have somehow leave sumgait for the marina and from there have set sail for krasnovodsk where thank god she wa alive and well i should also say that in addition to those who die that list contain person who be rumor miss or who be so badly wound that they be give up for dead all the list be take to bagirov i do remember how many dead be contain in the list but it a fact that when gukasian come in a couple of minute later he wa curse and wa terribly irate i ask what go on he say lyuda can you imagine what animal what scoundrel they be they say that they lose the list of the dead piotr demichev member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr ha just arrive and we be suppose to submit the list to him so that he see the scope of the slaughter of the tragedy whether it wa one or fifty they tell him that the list have disappear and they should ask everyone who have leave for the khimik board house all over again there be person on my second list i think that the number wa the one that get into the pres and onto television and the radio because that the list that demichev get i remember exactly that there be person on the list i have even tell aleksandr mikhailovich that that wa only a half of those that be on the first list he say lyuda please try to remember at least one more but i could remember anyone else but there be more than dead of that i be certain the government and the procuracy do count the person who die of fright like sick person and old person whose life be threaten by any shock they be register a victim of the sumgait tragedy and then there may be person we do know so many person leave sumgait between march and most of them leave for smaller town in russium and especially to the northern caucasu to stavropol and the krasnodarsk territory we do have any information on them i know that there be person who set out for part around moscow in the periodical krestyanka woman farmer there wa a call for person who know how to milk cow and for mechanic and driver and i know a whole group of person go to help out also clearly not on my list be those person who die enter the city who be burn in their car no one know about them except the azerbaijani who be hardly likely to say anything about it and there more a great many of the person who be rap be not include in the list draw up at the procuracy i know of three instance for sure and i of course do know them all i think of three woman whose parent choose not to publicize what have happen that be they do take the matter to court they simply leave but in so do they do cease be victim one of them be the first cousin of my classmate kocharian she live in microdistrict no on the fifth floor i ca tell you the build number and i do know her name then come the neighbor of one of my relative she live in microdistrict near the gift shop i do know her name she life on the same land a the sumgait procurator they beat her father he wa hold the door while hi daughter hide but he could hold the door forever and when she climb over the balcony to the neighbor they seize her by her braid like the azerbaijani be say it wa a very culture mob because they do kill anyone they only rap them and leave and the third one i do remember who the third one wa anymore they transfer u on march karina still wa herself ye we live for day in the sk in the cultural facility and at the khimik they live there and i live at the city party committee because i could stay with karina it wa too difficult for me but i wa at peace she have survive i could already walk but really it wa honest word that hold me up thank to the social work i do there i manage to persevere aleksandr mikhailovich say if it be for the work i would go insane he and i put ourself in gear and take everything upon ourself someone have an infant and need diaper and free food and we go to get them the first day we buy everything although we should have receive it for free they be suppose to have be dispense free of charge and they sell it to u then when we find out it wa free we go to krayev at the time fortunately you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor all the more so since everything wa still clearly visible on my face krayev send a captain down and he resolve the issue on march they send two investigator to see u andrei shirokov and vladimir fedorovich bibishev the way it work out in my family they have consider only karina and me victim maybe because she and i wind up in the hospital mother and father be consider witness but not victim shirokov wa involve with karina case and bibishev with mine after i tell him everything he and i plan to sit down with the identikit and record everyone i could remember while everything wa still fresh in my mind we do work with the identikit until the very last day because the condition be there the investigative group work slowly and do poor quality work solely because the situation wa conducive to work there be enough automobile especially during the time when there wa a curfew and there be no typewriter for type transcript and no still or video camera i think that thi wa do on purpose we not so poor that we ca supply my investigator with all that stuff it wa do especially to draw out the investigation all the more so since the local authority saw that the armenian be leave at the speed of light never to return to sumgait and the armenian have a lot to say i come to an agreement with bibishev i tell him myself do you worry if it take u a month or two month i be here i not afraid i look death in the eye five time in those two day i help you conduct the investigation he and i work together a great deal and i use thi to shelter karina i give them so much to do that for a while they do have the time to get to her so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to be her self she wa have difficulty breathe so we look for a doctor to take x ray she could eat or drink for nine day she wa nauseou i do eat and drink virtually nothing for five day then on the fifth day when we be in baku already the investigator tell me how long can you go on like thi well fine so you do want to eat you do love yourself you not take care of yourself but you give ymy word that you would see thi investigation through we need you then i start eat because in fact i wa exhaust it wa enough that i keep see those face in my apart ment in my mind every day i go to the investigative solitary confinement cell and prison i do know we be just everywhere probably in every prison in the city of baku and in all the solitary confinement cell of sumgait at that time they have even turn the drink tank into solitary confinement thu far i have identify of the person who be in my apartment mamma identify three and karina two the total be marina do identify anyone she remember the face of two or three but they be among the photograph of those detain i tell of the neighbor i recognize the one who go after the axe he still ha be detain he still on the loose he go and it not clear if he will be find or not i do know hi first or last name i know which build he live in and i know hi sister face but he not in the city the investigator inform me that even if the investigation be close and even if the trial be over they will continue look for him the person i identify be largely blue-collar worker from variou plant without education and of the very lowest level in every respect mostly their age range from to year there wa one who wa only one of them wa a student he wa attend the azerbaijan petroleum and chemical institute in sumgait hi mother keep try to bribe the investiga tor once think that i wa an employee and not a victim she say in front of me i set you up a restaurant worth ruble and give you in cash simply for keep him out of armenium that be to keep him from land in a prison on armenian soil they all terribly afraid of that because if the investigator be talk with a criminal and the criminal do confes even though we identify him they tell him in order to apply psychological pressure they say fine do confes just keep silent when you in an armenian prison when they find out who you be they take care of you in short order that somehow get to them many give in and start to talk the investigator and i be in my apartment and videotape the entire pogrom of my apartment a an investigative experiment it wa only then that i saw the way they have leave my apartment even without know who wa in my apartment you could gues they steal for example all the money and all the valuable but do take a single book they tear them up burn them pour water on them and hack them with axe only the material from the congres of the communist party of the soviet union and jame fenimore cooper last of the mohigan oh ye lunch wa ready we be boil a chicken and there be lemon for tea on the table after they have be in my apartment both the chicken and the lemon be go that enough to tell you what kind of person be in my apartment person who do even know anything about book they do take a single book but they do take wear clothe food and even the cheapest of the cheap worn-out slipper of those whom i identify fmy be kafan azerbaijani live in sumgait basically the group that go seek revenge let use their word for it wa join by person seek easy gain and thrill-seeker i talk with one of them he have gray eye and somehow against the back-drop of all that black i remember him specifically because of hi of hi eye beside take part in the pogrom of my apartment he wa also involve in the murder of tamara mekhtiyeva from building she wa an older armenian who have recently arrive from georgia she live alone and do not have anyone in sumgait i do know why she have a last name like that maybe she wa marry to an azerbaijani i have lay eye on thi woman only once or twice and know nothing about her i do know that they murder her in her apartment with an axe murdering her wa enough for them they hack her into piece and throw them into the tub with water i remember another guy really well too he wa also rather fair-skinned you know all the person who be in my apartment be darker than dark both their hair and their skin and in contrast with them in addition to the grey eye one i remember thi one fellow the one l take to be a lezgin i identify him a it turn out he wa eduard robertovich grigorian bear in the city of sumgait and he have be convict twice one of my own how do i remember him the name ritum wa tattoo on hi leave or right hand i keep think be that ritum or puma which it would be if you read the word a latin character instead of cyrillic because the cyrillic t wa the one that look like a latin m when they lead him in he sit with hi hand behind hi back thi wa at the confrontation he swear on every holy book try to put in an armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion and tell me that i wa make a mistake and call me dear sister he say you wrong how could i an armenian raise my hand against my own an armenian and so on he speak so convincingly that even the investigator ask me lyuda be you sure it wa he i tell him i tell you one more identify mark if i wrong i shall apologize and say i wa mistake the name ritum be tattoo on hi leave or right hand he go rigid and become pale they tell him put ymy hand on the table he put hi hand on the table with the palm up i say now turn ymy hand over but he do turn hi hand over now thi infuriate me if he have from the very start acknowledge hi guilt and say that he have want to do it that they force him or something else i would have treat him somewhat differently but he insolently stick to hi story no i do not do anything it wa me when they turn hi hand over the name ritum wa in fact tattoo on hi hand hi face distort and he whisper something wicked i immediately fly into a rage there wa an ashtray on the table a really heavy one make out of granite or something very large and it have ash and butt in it catching myself quite by surprise i hurl that ashtray at him but he duck and the ashtray hit the wall and ash and butt rain down on hi head and back and he smile when he smile it provoke me further i do know how but i jump over the table between u and start either pound him or strangle him i no longer remember which when i jump i catch the microphone cord the investigator wa there tolya i no longer recall hi last name and he say lyudochka it a japanese microphone please and shut off all the equipment on the spot it wa all be video tap they take him away i stay and they talk to me a little to calm me down because we need to go on work i only remember tolya tell me you some actres what a performance i say tolya honestly beforehand they would alway tell me lyuda more emotion you speak a calmly a if nothing have happen to you i say i do have any more strength or emotion all my emotion be behind me now i no longer have the strength i do have the strength to do anything and he say lyuda how be you able to do that and when i return to normal drink tea and watch the tape i say can i really have jump over that table i never jump that high in gym clas so you could say the gang that take over my apartment wa international of the we identify there wa an armenian a russian vadim vorobyev who beat mamma and azerbaijani at the second meet with grigorian when he have completely confess hi guilt he tell of how on february the azerbaijani have come knock among them be guy if you can call them guy he know from prison they say tomorrow we go after the armenian meet u at the bu station at three he say no i not come they tell him if you do come we kill you he say alright i come and he go they also go to visit my classmate from my microdistrict kamo pogosian he have also be in prison i think that together they have either steal a motorcycle or dismantle one to get some part they need they call him out of hi apartment and tell him the same thing tomorrow we go to get the armenian be there he say no they pull a knife on him he say i not go all the same and in the courtyard on the they stab him several time in the stomach he wa take to the hospital i know he wa in the hospital in baku in the republic hospital if we have know about that we would have have some idea of what wa to come on the i return to grigorian what he do in my apartment i remember that he beat me along with all the rest he speak azerbaijani extremely well but he wa very fair-skinned maybe that lead me to think that they have it out for him too but later it wa prove that he take part in the beat and burn of shagen sargisian i do know if he participate in the rape in my apartment i do see i do remember but the person who be in my apartment who do yet know that he wa an armenian say that he do i do know if he confess or not and i myself do recall because i black out very often but i think that he do participate in the rape of karina because he wa in the apartment the whole time when they carry her into the courtyard he remain in the apartment at one point i wa talk with an acquaintance about edik grigorian from her i learn that hi wife wa a dressmaker hi mother be russian he do have a father and that he be convict twice well thi will be hi third and i hope last sentence he beat hi wife she wa eternally come to work with bruise hi wife wa an armenian by the name of ritum the other who be detain well they little beast you really ca call them beast they just little beast they be robot carry out someone else will because at the investigation they all say i do understand how i could have do that i wa out of my head but we know that they be win around to it and prepare for it that why they do it in the name of allah in the name of the koran in the name of propagate islam that holy to them that why they do everything they be command to do because i saw they do have mind of their own i not talk about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher value no education they work have a slew of child without the mean to raise them properly they crowd them in like at the temporary house and apparently they be promise that if they slaughter the armenian they would receive apartment so off they go many of them explain their participation say they promise u apartment among them wa one who genuinely repent i be sure that he repent from the heart and that he just despise himself after the incident he work at a child home an azerbaijani he ha two child and hi wife work at the child home too everything that they acquire everything that they have they earn by their own labor and wa inherit from parent or grandparent and he say i do need anything i just do know how i end up in that it wa like some hand wa guide me i have no will of my own i have no strength no masculine dignity nothing and the whole time i keep repeat now you imagine that someone do the same to ymy young wife right before ymy own eye he sit there and just wail but that leader in the eskimo dogskin coat wa not detain he perform a marvelou disappear act but i think that they get onto him they just have to work a little because that vadim that boy accord to hi grandfather be in touch with the young person who teach him what to do how to cover hi track he wa constantly exchange jacket with other boy he know and those he do either and other thing a well and change himself like a chameleon so they would get onto him but he wa detain that one in the eskimo dogskin coat wa at the gambarian after aleksandr gambarian wa murder he come in and say let go enough you spill enough blood here maybe karina do know thi but the reason they do finish her off wa that they be hop to take her home with them i hear thi from aunt tanya and her son the kasumov who be in the courtyard near the entryway they like her very much and they have decide to take her to home with them when karina come to at one point she do remember thi yet thi the neighbor old me and she saw that there wa no one around her she start crawl to the entryway they saw that she wa still alive and come back they be already at the third entryway on their way to the gambarian they come back and start beat her to finish her if she have not come to she would have sustain lesser bodily injury they would have beat her le an older woman from my build aunt nazan an azerbaijani all but lay on top of karina cry and plead that they leave her alone but they fling her off the woman grow son be right nearby they pick her up in their hand and lead her home she howl and cry out loudly and swear god be on earth he see everything and he wo forgive thi there wa another woman too aunt fatima a sick age woman from the first floor she already retire mountain dweller and azerbaijani too have a custom if man be fight they throw a scarf under their foot to stop them but they trample her scarf and send her home to trample a scarf be tantamount to trample a woman honor now that the investigation be go on now that a lot be behind u and we have get back to be ourself a little i think about how could these event that be now call the sumgait tragedy happen how do they come about how do it start could it have be avoid well it clear that without a signal without permission from the top leadership it would not have happen all the same i not afraid to say thi the azerbaijani let other worthy person take no offense the better representative of their nation let them take no offense but the azerbaijani in their majority be a person who be keep in line only by fear of the law fear of retribution for what they have do and when the law say that they could do all that like unleash dog who be afraid they would have time to do everything they throw themself from one thing to the next so a to be able to get more do to snatch a bite more the smell of the danger wa already in the air on february you could tell that something wa go to happen and everyone who have figure it out take step to avoid run into those gang many leave for their dacha get plane ticket for the other end of the country just get a far away a their leg would carry them february wa a saturday i wa teach my third clas the director come into my classroom and say that i should let the child out that there have be a call from the city party committee ask that all teacher gather for a meet at lenin square well i excuse the child and there be few teacher leave at school altogether three woman the director and six or seven man the rest have already go home we get to lenin square and there be a great many person there thi wa around five-thirty or six in the even no later they be say all kind of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below wa support them stormily roar they speak over the microphone about what have happen in kafan a few day earlier and that the driver of a bu go to some district have recently throw a small azerbaijani child off the bu the speaker affirm that he wa an eyewitnes that he have see it crowd start to rage death to the armenian they must be kill then a woman go up on stage i do see the woman because person be cling to the podium like fly i could only hear her the woman introduce herself a come from kafan and say that the armenian cut her daughter breast off and call son avenge my daughter that wa enough a portion of the person on the square take off run in the direction of the factory toward the begin of lenin street we stand there about an hmy then the director of school speak he give a very nationalist speech he say brother muslim kill the armenian thi he repeat every other sentence when he say thi the crowd support him stormily whistle and shout karabagh he say karabagh ha be my territory my whole life long karabagh be my soul how can you tear out my heart a though an azerbaijani would die without karabagh it my territory the armenian will never see it the armenian must be eliminate from time immemorial muslim have cleanse the land of infidel armenian from time immemorial that the way nature create it that every to year the azerbaijani should cleanse the land of filth by filth he mean armenian i hear thi before that i have be listen to the speech closely many person speak and i stand with my back to the podium talk shop with the other teacher and somehow it all go right by it do penetrate that in fact something seriou wa take place then when one of my teacher say listen to what he say listen to what idiocy he spout we listen that wa the speech of that director before that we listen to the woman speech right then in my group there be nine of u the mood change and the subject of conversation and all school matter be forget my director of study for whom i have great respect he an azerbaijani before that i have consider him an upstanding and worthy person if there wa a need to obtain leave we have ask him he seem like a good person so he tell me lyuda you know that beside you there be no armenian on the square if they find out that you an armenian they tear you to piece should i tell them you an armenian should i tell them you an armenian when he say it the first time i pretend not to hear it and then he ask me a second time i turn to the director khudurova and say that it wa already after eight i wa expect at home and i should be leave she answer no they say that woman should stay here until ten and man until twelve stay here there wa a young teacher with u her child be in kindergarten and her husband work shift she ask to leave i leave my child at the kindergarten the director excuse her when she let her go i turn around say good-bye and leave with the young teacher the azerbaijani i do see them after that when we be walk the bus be run and a crowd from the rally run nearby u they have apparently get all fire up it must have become too much for them and they want to seek vengeance immediately so they rush off i wa afraid thi time because i wa sure that the other teacher would say that i wa an armenian to make it short we reach home then karina tell of how they have be at the movie and what have happen there i start tell of my experience and again my parent do understand that we be in danger we watch television a usual and do even imagine that tomorrow would be my last day that how it all wa at the city party committee i meet an acquaintance we go to school together zhanna i do remember her last name she life above the houseware store on narimanov street she wa there with her father for some reason she do have a mother the two of them be at home alone while her father hold the door she jump from the third floor and she wa lucky that the grind wa wet and that there wa anyone behind the build when she go out on the balcony there wa no one there they be all stand near the entryway that build wa also a lucky one in that there be no murder there she jump she jump and do feel any pain in the heat of the moment a few day later i find out that she could stand up she have be injure somehow that how person in sumgait save their life their honor and their child any way they could where it wa possible the armenian fight back my father first cousin arman m life in block they find out by phone from one of the victim what wa go on in town the armenian in that build all call one another immediately and all of them arm themself with axe knife even with musket and go up to the roof they take their infant with them and their old woman who have be in bed for god know how many month they get them right out of their bed and take everyone upstair they hook electricity up to the trap door to the roof and wait ready to fight then they take the daughter of the school board director hostage she an azerbaijani who live in their build they call the school board director and tell her that if she do help them the armenian on the roof to escape alive and unharmed she never see her daughter again i sure of course that armenian would never lay a hand on a woman it wa just the only thing that could have save them at the time she call the polouse the armenian make a deal with the local polouse to go into town two armor personnel carrier and soldier be summon they surround the entryway and lead everyone down from the roof and off to the side from the armor personnel carrier wa a crowd that wa on it way to the build at that very moment into block that how they defend themself i hear that my neighbor roman and sasha gambarian resist they big strong guy their father wa kill and i hear that the brother put up a strong defense and lose their father but be able to save their mother one of the neighbor tell me that after it happen when they be look for the criminal on march to and detain everyone they suspect person hide person in my entryway maybe person who be injure or perhap dead the neighbor themself be afraid to go there and when they go with the soldier into my basement they be suppose to have find azerbaijani corpse i do know how many even if they have be wound and put down there after two day they would have die from los of blood or infection that basement wa fill with water i hear thi from the neighbor and later when i wa talk with the investigator the subject come up and they confirm it i know too that for several hour the basement wa use to store object steal from my apartment and my neighbor carry out my carpet along with the rest he steal it for himself pose a one of the criminal everyone wa take hi own share and the neighbor take hi too and carry it home and when we come back when everything seem to have calm down he return it say that it wa the only thing of our he have manage to save raya husband and father defend themself the trdatov defend themself and so do other armenian family to be sure there be azerbaijani victim although we never hear anything about them for some reason my government do want to say that the armenian be not just victim but that they defend the honor of their sister and mother too in the tv show pozitsiya viewpoint a military man an officer say that the armenian do virtually nothing to defend themself but that not important the truth will come out regardles so that the price we pay those three day for three day my courage my bravery and my humanity wa test it wa those three day and not the year and dozen of year we have live before them that show what we become what we grow up to be those three day show who wa who on that i will conclude my narrative on the sumgait tragedy it should be say that it not over yet the trial be still ahead of u and the punishment receive by those who so violate u who want to make u into nonhuman will depend on my position and on the work of the investigator the procuracy and literally of every person who lend hi hand to the investiga tion that the price we pay to live in armenium to not fear go out on the street at night to not be afraid to say we armenian and to not fear speak my native tongue october
