from subject re dr frankenstien some of ymy article wa cut off on the right margin but i will try and answer from what i can read in article kaveh kaveh smith write i have find jewish person very imagentative and creative jewish religion wa the foundation for christianity and islam in other word judaism ha father both religion now islam ha turn against it father i may say it be ironic that after communizem threat be almost go religion war be go to be on the raise i think the idea of believe on one god wa to unite all man kind how come both jew and islam which believe on the same god the god of ebrahim be kill each other is thi like dr frankenstien story how be you go to stop thi from happen how be you go to deal with so many muslim nuking them would distroy the whole world would god get mad since you have kill hi follower you believe on the same god same heaven and the same hell after all what be the peacefull way of end thi saga judaism do not father islam we have many of the same prophet but judaism ignore prophet later prophet include jesu christ who christian and muslim believe in and mohammed the idea of believe in one god should unite all people however note that christianity and islam reflect the fact that there be person with different view and the right of non-christian and non-muslim be state in each religion man kind need religion since it set up the rule and the regulation which keep the society in a healthy state a religion be mostly a set of rule which person have experience and know it work for the society the pray keep the sole healthy and meditate it god do not care for man kind pray but man kind hope that god will help him when he pray religion work mostly on the moral issue and try to put away the materialistic thing in the life but the religiou leader need to make a live through religion so they may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to make their live muslim have to pay percent of their income to the mullah i gues the rabie get hi cut too we be suppose to pay of my income after all necessity be pay please note that thi be on a personal basi if you be poor there be no need to pay quite the contrary thi money most often go to the poor in each in country and to the poor muslim around the world also thi money be not require in the human sense a muslim never knock at ymy door to ask for money and nobody make a list at the mosque to make sure you have pay and we surely do pa money basket around during my prayer service is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respect each other be good toward each other help one another respect the mother nature is in that heaven and hell be create on earth through the act that we take today is in it that within every man there be good and bad he could choose either one then he will see the outcome of hi choice how can we prevent man kind from go crazy over religion how can we stop another religiou kill field under poor god name what be ymy think do you think man kind would to come it sense before it be too late on the side do you think that mosis saw the god on mount sina why would god go to top of the mountain he create the earth he could have be anywhere why on top the mountain wa it because person think to see god you have to reach to the why god keep come back to middle east wa it because they create god through their imagination is that why jewish person be tell by god they be the choose one god presence be certainly on earth but since god be everywhere god may show sign of existence in other place a well we can not say for sure where god ha show sign of hi existence and where he ha not profit mohammad wa marry to khadijeh she wa a jewish she teach him how to trade she probably teach him about judaism quran be mostly copy right of taurah sp old testement do you think god write quran makeh wa a trade city before islam do you think it wa make to be the center of islamic world because mohammad want to expand hi trade busines is that why god ha put hi house in there the be not a copyright of the taurah muslim believe that the taurah the bible and the originally contain much the same message thu the many similiarity however the taurah and the bible have be into other language which ha change their mean over time a translation also reflect some of the personal view of the translator s the still exist in the same language that it wa reveal in arabic therefore we know that mankind ha not change it mean it be truly what wa reveal to mohammed at that time there be many scientific fact which be not discover by traditional scientific method until much later such a the development of the baby in the mother womb i think thi religiou stuff ha go too far all man kind be go to hurt from it if they do not wise up look at david koresh how that turn out i be afraid in the bigger scale the jew and the muslim will have the same end only god know for sure how it will turn out i hope it wo but if that happen it wa the will of god religion be need in the sense to keep person in harmony and keep them do good thing rather than plot each other distruction there be one earth one life and one god let all man kind be good toward each other god help u all peace please send thi mail to me again so i can read the rest of what you say and ye may god help u all steve
