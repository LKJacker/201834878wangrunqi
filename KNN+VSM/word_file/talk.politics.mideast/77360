from ronald bleier rbleier subject reflection on neier reflection on bosnium lord owen and the serb in early february lord owen make appearance in new york city on the donahue and charlie rose show on a couple of occasion on those show lord owen give away hi pro-serbian position when he make the point that much or most of the bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by serbian force have be control and occupy by serb before wwius it wa a if he be say that since the serb have previously occupy those territory and lose them during the hitler year they should be allow to reconquer them today i wa familiar with thi view because my father a yugoslav jew who escape to thi country during the war wa aid and find sympathy among the serb during those harrow year in recent month when the subject of serbian aggression wa mention my father would make the point that serb be kill by nazi and pro-nazi croatian force know a the ustasha my father be so pro-serbian that he dismiss report of serbian atrocity my father also excoriate new york time columnist anthony lewi because my father say anthony lewi be alway talk about the muslim update april after an uneasy truce in and around sbernica shell ha resume in nearby area by all side and the kill and the misery continue apace while the clinton administration dither it response in the day lead to the collapse of resistance at sbernica lord owen change hi tune previously he have oppose military intervention on the grind that it would endanger relief worker when serbian force begin to march on sbernica the threat to relief soldier go unmentioned while lord owen call for outside intervention to stop serbian aggression include the use of air strike the current disastrou situation can be see a a failure of the west and a failure of the vance-owen initiative which do nothing to halt the serb now that it too late to save muslim area that lord owen felt should be in a muslim state lord owen belatedly call for strong action clinton and bosnium in the summer of george kenney a senior state department official the undersecretary in charge of the yugoslav desk make news when he resign from the state department because of the bush administration refusal to take any action to halt serbian aggression a kenney saw it bush inaction wa largely due to the president unwillingnes to risk any political capital by get involve there apparently the same be true of the clinton administration clinton gife the impression that he care more than bush do about the terrible ongoing tragedy but the practical effect ha so far be the same according to the new york time the clinton administration do everything it could to suppres a mid-march report by it own expert which call for military action if necessary to protect safe haven for the muslim at one point senate majority leader george mitchell wa so incense that the report wa keep from congres that he call for an investigation instead of help the desperate bosnian clinton ha signal again and again that milosevic and the serb be free to do what they want in bosnium indeed clinton and the west have be signal that the serb should get on with the job and finish off the bosnian a quickly a possible while we turn the other way a key signal wa when clinton make it clear that he would not send in american military force on the grind on thi issue clinton ha make me wistful for bush bush and baker could not have do worse and might have be pressure to do better well before thi time life in bosnium might have be save and the destruction might have be curtail the nation the leave and the bosnian quandary typical of the leave inability to come to grip with the core issue involve in bosnium a clear aggressor destroy hundred of thousand of life be the editorial on the bosnian quandary in the nation in the end the editorial vote to do nothing even while notice the ghastly atrocity of the bosnian serb and that the greater and lesser power dither and fus and hang back before anything else happen the clinton administration ought to pay the million the united state owe the the editorial conclude in it most strike passage the editorial writer warn that those who be push president clinton to intervene on the side of the bosnian have better review foreign policy since world war ius the editorial argue for inaction on the basi that the bosnian serb be no worse than any number of client include the chilean the south african the greek fascist and other in a subsequent column for the nation christopher hitchen correctly call thi editorial contemptible william pfaff a european base journalist who write for the the new yorker and the lo angele time be among a group of liberal columnist like anthony lewi and leslie gelb who have clearly and consistently call for strong western and american intervention to stop the serb pfaff most recent column liberal opinion week be entitle international cowardice worsened bosnian tragedy he clarify the international failure which ha lead to present situation in one sentence having refuse to intervene to sanction the threat to minority right in newly independent croatium in june or to block or penalize the military aggression by serbium that immediately follow and the atrociou ethnic cleanse which follow that the united nation now contemplate deploy in bosnium military force on a scale which two year ago could have deter the horror yugoslavium ha since experience he go on to explain that plan now envisage call for a more daunt and open-ended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have be a year ago aryeh neier on the serb in hi watching right column in the the nation aryeh neier get to the heart of the motivation of the aggressor the prefer term for the serbian force who have be besiege and shell sarajevo for more than a year he explain that there be no military purpose that be serve by the destruction of it fabric and it person above all few of those align with the force attack sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuild they be not city person it be thi i believe aside from a desire to break the morale of bosnian and make them pres their government to accept peace at any price that explain the conduct of the siege of sarajevo i t be a loathe for all that be urban pluralist and cosmopolitan that ha make sarajevo the object for devastation historically most of the serbian population in bosnium and herzegovina ha be rural while muslim who be the civil servant and intelligentsium during the century of ottoman rule make up a disproportionate share of the urban population the destruction of sarajevo be not only an expression of hostility against thi city it be also an attack on the urban idea the demagogue who whip up the passion let loose by thi war exploit not only ethnic and religiou bigotry but also hatred for all that be cosmopolitan the light that neier shed on the issue help to clarify what be at stake the serb represent the know-nothing anti-secularist fundamentalist fascist force who be attack the urban cosmopolitan secular multi-cultural idea they be attack the rest of u just a hitler do one irony be that at the begin of the crisi over bosnium it wa for awhile maintain by the serb and their supporter that they be respond to a threat by the bosnian muslim to create a fundamentalist state neier ha show that it be the serb who be the great threat to secularism multi-culturalism diversity and democracy it the serb who be attack the democratic notion the democratic idea anthony lewi come close to the point when he ask why do respect for clinton presidency depend on hi act effectively against serbian aggression first of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the value we and my ally profes time but it not merely a betrayal of my value it because the serb be attack u by proxy just a hitler wa one argument for decisive action by the west that be hear in a different form be that war in the balkan be destablizing for europe we hear it a the bosnian be europe palestinian that be to say just a the palestinian refugee problem ha be the key to instability in the middle east just so will the hundred of thousand of yugoslav refugee of all ethnicity result in turmoil in europe for decade to come one of the lesson of the twentieth century be that even though the atlantic ocean divide u the america be ultimately tie to the destiny of europe if europe be destabilize the will inevitably be affect and draw into it problem a in a whirlpool sooner or later we will be draw into the maelstrom and a past history and pfaff have show it much better if we do so decisively quickly and on my term sincerely ronald bleier
