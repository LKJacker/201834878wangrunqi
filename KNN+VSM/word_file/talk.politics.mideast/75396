from stssdxb dorin baru subject re no land for peace no negotiatian hasan write ok i donot know why there be israeli voice against negotiation however i would gues that be because they refuse give back a land for those who have the right for it sound like wishful guess a for the arabian and palestinean voice that be against the current negotiation and the so-called peace proces they be not against peace per se but rather for their well-founded prediction that israel would not give an inch of the west bank and most probably the same for golan height back to the arab an month of negotiation in madrid and washington prove these prediction now many will jump on me say why be you blame israeli for no-result negotiation i would say why would the arab stall the negotiation what do they have to loose what do you mean how would you see the peace proces so you say palestinean do not negociate because of prediction how do you know that they be found if you do not test them at the table month do not prove anything but it alway the other side at fault right why i do not know why but if let say the palestinean some of them want all israel and these be know not to be accept term by israeli or maybe they palestinenan be not yet ready for statehood or maybe there be too much politic within the palestinean leadership too many fraction aso i be not say that one of these reason be indeed the real one but any of these could make arab stall the negotiation arab feel that the current negotiation be only for legitimize the current status-quo and for open the door of the arab market for israeli trade and orange that be simply unacceptable and would be revoke i like californium orange and the feel may get sharper at the table regard dorin
