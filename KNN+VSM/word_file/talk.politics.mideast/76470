from adam adam shostack subject re deir yassin in article get thee to a nunnery write hm write in article get thee to a nunnery write you say that there be no evidence that what motivate the irgun to attack dir yassin wa it strategic importance in fact begin who wa in charge of the irgun write that dir yassin wa attack for it military significance dir yassin wa merely a battle in the war of liberation person die but the thing wa never intend to be a masacre that thi hapenned be a tragedy of war not a crime of the irgun i agree with you harry however you must also concede then that arab terrorism be also a tragedy of war no one be force to blow up airplane terrorism be a choice make by person because they do not want to work for peace remember that the palestinian have no other effective target but civilian in order to further their cause there be lot of military target in israel there be lot of legitamate target in israel old lady child and civilian in general be not acceptable target if the only person you can kill be a civilian you hold ymy fire if that mean you ca kill anyone then you ca kill anyone claiming that civilain target be acceptable because they be easy kill be rediculou if irgun have to attack civilian target to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective i sure they would have do so did they make a policy of it i also do exclude irgun action against british soldier a terrorism did you mean excuse killing a soldier and kill a civilian be two very different act the british be show sign of favor a compromise with regard to palestine and the irgun and branch off group make a point to kill young british recruit so that mother and father back in britain would get angry at britain continue presence in palestine no they kill soldier so that the british government would leave the objective wa not to scare civilain but show that the cost of stay wa way too high in contrast a terrorist kill civilain to scare other civilain they use random violence against person to make a point that no one be safe until their demand be meet an analogy would be the irgun blow up harrod or downing sound like a form of terrorism to me and not much remove from arab terrorism that because you miss the essential point of arab terrorism which be to scare civilain away from israel by kill those who have something to do with israel it be to kill jew because they might be zionist it be to kill person who live in israel because of where they live the target be rarely soldier or other person who understand they might be attack in the line of duty but innocent civilian to underscore the message that no one who deal with israel be safe i reiterate again both side be screwy but i favor the underdog in thi case because i do think they be a bite screw oh you mean you favor the israeli outnumber to outgunned surround by hostile state only one of which ha sign a peace treaty in year you favor the jew person like leon klofhinger a cripple who wa throw off a boat because he wa jewish you support the right of the jewish person to live in peace why thank you for ymy support adam adam shostack adam if we have a budget big enough for drug and sexual favor we sure would waste them on member of congres john perry barlow
