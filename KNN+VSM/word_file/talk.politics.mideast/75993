delegate under the isga will be reserve by israel israeli will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd israel alone will have responsibility for security in all it aspect external internal and for the maintenance of public order the organ of the isga will be of an administrative-functional nature the exercise of power under the isga will be subject to cooperation and coordination with israel israel will negotiate delegation of power and responsibility in the area of administration justice personnel agriculture education busines tourism labor and social welfare local polouse local transportation and communication municipal affair and religiou affair the palestinian counterproposal of march the establishment of a palestinian interim self-governing authority pisga whose authority be vest by the palestinian person it pisga power can not be delegate by israel in the interim phase the israeli military government and civil admini tration will be abolish and the pisga will asume the power previou ly enjoy by israel there will be no limitation on it pisga power and responsibility except those which derive from it character a an interim arrangement by the time pisga be

peacekeeping force dispute with israel over self-governing arrangement will be settle by a committee compose of representative of the five permanent member of the un security council the secretary general of the un the pisga jordan egypt syrium and israel but perhap the bargain attitude behind these very different vision of the interim stage be wrong for two reason the present palestinian and israeli leadership be a moderate a be likely to exist for many year so the present opportunity may be the last for a significant period since these negotiation be not design to or even attempt to resolve the conflict attention to issue deal with a desire final statu be mi place and potentially destructive given thi how should proposal from either side be alter to temper their maximalist approach a state above how can israeli worry and desire for some interim control be address while provide for a very real interim palestinian self-governing entity tim april response by al moore basically the problem be that israel may remain or leave the occupy territory it can not do both it can not do neither so far isra continue to propose that they remain the palestinian propose that they leave why should either change their view it be worth point out that the only area of compromise accomodating both view seem to require a reduction in the israeli presence israel propose no such reduction and in fact may be say to not be negotiate tim there seem to be two perception that have to be address the first be that of israel where there be little trust for arab group so there be little support for israel give up tangible asset in exchange for piece of paper expectation hope etc the second be that of the arab where there be the demand that these tangible concession be make by israel without it receive anything tangible back given thi the gap between the two stance seem to be the need by israel of receive some tangible return for it expect concession by tangible be mean something that provide israel with comparable protection from the land it be to give up in some way ensure that the arab state and palestine will be accountable and hold actively not just diplomatically responsible for the uphold of all action on it territory by citizen or visitor in essence i do not believe that israel objection to palestinian statehood would be anywhere near a strong a they be now if israel wa assure that any new palestinian state would be commit to co-existing with israel and hold responsible for all attack on israel from it territory aside from some of the rather slant proposal above how could such guarantee be instill for example how could such guarantee control be add to the palestinian pisga proposal israel be hang on largely because it be scar stiff that the minute it let go gife land back to arab state no more buffer zone gife full autonomy to palestinian any all of the arab party could and would if not control somehow easily return to the traditional anti-israel position the question then be how to really ensure that that will not happen tim
