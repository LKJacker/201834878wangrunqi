from thornley david h thornley subject re jack morri in article maynard roger maynard write not at all i be talk about morri win with toronto last year you be about to launch into a fantasy about the red jay and how toronto would have do with viola on their team viola do play for toronto last year morri do the problem with ymy nihilistic approach roger be that it take all the sense out of the game by ymy line of reason if a guy hit into a double play with one out and the basis load there no point in say that that wa a bad thing to do if hi team win anyway or speculate on what might have happen if thing have go otherwise so the double play be merely an event that happen in the course of a game that wa eventually win or lose for unknown reason after all any speculation involf construct a fantasy about what would have happen but do roger do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead or be you will to consider empirical evidence team go to the post-season when they win more game than anybody else in their division if they do make the post-season they do win the series will you agree that win a division be a useful intermediate goal in ring-collecting if so you must agree that win game be a useful intermediate goal toward win the division and my disagreement come when we consider how to win game in ymy viewpoint a express win game happen for reason that can not be analyze while many of u be think thing like base runner be good out be bad and therefore walk be better than double play with the basis load you be think thing like it a team game so perhap the double play will cause some mysteriou team dynamic that will cause the team to win today the result be that it become impossible to say anything about individual player perhap atlantum would have win the series with me play leave field after all perhap in some way my knowledge and personality would have help the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it therefore i could be an extremely valuable player did dave winfield have anything to do with the jay victory probably but how do you know if you replace him with andre galarraga perhap the jay would have win perhap they would have lose perhap they would have defect to alpha centaurus bear in mind that the fly saucer would not have land in mid-season have winfield be dhing for toronto wa babe ruth a good player he play on some ws-winning team but do he have anything to do with their succes it be generally accept that ernie bank wa a good baseball player and jarvi brown and dan schatzeder be it seem to me that anybody who would deny thi need to provide the proof now we have observe thing about baseball over the year both empirically and by look at the rulebook it be necessary to score more run than one opponent to win the game so it would seem important to score run and to prevent one opponent from score run be score while a team be bat and an inning end after the third out so it would seem that make out be bad while hit home run be good player have tendency to hit or pitch at certain level and these be usually somewhat consistent from year to year we do use these statistic to predict winner and so do you to make some flat prediction barry bond will have a higher than gene larkin thi year the brave will finish ahead of the rocky in the stand the tiger will score more run than the royal but will also give up more i would be astonish if any of these turn out to be false and i suspect so would you a a matter of fact i be pretty sure i can predict all the division winner thi year give guess per division and thi be certainly better than random chance and almost statistically significant if you will admit that the rocky and mariner be unlikely to meet in the world series you must admit that there be some sort of way to measure likelihood however fuzzy it be impossible for all other thing to be equal so ymy fantasy be totally meaningles so how about real life person a rob a service station with two person in it use a automatic pistol get and be convict and sentence for three year person b with a similar criminal record rob a service station with two person in it use a revolver get and be convict since they use two different type of handgun be comparison totally meaningles say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still work my cat be alway test thi they do trust me to pay the gravity bill on time you have never drop a pencil at that exact time of the century before so all previou evidence be meaningles or would you be surprise if it fly out the window instead of hit the desk david thornley who ha no replica world series ring but do have ticket to the world series in the metrodome
