from tedward edward ted fischer subject re basis load walk gife red win in in article m mark singer write actually i think the large-scale sample size be part of the problem it seem to me that if we be to plot all the player in baseball in regard to ba v clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve the x-axi be the deviation in clutch hit v non-clutch the y-axi be the number of player certainly there would be some player on the extreme end of the bell right most definitely my supposition be that if we be to find the same player consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusion about those player a oppose to all baseball player thi may be the root of the confusion please consider the follow hypothetical with an open mind note that i be not yet say that it ha anything to do with the question at hand suppose we have a simplify lotto game you pick a number from and win if that number be draw suppose we have a large population of person who play thi game every week in the first year of the game approximately of the population will win or more time in the second year of the game of those winner will again be winner in the third year of the game of those who win or more time in each of the first two year will win again suppose i start with person in my population after three year i have person who have consistently in each of the last three year win or more the number of time expect do we expect them to be big winner in the fourth year of the game no because we know there be no skill involve nothing about these consistent winner can influence their chance of win but suppose we know whether or not there be a chance that skill might be involve perhap some of the person in my population be psychic or something how would we test thi hypothesi we can look for correlation in the population now most of the population will show zero correlation but my psychic should show a high positive correlation even if they be very good psychic they should still manage to win or more time most year net result a small positive correlation over the entire population thi probably bring u to the heart of the disagreement i be have with other on thi topic must any conclusion base on statistical history be able to be apply broadly throughout a datum base before it ha any validity is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysi to select component of the datum base well zero correlation be zero correlation you mention that sabo ha hit poorly in the clutch over the last year but if we look at the past we find that clutch pattern be just a likely to reverse a they be to remain consistent the length of the streak do seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year is there any reason to expect thi streak to be different from past streak now if it be true that of all three-year streak remain true to form then we might have something useful but then we would have zero correlation instead we have of all three-year streak remain true to form and of all three-year streak reverse you look at those number and say three year choke streak imply more likely to choke thi year but it would be equally valid to look at those number and say three year choke streak imply more likely to be clutch thi year since the probability be split each way i completely accept that reason again what if we be to find the same individual at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basi then we would have something useful and we would also have a positive correlation but for every individual that exhibit such a pattern and hold true there be another who exhibit such a pattern and then reverse cheer valentine
