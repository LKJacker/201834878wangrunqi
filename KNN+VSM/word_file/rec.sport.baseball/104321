from subject re brave pitching updatedir in article dave naehring write in article snichol sherrus nichol write every single piece of evidence we can find point to major league baseball be offense defense a run score be just a important a a run prevent thi certainly pas the common sense test for me but be there any statistical evidence to say what percent of defense be pitch and what percent be field i really like to know btw sherrus thank for the da datum i find it fascinate of course a run score be just a important a a run prevent just a a penny save be a penny earn enough with the clich my point be that if the brave starter be able to live up to their potential they wo need much offensive support i realize thi be a big if thi staff leaf the bosox in the dust there be no legitimate comparison two cy young winner and three other pitcher that most any team in the league would kill to have a their first or second starter it seem to me that when quality pitcher take the mound the other team score le run the team that score the most run win thi put the team with the better pitch at the advantage provide they can stop the oppose team from score run a low score game would clearly benefit the brave they should have many low score game due to their excellent pitch and below average hit on the flip side if you have a start lineup of great offensive player i would be argue that thi team would not need great pitcher they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent the name of the game be to win even ray knight know that you do thi by put more run up on the scoreboard all i try to say be that if you assemble the quality pitcher like the brave have the offense do need to be a strong sam dave sherrus nichol snichol
