from mjone mike jone subject re jack morri maynard roger maynard write it sure do and it all depend on the definition that you use for better your be base on what could have be and mine be base on what really happen well actually most of our be base on what really happen and your be base on some fantasy of how it happen but that ok i understand you have a hockey background stat like make rbi look good is it viola fault that boston have no offense is it because of morri that the blue jay have such a strong offense do tell me that morri ha thi magical ability to cause the offensive player to score more run thi be the perfect example of ymy problem you be isolate viola contribution from the rest of the team effort you can only do thi if you can say for sure what the team would have do without viola only then can you compare but you can not know how the team would have do without viola ymy analysi be fallaciou ok how about a straigh answer then here a very simele question to which i sure a fair number of u be very inter in the answer to please answer ye or no roger can a pitcher cause the offensive player on hi team to score more run al only please for anyone else follow along it be a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team win-los record be closely relate to the number of run the team score and the number the team allow it not a definite hard-and-fast function but there be definitely a correlation in fact a a rule of thumb if team a and b both score x run and team a allow y run for every run fewer than y that team b allow it will win another game so for instance if we look at the toronto blue jay we find that they score run and allow of which morri allow all other thing be equal if frank viola with hi era have replace jack morri for the inning morri throw plausible since viola throw for boston the red jay would have allow about fewer run or enough for more win now that do take into account that viola pitch half hi inning in fenway which be a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than skydome so um roger unles you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of run hi team score could you enlighten u to the fallacy in thi analysi clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that viola would necessarily have put up a if he have be on the jay last year but that be not the claim we look at what the actual performance be and evaluate viola a better than morri in the sense that have morri perform a viola do hi team would have be better off it take an open mind to really truly understand what be happen out here in the real world guy thi be true but not so open that ymy brain fall out mike jone aix high-end development mjone computer if you do open that exit hatch thi moment i shall zap straight off to ymy major datum bank and reprogram you with a very large ax got that zaphod beeblebrox
