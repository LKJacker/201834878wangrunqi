from mjone mike jone subject re how do a pitcher get a save mikef write in article geoffrey e dia write the subject line say it all what be the rule that qualify a pitcher a make a save imho thi be the most untrustworthy silly stat by today rule in all of baseball my understand be to qualify a a save a pitcher can not pitch more than three inning and the potential tie run must at least appear in the on-deck circle also the lead a pitcher enter with can not excede three run thi be a phenomenon know around work a ready-fire-aim i be astound at the number of time person post strong opinion about thing they not only do understand but publicly admit to not understand in fact there a plausible argument that save be a more rational stat than win for the record there be two way that a reliever can get a save he must finish the game and either have enter the game with the tie run on base at bat or on deck have pitch at least three inning effectively a pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game i believe that the official scorer must assert more of their authority in determine for instance a pitcher can come in in the ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have hi team come back in the next half inning and earn the win ha thi pitcher earn a win no way but thi be an argument that win be a dumb stat not save i guy could pitch five strong inning of middle relief and see hi teammate rally to tie the score assume he come in to start the fourth and leave after the eighth hi teammate hold the opposition scoreles in the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win the third pitcher earn the win and the middle reliever get no stat satisfaction thi again do support ymy claim about save at the begin of ymy post mike jone aix high-end development mjone conceptual integrity be the most important consideration in system design frederick p brook jr the mythical man-month
