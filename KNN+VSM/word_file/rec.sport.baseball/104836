from hhenderson subject re game length wa re brave update mzimmer michael zimmer write first a longer game in no way suggest more baseball to watch unles you include watch the gras grow a baseball i definitely do that why i do like go to see game play on artificial turf the lengthier game be so because of batter step out of the box pitcher take longer between pitch and excessive trip to the mound by manager and pitch coach and while it true that the gap between play can be interest thi be only true when they do become extra-long well ymy idea of interest differ from mine i think bat practice be interest for example and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it i think the delay tactic of batter pitcher catcher and manager be interest because they attempt to gain advantage through control of the flow and time of the game of course the umpire can and should intervene when these tactic get out of hand a ryan robbin ha point out there be rule that cover thi one of the more fascinate thing about baseball i think be it open-endednes with regard to time you never know if the game be go to zip right by and be over in le than two hour or if it go to go on until fmy in the morning likewise some game be action-packed and some game be slow and lazy that fine by me those folk who want constant action should watch the game on tv so they can channel surf and cater to their short attention span heather hhenderson
