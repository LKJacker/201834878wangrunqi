from fierkelab eric roush subject re young catcher since i wa the one responsible for these divergent thread of approx post go back to the brave could be better off if an injury happen i may a well inject a little more fuel to the flame back at the begin of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily olson wa still recover from hi late-season injury knee i believe and there be question a to whether he would be able to play before june and then berryhill wa ding up i wa look forward to thi because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position before last season he wa the brave defensive catcher prospect while brian deak wa the brave offensive catcher prospect beside olson and berryhill could hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and do walk enough to be useful but olson recover quickly berryhill recover and the brave go with the two vet i still say that if one of those two have be down at the start of the season he would have get hi job back there be a certain logic to keep olson and berryhill around after all ml catcher be in short supply and suffer from wear and tear there be team out there without one average ml catcher californium and seattle come to mind certainly try to move olson or berryhill through waiver would be unlikely to work plu you have to eat that salary which be huge but be tiddleywink either i think olson at about berryhill at but that only what i recall ye i think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in thi also what be it that of the player be eligible for arbitration only the that be on the roster the longest be eligible of course the system may change but the extent of that change be not yet know from a busines standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until first time go on the dl i be still disappoint that lopez be on the team i still prefer to think of myself a a fan when it come to the brave and the truth be that i rather see my best team on the field which imo include lopez of course today we play the cub hopefully we wo need him a for the conversation i imagine it go like thi remember they both be gm the follow be not mean to be read by the humor-impaired cox ok we send jone down hi field could be a little smoother beside blauser can hit ok and hi field be better than it use to be schuerholz well we have to send nieve down too deion just wo sign that baseball only contract we ca count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense beside gorman not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet once hatcher go and deion sign we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez that ought to give u some pitch depth in cox yep that be nice too bad deion wo sign ok i look for nieve when justice start have berry-berry er back problem again now what about klesko schuerholz well we still get to fork out another mil for bream if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera i keep dangle sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he do seem to be the same gm first jeffry for jose and now whiten for clark if he get rid of brian jordan then i have to believe that he and whitey herzog switch body at the winter meeting cox ok keep try on bream and i wait til the trade deadline for my platoon maybe i can get a few extra at-bat for cabrera while we wait try californium if snow start slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that do work then perhap sid knee could be persuade to act up there alway the dl mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha schuerholz what about caraballo cox well he not that much better than lemke maybe if he start in richmond he start walk more beside if he go to be arbitration-eligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he make the big buck schuerholz now let see that leaf lopez cox nooooo i get tum keep lopez sure i do think olson would recover thi quickly maybe i can talk caminitus into run into him again schuerholz nope lopez ha get tum go you know that he get million in arbitration may a well put it off that one extra year beside until olson show hi stuff a little bite i ca trade him beside berryhill a left-handed hitter you know how rare that be cox do you mean a left-handed whiffer pretty common if you ask me i mean he make pat border look good in the world series pat border schuerholz hey you the one who would write lopez into the lineup cox well you the one who go out and get me jeff reardon beside i think lopez would be use to my pitch staff stuff he get some time with them thi spring look pretty good come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate schuerholz yeah but which stiff whichever one we keep will be hurt by may cox ok ok you make ymy point keep them both surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest then i can call up lopez and then we can win game the pennant the world series i be up there with john mcgraw casey stengel earl weaver oh they laugh at me in toronto but have you ever have to deal with george bell i finally get my just reward mwa-ha-ha-ha schuerholz easy bobby have you be take those happy pill leave around by chuck tanner why you ever hire that guy anyhow cox do ask me ask ted eric roush fierkelab i be a marxist of the groucho sort grafittus pari tanstaafl although the internet come close
