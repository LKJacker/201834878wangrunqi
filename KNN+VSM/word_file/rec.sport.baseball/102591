opposite don drysdale normally drysdale remark i would be challenge hitter by be ready to throw at them i ca afford to with thi team though we have to get my own runner go we ca afford to let the astro beat u he then wink and say well maybe davi will get deck once the fact that glenn davi lead the team in homer with six be primarily why he would be deck but it should be understand that hi current pace would give him nine for the season the hit on thi team be a little better but the power be all double and triple still carl furillo be the main reason no astro home run be hit over the weekend a he throw two runner out try for inside-the-park homer for those unaware of the nastnes of the astro park they have a high gray wall all around the outfield ball must be hit into the seat to be home run the foul pole be foot from home plate but the alley be foot away with center field at foot it a if some three-year-old throw a tantrum and tell hi playmate i ca hit home run nobody will hit home run remark roy campanella the dodger steal five basis friday but the astro decide to revitalize the baltimore chop that have fail week before for tonight anyway davi jim wynn and jose cruz do not have to me with their swing accord to the manager after pole and willie well reach base vium the baltimore chop drysdale deck jose cruz with a pitch he respond with a two-run double but wynn play first for davi pop up and the astro do score any more in that inning they do score in the fourth to erase a deficit and the astro wind up win they threaten to do even better the next game a tommy john
