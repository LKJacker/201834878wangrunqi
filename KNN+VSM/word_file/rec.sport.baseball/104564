from eric eric smith subject re the philly deja vu previously i write yeah the philly play over their head almost the whole year but it all catch up to them in one streak i be a old a man and i wa a big philly fan at the time age september be still a painful thing to remember but i can tell you that the philly never lead the league by that year going by memory alone i believe their biggest lead wa game and they be ahead when the famou lose streak begin a streak during which it seem that they find just about every way to lose know to man anyway i think they rebound just before the end and win their last couple game and be still in the thing until the final day but finish tie with the giant one game out and do the dodger or somebody else finish two game back that ha to be one of the closest last minute scramble ever ok you guy stir up my childhood memory so i go and do some research on the final month or so of the season it turn out that my recollection be pretty darn accurate at least a far a the philly record go on september thi wa the top of the stand w l gb philadelphium cincinnatus st loui san francisco thi be a game-by-game description of the remainder of the philly season date score opponent lead pitcher start and houston bunning houston short houston bennett san francisco mahaffey baldschun win san francisco bunning san francisco short baldschun lo angele bennett lo angele wise lo angele mahaffey st loui bunning baldschun cardinal take over place from cincinnatus st loui short san francisco bennett san francisco mahaffey giant move into a tie for with st loui san francisco bunning cardinal back in sole possesion of place houston short houston bennett houston bunning lo angele wise schantz lo angele short baldschun lo angele bennett baldschun lo angele bunning red move back into tie for with cardinal well so far so good for the philly but now it all fall apart cincinnatus mahaffey red take sole possesion of place cincinnatus short cincinnatus bennett milwaukee bunning milwaukee short boozer card now back in giant in milwaukee mahaffey schantz milwaukee bunning phil lose game in day red take over cardinal back in st loui short cardinal take over place phil drop to st loui bennett red and cardinal now tie for st loui bunning cardinal take game lead over red cincinnatus short roebuck philly halt lose streak card lead red by game did not play card lose to met red tie for phil game back cincinnatus bunning card beat met take first by from red and philly whew what a finish and the final stand be w l gb st loui philadelphium cincinnatus san francisco now it do appear to me that philly pitcher bunning and short be really overuse at least by the four-man rotation standard of the day until well along into the lose streak at which time mauch wa probably desperate for a win at any cost because the philly substantial lead have evaporate the way they be use at that time may have make the problem worse although bunning have one of hi sharpest game of the year in the final day shutout of the red that cost the red a share of the pennant bunning pitch a complete game six-hitter strike out five and walk one it would be inetersting to see though how the total inning for the year for bunning and short stack up against the rest of the league also notice that the philly play every day from at least september through october while they do play substantially more game than the other team the other team each have a couple day off during that stretch eric smith eric eric cus
