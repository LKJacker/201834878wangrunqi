from ryan robbin subject re game length wa re brave update umpire be not require to call time out just because a player ask for time only in extreme case like dust in the pitcher or hitter eye should an umpire call time the batter ha second to get situate in the box and receive a pitch i against put a giant clock or any size clock for that matter up to count down second between pitch and the minute for warm-up but i think umpire should tell hitter to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever and instruct the pitcher to pitch the same go for pitcher umps should tell them to pitch or feint within second or a ball will be call that the way it should be ryan robbin penobscot hall university of maine
