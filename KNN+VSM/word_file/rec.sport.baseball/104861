from kubey ken kubey subject re why be barry bond not bat i like the clark-williams-bond order pitcher can only walk clark with out unlike last year william be get better pitch to hit with bond loom in the on-deck circle since matt ha a terrible bat eye thi help the giant a lot when bond get on base all by himself he can try to steal and then be drive in with a single by thompson manwaring or clayton if you bat bond before the other slugger then you do want him to run because a catch steal could take you out of a big inning also bond be le in need of protection behind him because he be such a good base stealer a walk be a potential double the only draw back be when clark and william be clog up the basis infront of bond and i think that a problem the giant will be glad to see especially if robby thompson get hot ken kubey kubey
