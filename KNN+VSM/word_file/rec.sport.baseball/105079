from m mark singer subject re basis load walk gife red win in in article tedward edward ted fischer write in article m mark singer write in article tedward edward ted fischer write for predict the future it ha be entirely meaningles at least if it ha mean we do know how to find it i do not say i could predict the future you most certainly do i really do want to get into a didso-didnot debate with you but thi be somewhat at the heart of my disagreement i do not say nor do i imply that i could predict the future you have infer that my comment mean thi and you have base ymy rebuttal of my comment on the fact that statistical study have demonstrate that there be no reasonable basi for predict future performance in regard to clutch hit sabo samuel sabo be clearly a better hitter than samuel yet you would pinch-hit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter right i call that predict the future that be ymy opinion that sabo be clearly a better hitter than samuel the above datum be for a period end last season last season samuel bat while sabo hit not park adjust thi season they be both hit below albeit sabo with more at bat i will agree that over hi career sabo ha be a better hitter than samuel but i will also remind you that samuel ha be a better hitter in certain situation than sabo i do not predict that sabo would choke nor that samuel would get a hit i express my opinion that have i be the red manager or even a red fan that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that situation than sabo if you be to have be the red manager at that time i assume you would have have some basi for let sabo hit rather than pinch hit samuel i sure some of that basi would have utilize prior performance you just would have use thi particular aspect of prior performance is thi not correct right i would have use aspect of prior performance which have be show to be consistent in the past overall performance split even match style all of these will give me some advantage if use properly ah properly ye i see even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gain by look at past clutch performance and in thi case everything else point to sabo please help me what exactly be everything else that point to sabo well ye you be aware of it existance you claim to be incapable of understand it though i suspect you be simply unwilling yet you rather forcefully state the opposite you do seem to think the work be worth read yet you obviously feel the topic be important i say thi be insult i must say i wa not aware of the publication can you email me the information regard it availability and i gues i must apologize to all of those who have do extensive study on say supply side economic i do mean to insult you but i never do believe you be on the right path i sorry for my contrary i also regret that i do have the ability to prove that you be wrong but you be i believe that by season end that chri sabo bat average in clutch situation will be significantly lower than hi bat average in non-clutch situation i ca prove that it will happen so i gues we just have to wait and see is thi simply a prediction for chri sabo for thi year or be thi a prediction for all batter who have over the past few year hit xxx amount worse in the clutch than overall it be what it say it be if you mean the first then a you say we just have to wait and see but the second be a much stronger statement in fact it suggest a rule we can then test thi rule on past datum to see if it work for recent year i think you will agree that if the rule do work last year or the year before that it be unlikely to do any better thi year right the second be ymy statement not mine i not go to get into case analysi sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from and then hit poorly in a well you can also find those who hit poorly from and then hit well in well actually i have yet but i not finish look that be i have yet find someone who hit significantly below hi overall bat average in clutch situation for the year and then reverse that relationship in gambler fallacy unles there be reason to expect consistency a run prove nothing can you give u a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next i see a detail study of why i expect it to correlate nope sorry but if you be interest in a reason why i expect chri sabo ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could if you be interest in a reason why i expect joe carter ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could but you not interest in that because you think that those conclusion could only be valid if they could be extrapolate over the entire baseball population and they ca be the stupid wa in reference to a statement which wa stupid and i do see how you can deny it a for total idiot ye if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you be wrong i would say the term fit nicely the problem here be that i do believe you i accept ymy work i believe that try to predict future clutch performance base on prior clutch history be meaningles no better than a coin tos i actually do accept ymy work a it happen i also have an opinion that in certain situation for certain player a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in project future player performance for that player and chri sabo be one such player so tell me do the term fit or do you have an open mind well since i defer to ymy statistical wisdom i think i must have an open mind now we have to pose the same question to you the beastmaster mark singer m
