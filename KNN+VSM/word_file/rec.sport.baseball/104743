from rstimet robert and stimet subject re rule book trivium in article ryan robbin write if i be the manager i argue that the runner wa out of the base line since he wa to the leave of the first base line if the ump do budge which they wo they nev er admit when they be wrong i file a protest with the league rule k state it be interference by a batter or runner when in run the last half of the distance from home base to first base he run outside the three-foot line or inside to the leave of the foul line and in the umpire judgment interfere with the field er take the throw at first base the key word in the rule be and a runner be out just for run out of the baseline he out for interfere with the field of the ball or throw or field of the throw to first because the catcher opt to throw the ball over the batter-runner head there no inter ference so what be ymy definition of interfere with the fielder take the throw the rule book certainly do have a definiton or clarification so it possible to interpret the rule a say that if the catcher ha to alter hi throw to avoid hit the batter-runner then again we have interference you know it seem that there be no way to apply thi rule justly if the catcher or the pitcher say rob dibble for example throw toward first and hit the runner run inside the baseline the fielder take the chance of be eject therefore he probably would throw around the runner or ymy scenario above him you should note that in my american legion league which use mlb rule we interpret the rule to say in thi very circumstance there is interference per rule rstimet
