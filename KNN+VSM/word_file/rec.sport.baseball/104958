from m mark singer subject re basis load walk gife red win in in article tedward edward ted fischer write in article m mark singer write sigh here we go again actually several scdn state that there be no definable skill that would make a hitter more likely to perform better in clutch situation v non-clutch situation however one might choose to define clutch right can you define such a skill must i if i be to say that bat average be a predictor that can be use to judge which of two hitter be more likely to get a hit on a particular plate appearance be that only valid if i can define the skill in hit a baseball that all i say except i use the smaller sample of bat average in clutch situation and elsewhere on thi thread sherrus nichol repeat her position that bat average in clutch situation be a meaningles statistic for predict the future it ha be entirely meaningles at least if it ha mean we do know how to find it i do not say i could predict the future i suggest that the statistic be not necessarily meaningles here the datum for thi situation non-clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo samuel if you be to have be the red manager at that time i assume you would have have some basi for let sabo hit rather than pinch hit samuel i sure some of that basi would have utilize prior performance you just would have use thi particular aspect of prior performance is thi not correct i try to avoid be insult but it difficult when you so cavalierly dismis hundred of hour of work with an i do pretend to understand but nobody is denying that there be person who have hit well in the clutch in the past but i challenge you to find a method to predict who will hit well in the clutch in the future which after all be what you be claim you can do since one more time i do not claim to be able to predict the future i say that i accept the above datum a an indication that samuel would have have a better chance for succes in that situation than sabo and i be not dismiss ymy work i state my opinion you be say that ymy work render any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion be some kind of insult to ymy work fine we have plenty of datum obviously my preconceive bias must be color my work since you know clutch hit be a well-defined and consistent skill all of my failure not-withstanding so i challenge you to prove it i guarantee you that if you can prove the existance of some form of clutch ability you will have plenty of happy sdcn dance around you i do not say that clutch-hitting be well define i say that the datum be significant to me i do not say that it be a consistent skill i have say that it be an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstance but you be go to win any support by merely state a position and claim be stupid so i must be right and big sigh i have not not not not not not not ever call you or anyone else on stupid it be nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceive bias yeah hindsight be alway do that make you bright thi be a stupid argument and you know it ah i know we could get to the name call and there that word you like so much a suggestion take datum from and attempt to come up with some method that predict who hit well in the clutch in if that work we can then attempt to apply it to and beyond wait a minute i think i first have to define clutch hit do i or do i you have make strong statement now back them up or be prove a total idiot i make two statement in my post i be not convince of ymy conclusion regard clutch hit i would have hit for sabo a for many of u make a number of write statement through thi medium about what we think will happen in baseball i not shy about it i make the statement again i believe that by season end that chri sabo bat average in clutch situation will be significantly lower than hi bat average in non-clutch situation i ca prove that it will happen so i gues we just have to wait and see here another one for you in joe carter bat average in clutch situation wa significantly below hi bat average in non-clutch situation each year i presume you think thi be random non-clutch ab h clutch ab h so what could we expect in from mr carter well hi composite ba through wa through wa through wa so i think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of bat average he can produce in he hit not surprise huh also in non-clutch ab h clutch ab h no thi do prove any overall statistical trend that can be use to predict future performance acros the breadth of major league ballplayer it just make me think that in joe carter bat average in the clutch be not go to be a high a hi ba in non-clutch situation a for above i have plenty of company john dewan of stat inc be the editor of the scouting report wherein the statistic regard clutch hit be compile report and reference in the text bill jame make numerou reference to a player ability to hit well in the clutch i be not say that i can predict the future any more than they be you and other be say that ymy work render their statement and mine meaningles i do accept that which in ymy word prove that i be a total idiot stupid total idiot my my such hostility the beastmaster mark singer m
