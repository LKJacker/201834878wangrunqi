from mjone mike jone subject re so far so good the red sox wizard write i have post two new post on the net since i discover how to use it and both time i receive redicule for predict the red sox a high a third in the al east id like to hear why it be person dont think the sox can be a high a third thi year here be some of my observation well have you be a bite le exuberant in both the tone and substance of ymy prediction the response would probably have be a bite more measure be that a it may roger and frank be in vintage form and the sox be rresponding to them clemen be alway in thi form and viola be really perform beyond what might reasonably have be expect how do you know that the sox be respond to them and not to al bumbry hobson or my most likely suspect new hit coach mike easler i certainly be more likely to give easler credit for mo vaughhn hot start than clemen or viola greenwell be hit a he do before hi injury thi wa the optimistic scenario but not unreasonably so he ha show much power yet though dawson be provide the leadership and some hit they need from him how can you tell that dawson be provide the leadership perhap it calderon perhap it clemen and viola maybe hobson be finally show those person skill he wa suppose to have when they hire him or maybe it all a myth and dawson ha be hit reasonably well but not a well a greenwell vaughn cooper or fletcher russell be finish well in three game why do we look at thi one again in say july fletcher be hit well a a leadoff hitter a bite better than could reasonably have be expect but do forget that zupcic look like wade bogg lite for about ab last year beware of small sample size still if fletcher hit a well a he do last year he be a great improvement over any sox leadoff hitter from last year be aware that hi career number seem to indicate that he put up good number a long a he do have to make more than ab or so in a year cooper be hit well i think he be better then bogg in the field and just a good at the plate ummm sorry no i can buy the in the field part and i think he be better at the plate than the bogg but in general cooper while he be a pretty good hitter could carry bogg jockstrap with a little luck he could be the fourth or fifth best in the al martinez bogg ventura and palmer will all be better if the sox pitch like last year they have a better pitchiong staff now and hit like they be so far they coiuld run away with thee division but since i think that their hit and pitch may not be up to the challenge of run away with the division i think that they win be over and at least third if not second or first see here be where you make that quick leave turn off into the aether be plausible third be not unlikely but phrase like could run away with the division be likely to get you a visit from the man in the white coat it not really clear that their staff be better than last year if russell do well darwin do go on the dl and hesketh do pitch just barely well enough to avoid lose hi spot in the rotation they could be better on the other hand if hesketh pitch miserably and they too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up conroy or somebody fossa continue to pitch dismally but they keep give him inning becasue he a lefty and russell explode they could be pretty bad mike jone aix high-end development mjone god be a comedian play to an audience that be afraid to laugh mark twain
