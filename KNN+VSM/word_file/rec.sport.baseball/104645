from maynard roger maynard subject re jack morri in david robert walker write we can not isolate completely roger but we can make a pretty good estimate i wo claim to split hair and say that we can really measure who wa better robby alomar or carlo baerga last year the difference be too close to call but larkin and lee clemen and morri the difference be too great there in ymy measure of the game why should a team that ha just win it all ever replace a single player since they be now clearly best how can they do better yet every team can alway find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team they can alway find a player a little better than one they already have btw by my definition the best player be the one who do the most thing to help hi team win i will allow that thi could vary depend on who else be on the team by have aptitude one team need more than other well then give ymy definition of best be it not conceivable that alfredo griffin could bring something to a team that that team need to win while larkin might not have that something the team need would griffin then be better than larkin baseball be a team game but it be make of individual talent it be absurd to judge the succes or failure of an individual by the succes or failure of hi teammate whom he do not choose at least in most case morri win last year because he play on a team with joe carter robby alomar tom henke juan guzman john olerud et al clemen lose because he wa surround by such lesser performer a herm winninham lui rivera and jeff reardon to define the quality of the team a a sum of it component a i do albeit imperfectly be a lesser error than define the quality of an individual a the mean quality of the team a my read of ymy argument suggest you do no i be not try to define the quality of an individual at least not for the purpose of rank them toronto win with olerud they might have win with fielder they might not have win with thoma detroit might have win with thoma chicago might have win with fielder you ca rank these individual you can only look at who might contribute more to the team effort which be win the ws thoma could not have contribute to that goal any more than olerud so i can not say that olerud be le of a player cordially a alway maynard so many moron rm and so little time
