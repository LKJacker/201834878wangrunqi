from mse evenchick subject re dave kingman for the hall of fame in article steve tomassi write hi baseball fan so what do you say do you think he deserve it i mean heck if dave winfield ho-hum be seriously be consider for it a be lee smith ha then why do we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evan yeah yeah after the hall of fame take in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon i be try to think how to respond to thi without involve personal feel or perception and i can not without have stat to back up my point however i think you approach thi the wrong way i believe all of the person mention here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman do i feel they be all much better player i be not say i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more imho dave kingman definately not they guy only have a couple of year be he could hit with atleast a respectable averag the rest of hi career i do not think he wa very fear by pitcher i also do not think he do a lot for the game i mean really i be a met fan he wa a met for part of hi career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame dave winfield i think so he be fear by pitcher he ha have several season where he hit for a respectable average and hi production number be in my opinion without stat better than kingman probably by quite a bite i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not a much a some other person but none the le a leader i think he ha make substantial contribution to the game of baseball and to society example of thi be some of the charitable thing he ha do i know some of thi from when he wa with the yankee i think he the type of player that kid can look up to and while thi be definately not the only criterium for the hall of fame i think it deserve some consideration lee smith maybe i would have to see hi stat again but he definately would deserve to go before the like of kingman darrell evan no eddie murray maybe he ha have a very good career he be a leader although a silent one he be a good role model are the stat good enough i be not sure but i would once again believe they be much better than kingman both the average a well a the power number but not a good a winfield just think eddie do not have a much publicity for most of hi great year jeff reardon my gues be no but it kind of depend on hi number off the top of my head i would take lee smith first well in any case i be sick and tire mostly sick of everybody give hall of fame consideration to player that be by today standard marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount do belong there they both shortstop that just hang around for a long time big deal well i strongly disagree here both of these guy deserve it for sure i talk about leadership above both of these guy be leader and have be instumental in lead their team to the post season robin do have very good offensive number both average and power and ozzie ha okay number offensively the difference with ozzie be that if you give him a home run for every run he save by make an incredible play at shortstop he would have shatter aaron home run mark by now how many of those great play save game how many of those great play motivate hi team to rally and win a game while i believe both of these guy have number baseball be about more than number or at least win at baseball be about more than number both of these guy be prove star and belong in the hall of fame a do george brett who also belong in thi clas of player let be a little more selective huh stop hand out these honor so liberally save them for the guy who really deserve it face it if something be do there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individual believe that steve garvey or jack morri be potential candidate the absurdity be apparent gee can these guy even compare to the more likely future hall of famer like kirby puckett or nolan ryan steve garvey i be not sure probably not but i gues i could see someone make a case for him jack morri once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up hi name kirby puckett probably the only reason i do not say definately be he still ha time leave in hi career if he continue do what he ha be then my probably will turn into a definately nolan ryan is there really any doubt i think i hear something about him have some record maybe they be not all good i do know i do not hear any of them just the number he ha the number he ha the contribution to the game and community and he be a great role model i would not say that he be the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of hi accomplishment no-hitter strikeout respectable number even with some weaker team you can go on and on i really hope he get all the possible vote so in sum up i have group those that belong those that probably do but i be not sure and those that i lean toward say do belong at least not without my see stat and possibly hear reason why they should go ye winfield yount brett not in ymy mail o smith puckett and ryan maybe murray and l smith no reardon garvey morri evan and definately kingman a i say i do not have the stat around so i do not have number to back thi up these be entirely my opinion base on my perception mike q steve
