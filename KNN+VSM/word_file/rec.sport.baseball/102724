from mebonar mscidave subject re young catcher m mark singer say most catcher need to be solid defensively player to help their club in the big those be the argument against lopez for the brave for thi year now the brave have two catcher who have demonstrate solid ability to call game to work with the pitcher to throw out runner thi be the crux of the argument to me at least both the sdcn and the non-sdcn camp seem to agree on the fact that a catcher defense be basically nonmeasurable at present you can talk about how important call a game be or frame the pitch or block ball in the dirt but there be little or no way to tell exactly how variou catcher rank in defense looking at lopez specifically be there any reason to suspect that he be a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the brave or the medium ha label him a bad defensive catcher a far a i can tell he do have any particular problem in hi mechanic such a sasser he might be a little rough around the edge in block the ball or frame the pitch to get a good call but all he need to clear that up be play and practice time i ca see how repetition at aaa be any better then rep in the major all we leave with be the call the game aspect olsen and berryhill at alway give credit for call good game and help the pitchering staff but thi be a reputation that be give to almost all veteran catcher how be catch at aaa go to help lopez learn the major league pitch staff the only way any catcher be go to learn tom glavine pitch be to catch tom glavine similarly i would be supprised if the pitcher claim to prefer pitch to olsen over pitch to lopez because they be use to pitch to olsen but give time they will say they be comfortable with lopez now since lopez ca learn how to handle the major league pitcher while he in aaa and since he do have any glare problem in hi mechanic what be he go to learn in aaa that he ca learn just a well while in the major dave dave bonar mebonar
