from tedward edward ted fischer subject re jack morri in article cmk charle m kozierok write the only really valid retort to valentine be be the red sox try to get morri too oh sure they say viola wa their first choice afterward but what should we have expect they would say lou want morri all along the idiot giving the man million to play with be like give a five year old a load uzi with the safety off the only question be how many shoot he will get off before somebody be wise enough to take it away and do tell me boston will win thi year they wo even be in the top in the division more like if thi be true it wo be for lack of contribution by viola so who care i do see why person expect boston to finish sixth the bottom fmy team last year be essentially tie boston in seventh place have win the yankee and indian tie for fourth place have win now i should think it be obviou that the red sox improve more than the indian or tiger basically the red sox be stronger thi year at dh ss lf and rf they have healthier start pitcher so far at least and better reliever i see no reason why they should win game meanwhile the indian be in shamble and the tiger still have no pitch they will win some blowout but they will lose an awful lot of game too maybe the sox will play poorly win game and finish fifth but i think third or fourth place be more likely cheer valentine
