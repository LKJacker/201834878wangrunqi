from sepinwal alan sepinwall subject re jewish baseball player in article m mark singer write polish and jewish be not mutually exclusive i do mean to offend or anything i just quote stanky himself on the subject i remember one time last year he wa be interview by espn and the interviewer ca remember who ask stanky if he wa jewish because he the interviewer wa jewish and want to see more jewish ballplayer to which stanky reply i polish not jewish so maybe that wa the most pc thing for stanky to say and maybe i wa a little naive when i post it i think we should just devote thi subject to find actual jewish ballplayer i myself be jewish and the only one i ever know until now be koufax greenberg and blomberg alan
