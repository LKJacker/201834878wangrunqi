from rdetweil richard detweiler subject re espn and expansion in article donnie trump write i wa watch peter gammon on espn last night and he get me a little confuse while talk about expansion he start mention person who might benefit from the fringe player they be face mcgriff hit home run sheffield get rbi and glavine win game thi wa of course all in reference to what happen the other time that baseball ha expand early late late what really confuse me though wa the mention of al player who would do well next year specifically roger clemen win game and the like of mcgwire and gonzalez hit home run my question be how in the hell will the help the al the last time i look there wa a lot of talent jump league did i mi something denni cleary dfcleary i wonder the same thing when he first mention it i think he wa just make a mistake but then he say it over and over and then in the example from other year he give stat for player from both league even when only one league expand so since stat never lie i gues there be an effect on both league because the expansion draft take talent from both league equally make every team in both league dilute their major league talent by call up player that normally they would not have have there not be expansion make sense
