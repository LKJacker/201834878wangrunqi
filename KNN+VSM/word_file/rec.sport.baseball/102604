from m mark singer subject re young catcher in article genetic david m tate write m mark singer say i mean that one should not let the exception make the rule it not an exception good player come up young most player who come up young will be good thi ha alway be the rule are most player who come up young alway good when they young or later worse it not a shift thi be the way it ha alway be several detail study of thi have be do and they all show that player be come up any younger or older than in the past and they be play any more or le in the minor than they use to the only thing that shift be my memory of the good old day damn i wa afraid you would say that but all after the fact which make it not applicable to the current discussion which be about how you decide whether to play the rookie who ha establish himself in the major over the mediocre veteran the padre play santiago that year because they clearly have nobody else worth play well perhap if the brave have no one else worth play thi year it would be lopez in there but they do have other worth play at least in their opinion and i happen to agree both of these young man be highly tout defensive catcher expect to be among the best ever in baseball not by consensu that may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment but i find that the sdcn consensu when one exist be right far more often than the medium consensu or the opinion of baseball person affiliate with mlb i can believe that i a newbie here so i take ymy word but alomar be a fine defensive catcher which wa my statement above that be a solid reason for bring him up at a tender age a long a they feel he can also hit a bite lopez do not have such a consensu about hi defensive prowes and imho that be enough to give him that dread season i do know who know i suppose the same person or similar who know he will be better than some other catcher these be of course just differ opinion i read that hi arm be not that strong i suppose somewhere there be some measurement of sb ratio and that he be still learn to call a game that latter skill may be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of hi performance but it be a tangible skill i disagree in that i do think it be a tangible skill any more than leadership be i do deny that it be a real skill and that some catcher may be much better than other at it but i really do see any way that we could ever know who they be nichol law of catcher defense be eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessment of catcher very seriously sorry new do know nichol law do believe in catcher era but i be interest in pitcher era with different catcher any info on that absolutely the evidence be pile up year after year the only other alternative be that the brave really do know that their young player be on average better than their current starter i not rule out that kind of gros incompetence but i think the salary-schedule explanation be more charitable in other word we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial i presume we feel thi way about other franchise than atlantum no consider we know that the brave be about the strongest team in baseball right now even with olson and lemke and nixon and bream in the lineup they have a good a chance of repeat a champ thi year a any team ever ha it actually make some sense to say rather than make my team marginally better thi year by bring up the young stud and dump the elderly let go ahead and compete thi year with what we have and then bring up the stud only a we have to so that we still have them under reserve three year from now and beyond when the current team will be collect pension is it fair to the young player no do it make organizational sense i think it do well if it do make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decision i mean please do tell me how to run my busines especially when i be successful c i could make it or win if you let me bring up lopez s listen bobby i like to but the way i see it if he hit the big club thi year we be pay mega-arbitration buck down the road in a couple of year and there no way i want to do that and continue with we can win without him and then keep win next year with him how that i sure you could be right you could also be smoke some illegal substance hey that a joke do get offend please hey i love to be wrong about thi if you think it unlikely i love to know why do cite anybody innate ethical rectitude though unles you know them personally well i ca cite anyone ethical rectitude because i do know what it mean but again if it make organizational sense then so be it baseball be a busines and if there be a solid busines reason for keep lopez on the farm then that what the brave should do i happen to believe that it a baseball decision while you from ymy armchair may disagee i do i think there be a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they make i predict it among large guffaw from several at the start of spring train i think it be a very normal decision to have make it be certainly more reversible than to have start lopez in the big and have release one of their catcher sure it may be conservative it may also be logical i do know what ethic have to do with it seem like pretty good common sense to me the beastmaster mark singer m
