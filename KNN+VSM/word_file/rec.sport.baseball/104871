from gspira greg spira subject re jack morri maynard roger maynard write we have no way of know because we can not separate morri contribu tion from the rest of the team there be only one way of determin ing best in baseball and that be by look at the scoreboard at the end of the game each game determine which team be the best that day at the end of the season the team that wa the best the most often be the best in the division the playoff determine the best of the best but the point be that the only decision make pro ce use to determine the best be the score of the game and it re late to the team not the individual player there be no method inherent in baseball of compare individual performance and that be how it should be because after all baseball be a team game and you know what there be no such method inherent in real life either so i would assume you would endorse the notion that we can not state with any level of objectivity that mother theresa ha accomplish more good in thi world than joseph stalin after all life on earth be a team effort if you want to select a group of statistic and claim that clemen ha do better with those statistic a a criterium then fine but you have to be able to prove that those statistic measure the individual contribution to win the ws because that be the only measure of best that ha any mean in the context of base ball so until you can prove that clemen contribute to a ws cham pionship more than morri ymy evaluation of clemen be totally sub jective and be mere opinion i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon have you try glass i find them quite useful after all there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mound of evidence we present it too bad you feel it necessary to close ymy mind and eye to knowledge you live a poorer life a a result of that choice heck i wager that you could predict a ws winner with greater accuracy than jeanne dixon and you know why because i have full confidence that despite ymy protestation to the contrary you be quite capable of use the knowledge we can come up with through statistical method to boost ymy knowledge level you do have to be rude have you try call a kettle black for you to say that mean that you have either miss the entire point of my argument or you yourself have commit a fallacy ignoratio elenchi i be not say that morri be better than clemen because he ha more ring although i have tongue in cheek claim that in the past i be say that it be impossible to isolate an individual performance from that of hi team for the purpose of compare that individual performance with another individual per formance in other word in ymy world you can not objectively state that jack morri wa more important to the blue jay than al leiter last year in ymy world that may indeed be true fortunately in the world the rest of u occupy it not i hope you never serve on a jury roger i think the rest of the jury would have to kill you there no way i can objectively judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty you see there be billion other person on thi planet we have no way of know whether the defendant would have commit the crime if it wa for all the other person on the planet we have no way of know how the defendant would have act have he be on a different planet because live on thi planet be a team effort and no individual committ a crime totally isolate from hi society he be a part of that society that be case anything i have to say on hi culpability would be absolute subjectivity so i refuse to vote greg
