from genetic david m tate subject re young catcher m mark singer say we know that very very few player at thi age make much of an impact in the big especially when they have even play aaa ball ye but thi be irrelevant you talk about average when we have lot of information about thi player in particular to base my decision on i might a well say we know that very very few person be more than foot tall so chance be that manute bol be really only foot no maybe i need to improve my write skill lopez who be very ordinary defensively be not likely to hit so well at age have not play at aaa level that it be probably not a good idea to rush him into the brave lineup in why be lopez likely to hit that well he hit that well last year after adjust hi stat for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill do by a lot a for rush if there really be a qualitative difference between the minor and the major that require a period of adjustment and i do believe there be then would you rather waste lopez old good season than hi old very good season or hi excellent season the sooner you get him acclimate the more of hi prime you get to use lopez wa hit over ab when he wa cut from spring train what do he have to do to earn a chance maybe not a full time job but at least a couple start and a few ab for him to prove hi worth gee i do know ab sound pretty good to me about a good a ymy reason that the kid should play a back-up role rather than start every day at aaa talk about me a a gm the point wa not that ab be a significant sample but rather that he have do anything in spring train to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether hi minor league number be for real or to send him down until he get warm up ok most player be not ready for the big at age most player be never ready for the big what do thi have to do with javy lopez most player benefit rather than be stagnant or hurt by play at aaa see above most catcher need to be solid defensively player to help their club in the big those be the argument against lopez for the brave for thi year but i could apply the same reason to frank thoma or barry bond most player be that good so they probably wo be that good thi year either now the brave have two catcher who have demonstrate solid ability to call game to work with the pitcher to throw out runner and demonstrate inability to hit their way out of a soap bubble not superstar mind you but solid experience veteran not superstar not star not even good player maybe average if we be charitable the brave have a very solid lineup with two big bat in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hit shortstop ummm justice be a very fine hitter pendleton might have another big year in hi bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell gant be a big question mark the platoon be decent not excellent and ha rotten obp or slg depend on who in blauser be a very valuable bat for a shortstop the center field platoon will probably hit however good lopez bat might be give the above it wo be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability wan na bet the difference between lopez bat and could be or run over the course of the season given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play i take the latter every time the kid will improve play at aaa just like keith mitchell do i be just so surprise i have to spell all of thi out my goodnes do you believe the other poster who think lopez be be hold down because of hi future earn potential that wa me and you so far ymy only counter-proposal be that they really do understand how good lopez be or overvalue experience or some combination of the two i think my interpretation wa more flatter to the organization are they idiot who have build thi ballclub well-argued but inflammatory reply delete david m tate i do not know what it be about you that close pose a and open only something in me understand e e can the pocket of ymy glove be deeper than pete rose dy cumming nobody not even tim raine ha such soft hand
