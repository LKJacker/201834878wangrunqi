from king jonathan king subject team a organism stat or stat wa re jack morri note i not post thi a part of an argument with roger meynard but a an independent sort of thread i do actually quote some thing that roger meynard write but it might be better to think of thi a sample hi post in the hip-hop sense because it fit in with what i want to say maynard roger maynard write but the point be that the only decision make pro ce use to determine the best be the score of the game and it re late to the team not the individual player there be no method inherent in baseball of compare individual performance and that be how it should be because after all baseball be a team game there an interest parallel between thi way of view a baseball team and some person conception of a biological organism in the biology context we would very likely read fitnes for the score of the game and organism for team how we interpret player be trickier but either organ or gene might seem reasonable choice depend on what point we be try to make a gene interpretation actually might be really interest in thi case but that would be a different and probably longer post if however we take the organ view then my knowledge of biology should make u pause before we start say thing like specie x be more fit than specie y because of a better organ z given what we know about the interdependence of organ we would often be suspiciou of such claim but note that thi type of argument be quite often make when you map specie x onto and organ z onto on the other hand some statement of thi kind do seem more reasonable than other a far a we can test them above might be more reasonable than assume no gros pathology particularly if specie y be a primate even when you make such statement you should be concern with the function of the whole organism and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one specie and a second organ in another not to mention the possibility that no organ be particularly crucial in some third specie however if we be non-vitalist with any kind of reductionsit streak we will want to say that an organism be not some completely magical unanalyzable whole but an intrigue proces make up of variou subprocess that interact in way that be potentially observable some of these process might be localize to particular organ while other may be distribute acros multiple organ in a way thi be just like a baseball team except that i think it be pretty clear that the process and interaction involve in baseball be much simpler and le numerou than in most organism to say that one player be better than another be to be able to say ab solutely that player a team would have play better with player b in their lineup sheer speculation impossible to ascertain one thing that be quite difficult about baseball be that perfectly control experiment be sometime very tough to do but of course thi ha never stop researcher from do the best they can and sometime derive very powerful conclusion even in the absence of certainty most of thi go far beyond sheer speculation but even sheer speculation can motivate further interest research if you want to select a group of statistic and claim that clemen ha do better than another pitcher with those statistic a a criterium then fine in thi case we see the word statistic mean summary of observe event where the event themself can be view a the output of some proces and possibly input for other process thu if we have any valid notion of how the process be put together into the function organism datum in the form of statistic might give u a basi to test particular hypothesis but you have to be able to prove that those statistic measure the individual contribution to win the ws because that be the only measure of best that ha any mean in the context of baseball thi statement bring u back to the concept of fitnes again fitnes be define in term of both an organism and it environment you might be fit in one situation and not another moving to baseball it be clear that each team spend the entire season in an environment include all the other team in the league in at least a nominal sense the division winner be the fittest team in the league in that they on average have better fitnes score than any of their compete opponennt but in a real sense there be a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that be difficult if not impossible to account for in term of factor intrinsic to or interest for baseball the same be true in biology but here be also no direct biological equivalent of the world series in basebal in the world series the random component may be greatly magnify by the small number of game that be play and both team suddenly experience huge change from the environement where they be originally successful it might be fun to watch but it unclear what it all really mean now just one more un-related point i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon on the other hand you have see some of u who can predict the outcome of the divisional race better than a random assignment of team to finish and maybe some of u me who can do thi better than the other participant in thi forum on a regular basi but thi be probably only due to the fact that a schedule gife you a little hope that bad hop be the only difference between the winner and the loser moreover you have the opportunity to see some analysi of the world series situation that make the strong claim that nobody can predict the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin bias only to reflect the well-known home v road effect on win percentage the stat be a nice hobby and that about it there be no new knowledge be produce since stat be summary of event it true that if you know the event you can derive the stat but if somebody be try to understand the proces behind the stat then the stat produce new knowledge and some of thi might even be reliable repeatable and useful speaking of which i should get back to produce knowledge in a different field that be of course if i can produce knowledge even though i rely on stat to do it jking
