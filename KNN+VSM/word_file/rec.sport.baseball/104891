from hbrook subject re basis load walk gife red win in in article m mark singer write in article write in article m mark singer write during spring train i make a similarly innoncent-looking comment about clutch hit on thi bb and the flame be fly no such thing a clutch hit they the sdcn all scream i assume they also mean there wa no such thing a any kind of clutch performance give their comment i still lick the wind but i do have a rebuttal plan get tum do my homework a they say some deletion rather they show quite convincingly that past clutch performance ha never be able to predict future clutch performance i sure you be convince dave apparently so be tony perez i however be not i believe at the time of the sabo plate appearance that juan samuel wa on the bench available for pinch-hit duty over the past fmy season non-clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo samuel i do not claim that thi be a complete statistical analysi that prove the existence of clutch hit or compel testimony that samuel would have get a base hit i sure there be something wrong with the sample size or that the basic assumption that clutch performance be random invalidate any conclusion from thi limit application or something or other i do pretend to understand statistical analysi well we agree on the last part one of the basic thing you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player performance on it in the future be for there to be a correlation from year to year a player bat average be correlate fairly well from year to year a player ability to walk or infielder defensive average be correlate better that be to say give their past performance in those statistic we can have a pretty good handle on how they do next year put in some simple information about age and you can do even better one of the basic problem with something like clutch bat average overall bat average be that the correlation from year to year be almost zero adding to the sample size do seem to help much a a counterexample to what you show consider the follow two player from non-clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba maldonado lemon if you have have these two player in by ymy logic in those clutch situation you bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye well in maldonado hit in non-clutch and in clutch while lemon hit in non-clutch and in clutch before you accuse me of completely cook the datum there be player who have clutch at bat every year from accord to elia a a simple measure of clutchnes let just look at clutch ba-non-clutch ba if you use to predict for those player you find that of the be below league average in that measure both in and in be above league average in both period and the other be above in one and below in the other if you be just flip coin you expect to get in both and that switch the difference between the observe result and the coin flip experiment be not statisically significant btw correlate player overall bat average from with gife a correlation coefficient of which be significant at something better than the confidence level correlating their clutch-non-clutch ba for the same period gife a correlation of significant at no level of any interest everyone would agree i hope that a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth when ymy team be down by three be a very clutch hit there be just no way to predict who be more likely to get the clutch hit base on past performance hit in clutch situation if you say so dave no way actually it technically incorrect to say that we ca predict future clutch performance it more correct to say that we ca predict future clutch performance with any skill harold harold brook hbrook national severe storm laboratory norman ok i use to work for a brewery too but i do drink on the job p bavasi on dal maxvill view that florida can win the nl east in
