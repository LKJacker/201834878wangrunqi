from tedward edward ted fischer subject re basis load walk gife red win in in article m mark singer write in article tedward edward ted fischer write sigh here we go again you start it for predict the future it ha be entirely meaningles at least if it ha mean we do know how to find it i do not say i could predict the future you most certainly do non-clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo samuel sabo be clearly a better hitter than samuel yet you would pinch-hit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter right i call that predict the future if you be to have be the red manager at that time i assume you would have have some basi for let sabo hit rather than pinch hit samuel i sure some of that basi would have utilize prior performance you just would have use thi particular aspect of prior performance is thi not correct right i would have use aspect of prior performance which have be show to be consistent in the past overall performance split even match style all of these will give me some advantage if use properly even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gain by look at past clutch performance and in thi case everything else point to sabo one more time i do not claim to be able to predict the future i say that i accept the above datum a an indication that samuel would have have a better chance for succes in that situation than sabo that come down to the same thing when perez leave sabo in he wa predict the future the next ab he wa predict that sabo wa more likely to get a hit than samuel by support the swap you be predict the opposite and i be not dismiss ymy work i state my opinion you be say that ymy work render any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion be some kind of insult to ymy work well ye you be aware of it existance you claim to be incapable of understand it though i suspect you be simply unwilling yet you rather forcefully state the opposite you do seem to think the work be worth read yet you obviously feel the topic be important i say thi be insult i do not say that it be a consistent skill i have say that it be an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstance right thi be the beef it ha not prove to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstance at least none that we be able to come up with if you know of some where it be an indicator of future performance please let u in on ymy secret it be nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceive bias most certainly a i have repeatedly state if you can come up with a study which even hint at a consistent clutch ability i would love it however the straightforward attempt at such a study have all fail miserably yeah hindsight be alway do that make you bright thi be a stupid argument and you know it ah i know we could get to the name call and there that word you like so much well it wa a stupid argument are you honestly debate that sure we know sabo do get a hit we have no idea whether samuel would have do any better or not one ab most certainly do prove anything i believe that by season end that chri sabo bat average in clutch situation will be significantly lower than hi bat average in non-clutch situation i ca prove that it will happen so i gues we just have to wait and see is thi simply a prediction for chri sabo for thi year or be thi a prediction for all batter who have over the past few year hit xxx amount worse in the clutch than overall if you mean the first then a you say we just have to wait and see but the second be a much stronger statement in fact it suggest a rule we can then test thi rule on past datum to see if it work for recent year i think you will agree that if the rule do work last year or the year before that it be unlikely to do any better thi year right here another one for you in joe carter bat average in clutch situation wa significantly below hi bat average in non-clutch situation each year i presume you think thi be random i not go to get into case analysi sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from and then hit poorly in a well you can also find those who hit poorly from and then hit well in no thi do prove any overall statistical trend that can be use to predict future performance acros the breadth of major league ballplayer it just make me think that in joe carter bat average in the clutch be not go to be a high a hi ba in non-clutch situation gambler fallacy unles there be reason to expect consistency a run prove nothing can you give u a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next i see a detail study of why i expect it to correlate stupid total idiot my my such hostility the stupid wa in reference to a statement which wa stupid and i do see how you can deny it a for total idiot ye if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you be wrong i would say the term fit nicely so tell me do the term fit or do you have an open mind valentine
