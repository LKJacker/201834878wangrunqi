from fester mike fester subject re white and black racism wa about the philly in article king jonathan king write there too many here for my taste by now which mean i reach my maximum depth on thi thread i cut out some thing below but nothing that should affect the sense of the discussion i agree i delete more a well fester mike fester write king jonathan king write perhap you can give a more recent citation of any player mention a a malingerer thank i gues i do understand ymy question i wa try to imply that the accusation of glenn davi malinger be certainly not play up very much still if the reach san francisco it be certainly possible they be stronger elsewhere also it wa teammate make the aspersion in any event i know of no other player to be malign in the last couple year but in any case i believe mike lavalliere ha be accuse of poor work habit and general sloth recently probably not malinger just a he wa be release it interest that nobody hear much about these problem before if they be so important i have hear sander call many thing a well i have not hear him call lazy given the phenomenon it would be difficult to label him a such exactly so which mean hi medium detractor have have to say other thing about him i believe it a general phenomenon that if writer do like you they find a label that will stick no matter who you be i find myself more interest in the selection of label than in why writer feel they need to act thi way not that thi fascinate me that much either uh the original author point wa that black and white player be por trayed differently by the medium and toward thi he give a highly select list to prove hi case sander name show up eventually i dispute that sander ha ever be call lazy by the medium hmm big ego possible club house disturbance etc is that good pres no but it be the total extent of the pres he receive in pittsburgh where he wa call all kind of thing include lazy and spoil by the local columnist again the actual word use may shift around with time and expediency but lazy tend to be higher on the list for non-white player at least in my subjective opinion aside it might be interest for somebody to do an archival study on player description before and after the color barrier wa break and on team like the red sox which have be traditionally white nowaday most person think of carl yastrzemski a one of those blue-collar hard-working guy but in the early he wa often portray a a lazy bum really hmm i never hear anyone accuse canseco of be lazy nor sierra i hear accusation that canseco wa a bad fielder but could be a great one if he put hi mind to it ignoring whether or not he be a actually dave stewart be wa one of the most vocal about thi in any event that be not lazy at least one poster in the last week ha fire off a major screed on the canseco-is-lazy issue so i think ymy point be at best a quibble and probably weaker than that uh that poster specifically state allow me to be the first it be not a quibble then to state that the medium do not portray canseco a be lazy if the other person choose to so accuse him after my post that do not make it a quibble and in fact the medium around here tend ed to play up hi time in the wieght room hardly lazy and hardly a quibble have you ever see any mediot portray canseco a lazy unconcerned with hi field ye lazy no bad fielder i think thi be still interest for that matter i think canseco colorful off-field antic get lot more national attention than those of say roger clemen well he have a few more of them at least more that you hear about i think one of the question here surround selective report having say that i have to say that the selective report hypothesi ha the potential to be unfalsifiable at least by those of u who be reporter polouse or private investigator well canseco ha be involve in several felony include hi high-speed record carry conceal fire-arm and of course the domestic violence clemen have a run-in at a bar canseco have that a well and in both case the coverage wa relatively minimal puckett stewart jackson i say over-represent non-white three anecdotal datum point do make an interest counter-argument btw which jackson be we talk about here reggie bo darrin danny or uh if the only evidence offer be anecdotal how can it be object that the counter to it be also anecdotal and it seem like everybody who ha ever win a bat title among other ha be accuse at some time of care more for hi own stat than for the good of the team it also seem to me that you kirby puckett i have never hear thi accusation make of puckett i have hear it of bogg actually i believe it of him but that another matter not live in minnesotum i ca say whether or not thi line ha ever be use against kirby there a far a bogg go i not sure why you bring him up since he one of the obviou prototype for the line i quote along with ted william rod carew and many other uh ye and i agree with ymy assesment of bogg rather specifically however you do say everybody who ha ever win a bat title ha be accuse of selfishnes i have not ever anywhere hear thi say of puckett pendleton either similarly brett b william and other how about daryl strawberry and i think the plu or minu refer more to the bear again type ie butler and gaettus again you seem to be make an argument from anecdote on the other hand my argument by be of the because-jon-says-so variety if we have no other datum i have to admit i have problem generate list of non-white player who become in famou for their religiou or political belief while name like butler gaettus dravecky knepper hersheiser et al come roll out there be other perhap they be simply not a outspoken except in the case of the born-again type i mention mike
