from tedward edward ted fischer subject re pleasant yankee surprise in article m mark singer write i do have a history handy but i do recall that the preponderance of roy come from win team in fact i think team performance be generally irrelevant a almost alway the most deserve candidate win am i wrong not really though i would personally say the most deserve candidate win rarely do a player win roy when call up in mid season and there have be several dud in recent year but thi be more a factor of mediot bias than anything else i wonder if amaral hit like he be capable of will he receive roty vote he only he could have a long career ahead of him and he be not necessarily on a lose team while the angel staff be still very weak their everyday lineup be do quite well thank you snow be play great salmon be learn to make the adjustment easley appear fine but even if he not flora be ready to come up between gonzale and gruber they manage the hot corner polonium and curti be steady and heady even myer and orton be contribute personally i think they can finish over which make them a win team i think they be a second-division team they should finish ahead of the royal mariner and possibly athletic but i do think they be above i think the east be stronger thi year last year their pitch wa bad and their offense wa horrible thi year their offense be better but their pitch be still pretty bad even if finley return to form he wo replace what they lose in abbott sanderson farrell i do believe it and while their ba may be good and they have decent speed their offense lack punch they do have any bona fide power hitter salmon snow davi and curti none with more than hr potential cheer valentine which al team have the most steal last week those go-go tiger the mediot finally manage to convince them that they need more balance in their lineup you see they be score too many run too consistently got tum run more to break that up
