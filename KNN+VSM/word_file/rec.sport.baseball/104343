from tedward edward ted fischer subject old prediction to laugh at oop i come acros thi file from last year thought you might enjoy some of these think the prediction be make on the date indicate they be largely out of order june tedward me what have i do i compute the expect win percentage for each team from their obp total basis and run allow i use the basic rc formula and the pythagorean projection i then compare thi with their actual win percentage all stat through june team obp tb ra w l xwp diff baltimore boston toronto new york milwaukee detroit cleveland minnesotum oakland texa chicago californium kansa city seattle you all know how thing turn out the oriole red sox and yankee all disappear the jay and tiger continue at essentially the expect pace the brewer and indian crank in the second half the ranger predictably take a dive that should have surprise anybody meanwhile a predict the mariner drop behind the angel and royal they clearly do deserve the record in june the white sox and a up their game a bite while the twin drop off a little but for the most part thing be a expect okay so there be a few blatant error but for a predictive calculation i think thi do pretty well from cavgeoe tue mar the brave insert kent mercker into the start rotation sometime thi year bielecki be trade or release lei brandt become the fifth starter and the best bullpen in baseball ha pena berenguer stanton wohler freeman and pete smith who spot-start a well hm pete smith make the rotation instead of mercker and bielecki wa release until the end of the year i wo comment on the bullpen jeff reardon blauser win the start shortstop job outright by the end of may bream go on the dl and klesko go on a nice hit honeymoon a la gregg jeffery in platooning with hunter mitchell win the center field job a bite later all-star break and nixon stay on a a valuable pinch-runner lonnie be release unles the brave find a taker in a trade right on blauser wrong on bream and mitchell a bite early on lonnie a with bielecki did pick sander did anybody manager to be fire thi year in chronological order fregosi showalter valentine riddoch three of them go right showalter be still around and likely to stick it seem from mattel tue mar bond get trade from buc for some young talent nope they win the division and so keep him for a shoot at the playoff met win division well they do finish last atlantum repeat in the west got that one right yankee surprise everyone but finish second behind toronto nope dwight gooden win but be surpass by saberhagen who win i gues thi be why you pick the met to win huh roger clemen be injure early in the season tsk tsk not nice to predict something like thi strawberry fail to hit even home run and be often injure due to dodger drop out of race you get that right and my response from tedward tue mar hmph can tell you be a met fan do you mind if i make some counter prediction against your they follow met come in third behind pittsburgh and montreal okay so the met finish fifth but i get the pirate and expo right the yankee offense and pitch flounder drop them to fourth place in the al east boston win game the division the pennant and the world series first half dead on second half ummm i a sox fan go easy on me dwight gooden rush hi comeback get blow out and go on the dl from may through mid-july saberhagen run a record wfan criticize the met for give away that great talent jeffery who ha a solid year in kc so i get my prediction for gooden and saberhagen reverse i wa at least close and wa right about jeffery though i do know ha wfan criticize the jeffery trade roger clemen win another cy a well a game close no cigar in article amit likhyani write excerpt from re nl east smiley cavgeoe op projected for hojo i will streak naked down forbe avenue if hojo do not muster more than a op something be wrong with that projection some prediction need no introduction from navarra mon apr from tedward do you care to put ymy prediction down for posterity you predict mark grace will get rbi i say you be out of ymy mind that be almost impossible for a type guy bat behind dawson who kill most of the rally he do finish why do you say that mark ha drive in and last year mark wa bat second primarily and it wa hi worse year average wise since he be bat either or thi year i predict he will be back up to hi previou standard i think he will be better rbi be not that much of a stretch sometime u stathead get lucky grace hit behind dawson the entire season but he also finish with only rbi from tue may the most ballsy prediction ever mark mcgwire will hit or more hr thi year nope he slow down and the injury finish him off did even reach but a ballsy prediction nonetheles from ecaxron thu may baltimore will not fade they will not win the division thi year but they will finish within five game i find the prospect of two oriole win each easier to comprehend than that of two sox no offense i think their pitch be about a good a the division ha to offer the oriole finish seven game out none of them win though mussina might have have a chance with better relief and more start nobody else in the division be worth a darn they all finish a minimum of fifteen game out the tribe that another reason to watch baltimore thi year and next they wo waste many of those game against the rest of the division except for the brewer who you probably forget you be right the rest of the division wa thoroughly mediocre the yankee and indian lead with win the red sox trail with win none be horrible but fmy be five or more game below from djohnson david johnson date thu aug gmt right that wa me i never say the jay be a cinch to clinch it but i say that milwaukee will be more of a threat than baltimore i do think that toronto should win it but after i do consider anything a cinch unles you have something like a game lead with game to go i do think that the jay have the best talented team in the al east and if we have a good or even average manager we might have a bigger lead right now i also think that the oriole will not play much better than baseball for the rest of the season you win from king thu nov in article you write indian the first and only season ever prediction the cleveland indian will win or more game next year you be right from stvja frus sep jose rijo will win the cy young award if he be healthy enough to go at least ip who would have think he would try to steal a base why risk such an injury he have ip but do win the cy young maddux surprise all the oriole will win game in at least of the next year probably the last and their pitch staff will have a team era among the best in the al in at least of the next year but not necessarily all the same year a they win thi one will take a long time to verify i do think i want to wait that long but they win game last year and they be fifth in the league in era not a bad start ben mcdonald will not challenge for an era title in the next year nor will he have victory either year by challenge i mean finish among the leader be among the leader before the season be do do count he will probably never be the pitcher he wa hype to be but be still a decent starter to have look like it he wa bad last year just too consistent to be an ace so far thi year look like more of the same the philly will give up many fewer walk they get rid of their bullpen coach ryan i be not predict when or whether they will get rid of him and you will have to give the team a little bite of time to adjust before see the radical change they would have a fine pitch staff if they would just steal ray miller away from pittsburg the white sox seem to have the same problem but not a bad i honestly ca say did they get rid of him their bb total be down last year ricky jordan will have rbi if he start game hit in the or or spot in any lineup or the spot in a lineup with very good obp in the hitter thi apply for each of the next year i just do think he that good billy ripken will never again hit over with ab so far so good i definitely not wait to check thi one from panix spira frus sep no matter what lou gorman and hi scout say paul quantrill will never ever be an adequate major league starter never i have never see a start pitcher who can only strike out per inning at aaa be successful in the major current plan seem to be to use quantrill in long relief he ha a rubber arm and unusual delivery he might be decent in that role from lyle sat sep frank thoma hal morri division winner east baltimore oriole west chicago white sox pennant chicago white sox east st loui cardinal west cincinattus red pennant cincinattus red champion cincinattus red wrong on all of the above hal morri and my favorite from tedward sun oct belle will not walk a many a time in belle will hit more hr than he ha walk in belle hit hr last year walk time but five of those be intentional okay so i exaggerate but i might have be right from trn tue mar are the o go to sign cal of be eli wallet weld shut outgo money only wide open for incoming cash my prediction which you may make note of valentine be that eli jacob will defer any seriou negotiation on cal ripken contract until the season be over eli will give cal every opportunity to have hi stat tumble a bite from last year pace before come forth with an offer despite claim that op cy wa design to cal strength my feel be that the foot left-center canyon will cut down on cal power stat after all it hard to credibly to offer to an all-star game glove deity but it be a lot easier to offer a similar salary to an obviously decline but above average shortstop who have a career year one full season ago of course if cal do match hi number then eli be go to be face with a rather huge and expensive problem how much do cal sign for when do he sign if i remember correctly he get a rather hefty contract despite a weak season and finally from jpalmer thu sep generally because of expansion in there will be a lot of mediocre talent hang around much of it will not make it a the expansion team look for younger talent around which to build their team my specific prediction a of april jim acker and cory snider will be sell aluminum side snyder be still in sf acker be go neither charlie kerfeld nor vance lovelace presently in tiger aa but formerly big leaguer will be play professional ball they be in the major nor will dave rozema who say he keep in shape with a hope for another shoot with expansion never hear of him shawn hare and jody hurst will be in the major league they be outfielder in the tiger minor league system i do think they be in the major ron hassey will be a minor league manager with the yankee dunno what happen to him it will be bye-bye for balboni if he still around he stick in the minor bo jackson will not be a starter hm with raine out bo look to get a lot of pt gary huckaby will have move to alaska permanently they on the net and dave kirsch will return to canada to live hm thank for listen valentine
