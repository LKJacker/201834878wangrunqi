from todd karlin subject re the met are rapist write in the new book about the met it talk about how they like to rape little girl before game sick jerk max is thi the book by bob klapisch spell the worst team money can buy if it be i would give the book or anything in it any value whatsoever klapisch write the book to make money obviously and sensational literature be go to sell a lot better than what he usually write for the paper i not call him a liar but if there wa any proof that a met player have rap a little girl before a game let alone do it on a regular basi they would be in jail not shea for those person who do not know what the pres be like in new york it be probably more cut-throat than in just about any other part of the keith hernandez say it very well on espn a couple of day ago they would much rather mention a clubhouse fight than a two-run homer in the ninth to win a game i do not read klapisch news column regularly but i do know that he ha be accuse before a be an instigator that enjoy hopefully for only professional reason to drumb up a news story even if there be one there now a far a the confrontation with bobby bonilla a few day ago i almost totally blame bonilla no matter what a member of the pres do and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might be that do not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a journalist personally i alway think that a beat writer that alway follow a club around should report the news but not be look to degrade a team i do know whether to blame klapisch because that may be the only way to keep a job in new york
