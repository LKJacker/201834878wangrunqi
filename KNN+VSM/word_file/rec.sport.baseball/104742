from kubey ken kubey subject re hbp bb big-cat in article dtate david m tate write kubey ken kubey say and finally i like to point out that many high obp guy draw their walk more because pitcher be afraid to throw a strike to them than because they have a great eye i not sure i use to think thi wa true but more and more i become convince that it the other way around among player with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard the patient one be the one who get the chance to do it a lot let break down the fmy basic category of hitter accord to whether they be power threat and whether they walk a lot power no power patient frank thoma brett butler barry bond ozzie smith mark mcgwire craig grebeck babe ruth miller huggin ted william billy hamilton rickey henderson eddie joost joe morgan mike hargrove impatient ernie bank ozzie guillen dave kingman shawon dunston joe carter andre thoma george bell jose lind kirby puckett devon white okay i think we all agree that single hitter should take a strike or two and try to get on base any way they can so the no guy have no excuse the no guy be do the right thing now the guy how could you leave out the big cat would these guy have a better slug percentage if they take more pitch perhap but i doubt it if you tell joe carter to go up there and take a few pitch he will draw more walk but he also wo hit a many freeze rope into the bleacher because he be more likely to hold back on a pitch that he use to drive the guy joe morgan have a small strike zone and rickey henderson ha a strike zone the size of hitler heart so they get their walk base on the small zone look at the other guy thoma bond mcgwire ruth and william wow a lot of pitcher would rather nibble at the corner and maybe walk these guy that to throw a clear strike to them the pitcher would do better in my opinion by just come after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch but pitcher would rather nibble go or and then get hurt ken kubey kubey
