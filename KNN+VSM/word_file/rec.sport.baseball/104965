from brown philip h subject bosio no-hitter i watch the final inning of bosio no-hitter with several person at work after vizquel make that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle someone remark that if he have field it with hi glove he would have have time to throw rile out yet the throw beat rile by about two step i wonder how many other who watch the final out think vizquel have no choice but to make the play with hi bare hand do anybody think vizquel wa wrong to field the ball barehanded and if he fail to field it cleanly would it or should it have be an error or a hit judging from bosio grimace when the ball bounce past him he must have think it would go through for a hit whether vizquel wa right or wrong he certainly make one hell of a play phil brown aka
