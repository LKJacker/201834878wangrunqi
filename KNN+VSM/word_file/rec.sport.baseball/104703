from dtate david m tate subject mvp revisited tim shippert recently post summary of last year defensive average stat in term of the linear weight estimate run-value of defensive performance compare to league average i combine those with my position-adjusted mlv number to come up with first-approximation total run value for player last year we can use these a a springboard for reconsideration of the mvp award major caveat these number include no defensive park adjustment so if san diego really be just a question of odd score or gopher hole in the infield that will cause some inaccuracy the offensive number be position-adjusted but not park adjust so we have to deflate some and inflate other to be fair finally we still do know what to do about catcher and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contribution of tony phillip and bip robert having say that there be still some surprise let look national league first all number in total run contribute over the season player offense defense total sandberg bond walker justice daulton larkin grace a i see it these be the legitimate mvp candidate from last season if you deflate sandberg offense a wee bite for play in wrigley you get essentially a dead heat had bond be hi usual defensive self it would have be close but that apparently wa the case darren daulton need or more defensive run to make up the offensive difference and i could tell you whether that easy or impossible a good case could be make for any of sandberg bond or daulton a top dude my personal vote bond sandberg daulton walker justice in the american league player offense defense total ventura martinez b anderson thoma r henderson raine tettleton ok let see a show of hand how many of you pick robin ventura a top player in the al last year i certainly do but i have a hard time argue against him at thi point ye i know these number be only approximate but that a big gap between him and the guy also those of you who think rickey henderson stink last year be out of ymy mind once again there a catcher in the ointment if call a game be a important a it might be run be easy to make up or give away take a gues folk i do think we can do any better than that my personal vote exclude pitcher ventura tettleton anderson martinez henderson i a big frank thoma fan but i have to admit to a bia in favor of balance contribution which should have a higher leverage in record than an equal shift that be lot of offense with negative defense for the record carlo baerga roberto alomar forget it it a wash let me also take thi opportunity to admit that i wa grossly wrong regard don mattingly defense thi past season don recover brilliantly from hi weak and to end up with mattingly run which be clearly an above-average first baseman however it still run behind mark mcgwire run behind frank thoma and run behind john olerud on the other hand it ahead of rafael palmeiro cecil fielder and every other al first baseman not yet mention david m tate dtate greeting sir with bat not quick member iie orsa tim sabr hand not soft eye not discern and in denver they call you a slugger the big catullu galarraga and compare you to my own mattingly
