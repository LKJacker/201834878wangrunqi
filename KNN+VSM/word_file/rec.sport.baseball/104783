from richard l trionfo subject re wfan i hope that thi come off a a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wip i go to school in philadelphium and i listen to both station on a consistant basi now that the fan ha mike lupica on from to noon they have a person who can get the big name guest for interview and not just of local importance he do have dave chekett and fred wilpon on hi show but he have bob costa and magic johnson on too now here be my opinion of the two station compete talent morning show in my opinion i think imu be much better than bruno cataldi and morgantus even though i would feel different if morgantus have a better crew of person to work with to me wip try to copy imu but make it all sport a a theme in term of sport imu lack the blanket of the airwave but he interject humor and politic into hi show am to noon i think chuck cooperstein and lupica be equal in their ability to host a radio show but i think chuck ha the advantage over lupica in term of deal with the caller who be ask about who the local team be go to draft in the sixth round lupica and the other host on fan get better interview guest but i hear the pd of wip say that they be not interest in interview with celebrity unles it wa a major story i would consider thi even because they be two different style of host noon to pm at thi point i would have to give a big advantage to jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny ha only be on for a couple of week i just think jm ha the ability to transcend the homer mentality of the philadelphium fan base thi be most evident when the iggle philadelphium spell play the cowboy because jm be a huge dalla fan where else can you have person call up and predict a score without the egg of the host re wip morning i do agree that jm wa great on the fan weekend overnight and i mi hear him over the current crop of rotate host i feel that jm be the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin if you be in ny and you ca get wip jm do fill in on the weekend sometime to thi be the time when jm go up against francesa and russo fatso and froot loop and i become the most divide in my loyalty mike and the dog be very entertain but they often go an hmy or so without call or even to minute without talk about sport matd do get great guest and that be the basi for their show so it be like the to debate another plu be the appearance by mike and chri on imu in the morning which be often hilariou pm to pm matd go up against frederick and missanelli i like mike missanelli but i just ca stomach steve frederick i know that sf come from philly originally but when he wa at the fan he wa a ny homer a much a he be a philly homer now i do listen to wip much after pm unles there be a game on that night but you will see later for the reason that be why i give the advantage to fan pm to midnight s m be on wip until and then it be the man who make eli that call matd all the time seem like a novice on charge of racism g cobb thi man be so grate on my nerve that if i listen to him for a few minute i go nut i know that be bias but listen to hi show on fan there be usually a game on knick ranger met jet or st john basketball if the game be on the west coast then it be usually howie rose of course i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip but wip do air sixer and flyer game during the season if thi be the sport station why do they lose the iggle to wysp home of howard stern in phil during the summer it be all talk on wip overall i would have to give the advantage to wfan with the exception of to and to where it be even and to where wip ha the advantage rich you read the hat now see the movie imu in the morning a blurb you a blurb seinfeld
