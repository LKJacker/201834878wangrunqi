from noel noel rappin subject re usa mcweekly stat rvesterm write some discussion about whether elia be money grub delete funny it seem to me that the stat major league and minor league handbook which be nothing but collection of statistic be author by bill jame and stat inc and howe for the minor league handbook and i be not sure how the bill jame player rat book qualify a a book with statistic while the elia analyst be a statistic book the analyst contain more stat sure but it also contain more dialogue finally the point wa not about the word statistic it wa about money-grubbing i do see how anyone who ha look at the bill jame player rat book can not consider him money-grubbing bob vesterman some think and fact bill jame be a partial owner of stat inc however he ha almost nothing to do with the day-to-day operation of the company although he do have significant input into the design of the book that bear hi name the handbook but not the scoreboard to the best of my knowledge the only thing that bill actually write for stat be the prediction section of the handbook and the bill jame fantasy baseball rulebook the debate over elia go way back bill jame early stuff wa hamper by the fact that elia would not give acces to their stat at any price project scoresheet and later stat be found to fill thi void you can call stat and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database and they will provide it for a price of course or you could just log into their online system and look at the datum yourself having attempt to pry number from elia in the past football not baseball they just do do that in stat eye the high grind come from make the information available at all that be say i pretty dissapointed by bill book thi year too i be give to understant that it wa mostly a response to the publisher desire to have the book come out sooner than april hope thi make thing just a little bite clearer bia alert i be a former part-time employee of stat noel rappin noel
