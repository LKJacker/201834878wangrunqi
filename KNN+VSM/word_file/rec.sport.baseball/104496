from pcaster dodger subject re dodger question the dodger have be shop harri to other team in their quest for more left-handed pitch so far no taker personally i think harri be a defensive liability and he ha also lead the team in past year for hit into double play or at least be among the leader sharperson show last year that if give a chance to play every day he can get the job do if sharpy play just one base every day say third he also improve defensively wallach ha help tremendously on defense a ha reed the improve defense be quite noticeable and be have an effect on the pitch staff both astacio and martinez be bail out in recent start by great defensive play martinez pitch into the ninth in a game that might have see him lift in the third in past year astacio last inning the other day under similar circumstance the dodger be turn double play and keep more ball in the infield than last year and piazza ha also be great on defense he ha throw out of batter try to steal and ha at least one pick off at first wallach clearly ha contribute to the over all improvement on defense but hi offense be awful and he ha cost the dodger some run but i do think he be a bad a hi current average i suspect he will come out of thi slump much a davi and straw seem to have come out of their dodger
