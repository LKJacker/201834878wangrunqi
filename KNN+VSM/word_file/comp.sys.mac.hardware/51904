from subject re quadra scsi problem attention mac quadra owner many storage industry expert have conclude that mac quadra suffer from time irregularity deviate from the standard scsi specification thi result in silent corruption of datum when use with some device include ultra-modern device although i will not name the device since it be not their fault an example would be a sony inch mo without the special mac-compatible firmware instal one solution sometime be to disable blind write to the best of my knowledge there be any problem with quadra and blind transfer trouble with blind transfer usually mean the programmer screw up the tib or do test their driver with the device in question well design tib poll or loop at every point where delay of occur thi usually occur at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some device can hiccup in the middle of block if thi happen in the middle of a blind transfer there be the possibility of lose or gain a byte depend on which direction the tranfer wa go in anycase the scsi manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it be out of sync actual datum los would only occur if the driver do pay attention to the error come back note that thi effect be not cause by anything actually on the scsi bu but rather by the transfer loop inside the scsi manager the problem occur when the processor bu error try to acces the scsi chip when the next byte ha be clock yet also note that the bu error be deal with by a bu error handler and do crash the machine clinton bauder apple computer
