from guykuo guy kuo subject re iisi clock upgrade i have read one report of a brave soul who rewire the mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillator output through a double throw switch to allow different speed there wa no mention of any attempt to switch speed on the fly but if the si use time loop anything like a quadra for access it floppy drive dynamic switch will wreak havoc a quadra must reboot after have it clock speed significantly change or it will be unable to properly acces it floppy drive
