from pandemonium dhbutler subject how do they compare also amiga comparisson write the real question here in my opinion be what motorola processor run sy stem on a mac be comparable to what intel processor run window on a pc i stuff delete david even better than that how do a amiga perform in daily task compare to my iicus answer except in a very few case i get my butt kick by the amiga sure there be other consideration but it go to show you how proper design from the begin in hardware and software can give you great return a well a show you that if you do have a market department to speak of no one will care how good ymy system be i have the same experience actually i love the mac interface and any number of the feature but be sorely dissapointed with the speed i use mac daily and be a moc consultant for osu statistic department i familiar with almost every model out there and my experience be that both the amiga and the atarus st simply blow the mac out of the water in term of performance at thi time i would in general say that the other advantage of the mac outweigh the advantage of the amiga or the st and falcon but i really wish apple would get their head together on speed they could take a real lesson in muli-tasking from the amiga o or the multito in the atarus falcon too i still happy with my cu but i do understand why the performance be so bad comparatively they could have do multi-tasking properly they could have do everthing else better but apple do of course do and window be nothin to write home about either i just hope that someone come out with a machine that do everything well someday if i have my choice i would go with mac in most aspect but add the speed and superior multi-tasking of the other platform a for the original topic trying to compare just the chip in a machine seem almost worthles a fast with a wiz-bang graphic accelerator will be faster in productivity for many application than a even a stock quadra add a graphic accelerator to a and you really fly of course add one the the quadra and then you blow the away etc oh well get worth for the price of i think mine wa only worth david butler dhbutler thi be not a novel to be toss away lightly it should be throw with great force dorothy parker
