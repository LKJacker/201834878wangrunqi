from carter carter gregory subject re computer engr v computer science in article chyang chung hsiung yang write in article tecot edward m tecot write a professor of mine once say the difference between a computer engineer and a computer scientist be about mean the engineer make more than the be not just a joke scott for the most part thi be a bunch of bunk i get a computer engineering degree yet i spend the last year write software that person actually use moreover the salary distinction be incorrect i receive job offer upon graduation the two job that actually use my hardware experience be lower my advice be to decide which class and project most interest you and pick the major that allow you to take them emt well here be my worth advice from a grad student i agree with the gentleman who write the comment before me the important thing be pick what ever interest you the most and learn a much a possible about it in my five year of education in thi field though brief compare to alot of person i have to think about thi kind of question a lot did i make the right decision in go into electrical engineering a oppose to computer engineer or cs the more i go thru school the more i believe that thi kind of question be irrelevant interesting a i think computer technology be now becomming widespread enough now that it be no longer a position which must require a degree i know of several person i work with that make just a much a i do and they do even have a b degree in comp scus yet they make a year they also do have to pay grand to thier local university either i think computer program be be reduce to a trade practice than a truly specialty field it will be even more so in the future if ymy interest in cut edge type of stuff and you choose cs a i do i suggest check out the emerge field of software engineering the difficulty for example of design scaleable design environment for individual so that a single person can handle to million line of code all by himself in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment be truly a gigantic problem not go to be solve any time soon unfortunately but hey you could be the person that provide the miss key for some good groundwork i have come to believe that choose cs because one do not like hardware or choose hardware because one do not like to program be really do an injustice of build and computer and make it useful for something everything be interweave and inseparable cs ce and ee be all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other my advice be do limit yourself but make a decision base on which major will give you the best opportunity to learn that of course depend on the curriculum at ymy persective school i would choose a major that allow me to explore a much a possible beside i do know why the school would make a student choose a major before sophamore year hey you may be so interest in thi field that you decide to learn all about the make of computer in which case you suffer a little more and go to grad school about the money do look at the average if you be good you be go to earn more money than anyone else if you be a superstar programmer you will earn million like wise if you be a hotshot computer designer well if ymy like the poor slob in the me you be in no financial position to continue graduate work right out of a top comp scus school the trick be to find some generou inc you work for to pay for the rest of ymy education trust me it the best way to if you do get a top salary which i have alway be a poor slob throughout school but if you follow thi rule shelter you should alway have a computer and you wo go hungry what else could a man want chung yang greg carter
