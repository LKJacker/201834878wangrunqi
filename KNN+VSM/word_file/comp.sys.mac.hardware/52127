from roy roy smith subject re monitor should they be keep on hour a day stubb jerry stubb write the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight along with heat i wonder how hard it would be what it would add to the cost to design desktop machine with a power saver feature build in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine be idle for more than some amount of time thi be pretty standard in portable machine and the same kind of trick could be play spin down disk turn off screen reduce clock speed etc the advantage of thi over just turn the thing off would be you do have to remember to do anything and the machine be still available over the network the tricky part might be in define what constitute inactivity certainly you do want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody ping you but you do want to wake up at least the cpu if somebody log in vium a telnet connection i would worry too much about waste electricity in the winter month that energy be just get turn into heat it may not be a efficient a way to heat a build a the central heat plant but it not too bad in the summer though it a disaster not only be you waste that power but you probably also run the air condition to get rid of the waste heat roy smith roy hippocrate project department of microbiology cole nyu school of medicine first avenue new york ny thi never happen to bart simpson
