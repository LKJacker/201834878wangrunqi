from andy andy sun subject re centri to decstation e-net adapter denni j wilkinson write not necessarily a thrid-party adapter apple do manufacture transceiver for thinwire and twist pair cable medium a well a an aui attachment unit interface transciever they run at each if you use thinwire or you probably also need terminator apple transceiver be self-terminated if i remember correctly but i have no idea about dec the third-party medium adapter be usually cheaper at least in toronto than apple i buy the adapter from asante instead of apple gurman joseph b gurman write the decstation model and come with thinwire only ca say for certain about the model and so ymy best bet that not true only the decstation come with a thinwire bnc coaxial ethernet connector the and all have a single aui ethernet connector only i distinctly remember thi because when get the first and i think all of them be go to be thinwire i eventually have to go back and order desta dec oversized version of an aui-to-bnc adapter that must be use with a transciever cable for the rest of the station my advise to the very original poster beverly be if all you want be to create a lan with two workstation and wo add machine to it ever go for thinwire regardles of the medium type going for utp unshielded twist pair wire require a concentrator which mean extra money and i believe these unit come with at least port a for thicknet it a nightmare and cable be expensive avoid it unles you have no choice the two machine be two floor part on the mac side you will need one thinwire medium adapter from apple or third-party macx make sure you get version wo run on system mactcp which come with macx if you get macx you should be get mactcp with it do use earlier version on a centri you may or may not need a terminator depend on the thinwire medium adapter so just ask the sale if the adapter be self-terminated or not configure mactcp to use ethernet on the decstation side you will need for a model you will only need a t-connector for model you will need an aui-to-bnc adapter get one that can be plug in directly to the aui port of the decstation thi way you save the cost of a transciever cable a aui male to a aui female cable get a terminator ymy two-machine network will look like thi t decstation centri or t decstation centri terminator t t connector thinwire coaxial cable aui-to-bnc thick-to-thin adapter thickwire medium adapter assume self-terminated andy andy sun andy taddle creek road toronto computing coordinator ontario canada department of industrial engineering phone university of toronto fax
