from ryanph subject re se rom gosh i wish person would read the post that they be up to in article dashley doug ashley write seanmcd write in article wgw william g wright write anyway i wa hop someone knowledgeable about mac internal could set me straight be it simply impossible for a mac se to print grayscale or could to use the grayscale feature i believe you need a mac equip with colmy quickdraw i wa tell thi somewhere or other but it i think you will find that the mac se can print grayscale image load with the proper software however the mac se can not display grayscale on the original poster w g wright post an item say that he have buy a new wizz-bang laser printer from apple a select i think which can print grayscale he then say that he can not print grayscale from hi se computer and also that all the he ha deal with agree that it be not possible thi be the one major bugbear about do a party se upgrade compare to apple se to upgrade you will never be able to run color quickdraw it be color quickdraw that control color and grayscale se can print some colmy thi be because quickdraw the original non-colmy version ha the right hook for eight colour some of you will remember the solution to get a colmy screen for ymy se i think that it give you sixteen colour by dither or something there be no reason that apple could release software patch for older computer there be lot of mac pluse classic and se that have be upgrade to and processor which should be perfectly able to deal with color quickdraw but they wont and party be have a difficult time in duplicate the mac rom nutek et al just one caveat i would have think that if you be print a postscript grayscale image onto a postscript grayscale printer that you would be able to do so whatever mac you be use and i be pretty sure that the select be not a postscript printer correct me if i wrong phil ryan melbourne australium
