from gsager gary sager subject re monitor should they be keep on hour a day i wonder how hard it would be what it would add to the cost to design desktop machine with a power saver feature build in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine be idle for more than some amount of time i believe that apple sun and a number of other desktop machine manufacturer have agree with the government to incorporate power-saving technique thi be also something that government in other country be likely to require in the future so expect to see it thi may include the ability for the system to fully power down the monitor vium a controllable power outlet and power it back on automatically is thi a sell on screen saver software company goal for idle power consumption have be set at something like watt for the system not include the monitor do quote me on thi note that in many business the save will be substantial especially if you factor in reduce load on air condition system sun do a study that indicate that simply power off monitor for the night would save the company sun itself on the order of per year putting other and automatic power-saving feature in would probably have greater than double that value given that we be see more and more reason to leave my work and home computer on get faxe automatically get email build power consumption control into all machine ha a potential to cut off the national power consumption base on datum i hear btw when encourage employee to power off monitor when leave work it wa point out that thi should only be do with monitor with the power switch on front there wa some indication that monitor with power switch on the rear be not design to tolerate lot of power cycle thi may only apply to the monitor we use but might be worth check if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back
