from jeff-lab peter pundy subject re how do they compare i gues the real question be who ask the original question and why wa it so broad are we talk pure process power what kind of process btw isolate from every other factor and influence in the system or be we shop for a home computer base on the cpu spec yuck i just finish a project that involf real-time process of serial datum and discover that the program interface assembly ha a lot to do with the power of a cpu in a particular application if what you want to do be easy to code with the instruction set give then not only be it easy but it cheap and quick if you have to fake thing like resolve indirection without a lea instruction then ymy cycle count go through the roof well let not start a flame war about whose computer be better than whose the orginal question wa about classify micro-processor have re-read the entire thread i do think much more can be say without get down into specific propose system with important detail give that it for another cheer everyone peter pundy email i get no witty wisdom to share but have a nice day anyway
