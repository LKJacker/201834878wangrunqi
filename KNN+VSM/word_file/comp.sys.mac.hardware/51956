from mdong papa smurf subject re how do they compare in article write the real question here in my opinion be what motorola processor run system on a mac be comparable to what intel processor run window on a pc i recall there be a conversation here that a run window benchmark at about the same speed a in system i do know if that be true but i would love to hear if anyone ha any technical datum on thi david that seem about right i have a mac iisi with cache card run system my roommate ha a run window and from what i see my iisi be faster in some operation in other they be comparable but keep in mind i strictly speak of operation on the desktop level of window and system not actual computational speed in other program
