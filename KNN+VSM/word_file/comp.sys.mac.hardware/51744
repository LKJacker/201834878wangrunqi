from chyang chung hsiung yang subject re how do they compare in article michael amere write i believe it go or will go powerpc pentium i think thi kind of comparison be pretty useles in general the processor be only good when a good computer be design around it adn the computer be use in it design purpose comparing processor speed be pretty dumb because all you have to do be just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other thing i mean how can you say a be faster than a without give be operational condition can you say the same when you be run a program that use a lot of transidental function knowing that do not have transidental function build in to it fpu and do can you say that be still faster anyway i hope person do not decide upon wether a computer be good or not solely on it processor or how fast a processor be base on it name because one can alway do a certain thing to a processor to speed it up but if we restrict my arguement to for example pure processor architectural issue or how one processor will work well and another will not base on it design then we can get somewhere with my discussion chung yang in a resent article in one of the macmag i think a accelerator wa slightly slower than a accel but thi be use a system design for the so it stand to reason that a system design for an ie quadra would do better so overall i figure or so along the same line the new powerpc stuff be suppose to run the system at the level of a fast quadra but system or whatever will allow time the speed of a in the powerpc base system and wait for the i think it lap the pentium pro-life pro-woman michael amere internet
