table of content for those two piece be include above please familiarize yourself with all three section of thi document before post all piece be available for anonymou ftp from in the directory except for thi introductory faq which appear in multiple newsgroup and be store a the name of each file ha the format of the last part of the group name follow by the faq for be store a and the faq for be store a rtfm store file a compress z binary file if you leave off the z at the end of the file name when get the file rtfm will automatically decompres the file before send it to you you can also have these file mail to you by send an e-mail message to mail-server with the line send name in the body text where name be the name of the file you want a specify above general-faq you can also send thi server a message with the subject help for more detail instruction i have a question congratulation you come to the right place usenet be a wonderful resource for information range from basic question how do i lock a floppy disk to query that would make steve job himself run scream from the room in terror i use resedit to remove resource init wdef and nvir from my system file and use the hex editor to add code string a a patch to the sfgetfile routine so the standard file dialog box would be a nice shade of mauve everything work fine until i instal supercdevblaster and now when i use the aldu driver to print from pagemaker to a linotronic my system hang i run system on a powerbook since the macintosh newsgroup be medium to high volume we ask that you first peruse thi faq list include at least the table of content for the other piece of it check any other relevant on-line resource list below in question especially the faq list for the other macintosh newsgroup and rtfm read the friendly manual before post ymy question we realize that you be personally incense that the system be take up fourteen of ymy newly-installed twenty meg of ram but thi question ha already make it way around the world three hundred time before and it develop tire foot finally before post to any newsgroup macintosh or otherwise please familiarize yourself with the basic etiquette of usenet a describe in the newsgroup how do i use thi document where can i get it be currently divide into multiple piece a general introduction which you read now and specific list for the newsgroup and faq list for and be in development when ready each part will be available in it respective newsgroup all piece be available vium anonymou ftp from in the directory except for thi document itself which be name the piece be name a per the last part of the newsgroup they cover follow by faq the z mean the file be store compress so you need to ftp it in binary mode and use either maccompres stuffit deluxe or the unix uncompres command to decompres it however if you leave off the z extension when you get the file rtfm will automatically decompres the file before send it to you thi introductory document be post to all of the concern newsgroup the table of content for each of the specific faq list be at the begin of thi file so you should be able to get at least some idea whether ymy question be answer anywhere else in the faq even if you do have the other part at hand it not alway obviou especially to newcomer where a particular question or comment should be post please familiarize yourself with the faq list in all the major macintosh newsgroup before post in any of them which question appear in which faq can serve a a basic guide to what post belong where to jump to a particular question search for enclose in parenthesis for example to find where can i ftp macintosh software search for the string to jump to a section instead of a question use a zero for the question number what other information is available provide short answer to a number of frequently ask question appropriate for the usenet newsgroup and fmy other file be worthy of particular note daryl spitzer maintain a faq list cover macintosh program for the newsgroup it post to that group weekly and available for anonymou ftp from in eric rosen maintain a frequently ask question list for available in that newsgroup and from in where the file you read now be also irregularly archive thi list answer many frequently ask question about network unix and the mac telecommunication and foreign file format norm walsh ha compile an excellent faq for that answer a lot of question about the variou kind of font and cross-platform conversion and print it available in or by ftp from in finally jim jagielski maintain a faq for cover apple unix environment it post every to week in and it available for anonymou ftp at which newsgroup should i post to there be no stupid question but there be misplace one you would ask ymy english teacher how to do the definite integral of ln x between zero and one would you so do ask the programmer newsgroup why ymy system be so slow when microsoft word be in the background ignorance of basic netiquette be not an excuse if you want person to help you you need to learn their way of communicate posting question to the proper newsgroup will fill ymy mailbox with pearl of wisdom and maybe a few rotten oyster too posting to the wrong newsgroup often engender a thunder silence for instance the most common and glare mispost one that seem a incongruou to dweller in the macintosh region of usenet a would a purple elephant to aleut in the arctic ask a question about network anywhere except normally produce no useful response posting the same question to ensure that ymy post be read and consider by dozen of experience network administrator and not a few network software designer please post to exactly one newsgroup do not cross-post if a question be important enough for you to take the extra minute to figure out where it properly belong it not important enough for several thousand person to spend their time read for the same reason should not be use a a catch-all newsgroup the breakdown of question between different newsgroup in thi document can also serve a a reasonable guide to what belong where specifically question about productivity application software you buy ymy macintosh to run not software you buy to make ymy macintosh run better should go to unles the application be cover in a more specific newsgroup communication program game hypercard compiler and databasis all have more topical newsgroup post question about non-communication hardware include question about what software be necessary to make particular hardware work to question about maco system software belong in question about utility and extension normally belong in question about go to detailed question about appletalk belong in direct question about hypercard to non-hypercard program question and question about development environment should go to resedit question may be post either to or but generally the netter who inhabit the darker recess of be considerably more practice at the art of resource hack a general exception to the above rule be that any very technical question about an application that actually begin to delve into the how of a program a well a the what recent example how do writenow which be write entirely in assembly compare to other word processor write in high level language might be better address to the programmer newsgroup for sale and want to buy post should go to and only we understand that you desperate to sell ymy upgrade mac to get the for a powerbook but trust me anyone who want to buy it will be read political and religiou question the mac be better than window is not is too is not is too hey how the amiga what about it is not is too belong in anything not specifically mention above probably belong in finally do be so provincial a to consider only the newsgroup the appropriate forum for ymy question many question about modem in be much more thoroughly discuss in question about mac midi be often better handle in even though it not a macintosh specific newsgroup shop around usenet a big place and not everything relevant to the macintosh happen in someone just asked why the system wa taking up sixteen of their twenty megabyte of ram should i put my brilliance and wit on display for the world by posting the seventeenth response no frequent answer be just a bore and uninteresting a frequent question unles you really have something new to add to the traditional answer such a the recent discovery that font in system could eat memory private e-mail be a much better medium for answer common question like thi one you might want to add a mention of thi faq in ymy e-mail response and a polite suggestion that ymy correspondent read it before post future question i do read all the newsgroup cover here and have write a small script in microphone ius that let me send pwfaq person with frequently ask question the section of thi document that answer their question with just the click of a button so please do feel obligate to respond to someone who care so little about the answer to their question they ca be trouble to read the faq list to get it ftp where can i ftp mac software the three major north american internet archive of shareware freeware and demo software be and which mirror the other two site and several other wuarchive often hold on to file after other site remove them for space concern and still ha file that be delete from the formerly important site rascal wa notable for store it file in macbinary format rather than the le efficient binhex format common at the other archive unles otherwise note shareware and freeware mention in thi document should be available at the above site to keep traffic on the internet manageable scandinavian should try connect to or instead those in the should look first at continental european can try and australian user should try to find what they want at which mirror info-mac and japanese user will find sumex mirror at a fourth very important site be thi be apple semi-official repository for system software developer tool source code technical note and other thing that come more or le straight from apple mouth some material at thi site may not be distribute outside the or by other site that do have an official license to distribute apple system software please read the variou readme document available at for the detail info if you connect from outside the or if you wish to redistribute material you find here can i get shareware by e-mail the info-mac archive at sumex-aim be available by e-mail from listserv alternately listserv the listserver respond to the command macarch help macarch index and macarch get filename mac archive file be available from mac send it a message contain the word help and index no quote on the first two line of ymy message for instruction on get start and a list of the file you may request you can retrieve file from other site by use the server at ftpmail for detail send it a message with just the text help no quote where can i find application x if you ca find what you look for at one of the above site try telnetting to ymy nearest archie server or send it an e-mail message address to archie with the subject help archie server be locate at america the original archie server in canada australium scandinavium and the and the continent these site index the ten of thousand of file available for anonymou ftp login a archie no password be need and type prog filename to find what you look for or type help for more detail instruction for instance you would type prog disinfectant to search for a convenient ftp site for disinfectant if the initial search fail to turn up the file you want try variation on and substring of the name for instance if you do find disinfectant with prog disinfectant you might try prog disi instead substring search often hide the gold in a pile of dros to avoid many erroneou match add a hqx to the end of the substring prog disi hqx most mac software available on the net end in hqx but almost no unix or pc software do please check the above archive and archie personally before ask where you can find a particular piece of shareware if you follow the above advice you should almost never have to ask the net where to find a particular piece of software can someone mail me application x no nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from that wa corrupt or miss at ymy site please refer to the first question in thi section to find out about anonymou ftp archie and automatic e-mail server what is bin hqx cpt etc most file available by ftp be modify twice to allow them to more easily pa through foreign computer system first they compress to make them faster to download and then they translate to either a binhex hqx or macbinary bin format that other computer can digest the macintosh use a special two-fork file system that choke most other computer binhex file be ascius text file while macbinary file be pure binary datum that must alway be transfer use a binary protocol how a file ha be translate and compress for transmission be indicate by it suffix normally a file will have a name something like xxx indicate how it wa compress and yyy indicate how it wa translate to use a file you ftp and download to ymy mac you need to reverse the proces most file you get from the net require a two-step decode proces first change the binhex hqx or macbinary bin file to a double-clickable macintosh file then decompres it which program decode which file type be cover in the table below also note that most macintosh telecommunication program will automatically convert macbinary file to regular macintosh file a they be download suffix sit cpt hqx bin pit z image dd zip uu tar extractor stuffit x x x x x compact pro x x packit x uutool x maccompres x suntar x x x x binhex x binhex x diskdoubler x x unzip x diskcopy x macutil x x x x a few note on the decompressor stuffit be a family of product that use several different compression scheme the freeware stuffit expander will unstuff all of them version of stuffit earlier than stuffit stuffit classic unstuffit and stuffit deluxe and will not unstuff the increase number of file stuff by stuffit you need to get a more recent version of stuffit or stuffit expander stuffit lite and deluxe consistently make smaller archive than any other macintosh compression utility to allow maximum space for file on the variou ftp site and to keep net-bandwidth down please compres all file you send to anonymou ftp site with stuffit uutool maccompres and suntar handle the popular unix format of uuencode uu compres z and tar tar respectively the unix version be often more robust than the mac product so use them instead when that an option translator that allow stuffit lite to expand uuencoded and tar file be also available by anonymou ftp macutil be dik winter package of unix utility to decompres and debinhex file on a workstation before download them to a mac since unix store file differently than do the mac macutil create macbinary bin file which should be automatically convert on download it ca decompres everything in particular it ca decompres the new stuffit archive however if you need only one or two file out of an archive for instance if you want to read the readme to find out if a program do what you need it to do before you download all of it macutil be indispensable it can be find at sumex-aim in the directory a few note on the compression format bin these be macbinary file alway use a binary file transfer protocol when transfer them never ascius or text most file on the net be store a hqx instead only rascal store most of it file in bin format most communication program such a zterm and mackermit be capable of translate macbinary file on the fly a they download if they know in advance they be download macbinary file image thi format be normally use only for system software so that on-line user can download file that can easily be convert into exact copy of the installer floppy instead of use diskcopy to restore the image to floppy you can use steve christensen freeware utility mountimage to treat the image on ymy hard disk a actual floppy insert in a floppy drive mountimage ha a reputation for be buggy so you should have some blank floppy and a copy of diskcopy handy just in case sea x x sea file do merit a position in the above table because they self-extracting they may have be create with compact pro stuffit or even diskdoubler but all should be capable of decompress themself when double-clicked for some unknown reason alysi ha choose not to use thi industry standard designation for self-extracting archive create with their payware product superdisk and more disk space instead they append either x or x to self-extracting archive how can i get binhex stuffit etc by far the easiest way to get these program be to ask a human be to copy them onto a floppy for you if you at a university there absolutely no excuse for not find someone to give you a copy and if you anywhere le remote than mcmurdo sound chance be very good that someone at a computer center dealership or user group can provide you with a copy of stuffit once you have stuffit any version you do need binhex if you such a computer geek that the think of actually ask a live breathe human be instead of a computer terminal for something turn you into a quiver ma of protoplasmic jelly you can probably download a work copy of stuffit from a local bulletin board system if you have religiou objection to software get by any mean other than anonymou ftp then i suppose i mention that you can in fact ftp a work copy of stuffit though thi be by far the hardest way to get it ftp to and login type the word binary hit return type cd and hit return then get and hit return of course it alway possible that by the time you read thi stuffit expander will have be update and the name change so if thi fail look for something similar if you ftp straight onto ymy mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will produce a work copy of stuffit expander when double-clicked if you ftp to ymy mainframe or unix account first you still need to use a modem program to download it to ymy mac just make sure that the mac be receive in macbinary mode and the mainframe be send in binary mode if you need more detail on the last step consult the faq list for and the manual for both ymy mainframe and macintosh telecommunication software how can i get binhex stuffit etc from a pc you ca there be absolutely no way to get an executable macintosh file from an ftp site onto a pc and then onto ymy mac without some software obtain by mean other than anonymou ftp you must beg borrow or steal the necessary software such a binhex or stuffit lite from another person i realize thi may terrify those among you who have leave ymy parent basement since you get an apple ius in but eventually you go to need to link up with some human be other than ymy mother though i suppose if you thi much of a nerd you could send ymy mother out to get it for you while you gather ymy nerve for a venture into the strange and terrify world of daylight please do bother the net by ask thi question again there simply be no way to move executable macintosh program from a pc or other non-macintosh computer onto a mac without software that be not bundle with most mac troubleshooting what to do before posting when thing go wrong while the variou faq list cover a lot of specific problem there be far more problem that be cover here these be a few basic technique you should follow before ask for help you should probably also perform the ten-step preventative maintenance routine describe in section fmy especially rebuild the desktop and resize the system heap following these step may or may not solve ymy problem but it will at least make it easier for other to recommend solution to you identify the problem microsoft word be crash do say much what be you do when it crash can you repeat the action that lead to the crash the more information you provide about the action precede the crash the more likely it be someone can help you the more precisely you identify the problem and the action precede it step the easier it will be to tell if the follow step fix the problem for example sometime quarkxpres crash with a coprocessor not instal error be not nearly a helpful a quarkxpres crash when i link two text box on a master page when copy of those text box already contain text the former will leave you wonder whether the bug remain after a give step the latter let you go right to the problem and see if it still there or not read the read me file many company include a list of know incompatibility and bug in their read me file often these be document in the manual read any read me file to see if any of the problem sound familiar check for viruse run disinfectant or another anti-viral acros ymy disk viru infection be rarer than most person think but they do occur and they do cause all sort of weird problem when they do reinstall the application and all it support file for half a dozen reason external magnetic field improperly write software the alignment of the planet a file on a disk may not contain the datum it suppose to contain thi can cause all type of unexplained unusual behavior restoring from original master will normally fix thi reinstall the system software bit be even more likely to get twiddle in the system file than in the application and the effect can be just a disastrou see question for a detail procedure for perform a clean reinstall if the problem continue to occur after you take these step chance be you find either a conflict between ymy application and some other software or a genuine bug in the program so it time to isolate the problem you need to find the minimal system on which the problem will assert itself here be the basic step of isolate the cause of a system or application crash a run only one application at a time occasionally application do conflict with each other if the problem do not manifest itself without other application run simultaneously you can begin launch other application until you find the one that cause the crash b if you run system turn off multifinder if you run system allot a much memory to the application a you can afford sometime program just need more memory especially when perform complicate operation c if you run system turn off virtual memory and address there still an awful lot of system hostile software out there include some from company that really have no excuse can you say microsoft word boy and girl i know you could some of thi software only express it incompatibility when certain uncommon action be take d boot from a virgin system floppy if the problem disappear you likely have an init conflict you need to progressively remove extension until the problem vanish use a little common sense when choose the first extension to remove if the problem occur when you try to open a file remove any init that me with the standard file open procedure such a super boomerang first if the problem remain after the obviou candidate have be eliminate either remove the remain extension one at a time or if you have a lot of them perform a binary search by remove half of the extension at a time once the problem disappear add half of the most recently remove set back continue until you narrow the conflict down to one extension when you think you find the offend init restart with only that init enable just to make sure that it and it alone be indeed cause the problem contact technical support by now you should have a very good idea of when where and why the conflict occur if a tech support number be available for the software call it if you lucky the company will have a work around or fix available if not perhap they at least add the bug to their database of problem to be fix in the next release preventive maintenance you would drive ymy car mile without give it a tune-up a computer be no different regular tune-up avoid a lot of problem although there be mac mechanic who be happy to charge you or more for the equivalent of an oil change there no reason you ca change it yourself the follow nine-step program should be perform about every three month trash unneeded file many of the operation that follow will run faster and more smoothly the more free disk space there be to work with so spend a little time clean up ymy hard disk if you at all like me you find several megabyte worth of preference file for application you no longer have archive of software you dearchived shareware you try out and do like announcement for event that have come and go and many other file you no longer need if you run system you may also have several more megabyte in ymy trash can alone throw them away and empty the trash rethink ymy extension some macintosh attract init like a new suit attract rain seriously consider whether you actually need every extension in ymy collection if you do use the functionality of an extension at least every fifth time you boot up you probably better off not store it in ymy system folder where it only take up memory destabilize ymy system and slow down every startup for instance if you only read pc disk once a month there no need to keep accesspc load all the time cutting back on ymy extension habit can really help avoid crash rebuild the desktop the desktop hold all the information necessary to associate each file with the application that create it it let the system know what application should be launch when you open a give file and what icon it should display where depending on it size each application ha one or more representative in the desktop file a application and file move on and off ymy hard disk the desktop file can be become bloat and corrupt think of it a a congres for ymy mac every so often it necessary to throw the bum out and start with a clean slate fortunately it easier to rebuild the desktop than to defeat an incumbent one warn rebuild the desktop will erase all comment you store in the get info box under system maurice volaski freeware init commentkeeper will retain those comment acros a rebuild commentkeeper also work with system but only if apple desktop manager extension be also instal to rebuild the desktop restart ymy mac and a ymy extension finish load depres the command and option key you be present with a dialog box ask if you want to rebuild the desktop and warn you that thi could take a few minute click ok it will take more than a few minute the more file you have the longer it will take if you run system you may want to turn off multifinder before try to rebuild the desktop if you experience definite problem and not just do preventive maintenance you may want to use fifth generation freeware init desktop reset desktop reset completely delete the desktop file before rebuild it thu eliminate possibly corrupt datum structure zap the pram and reset the clock all mac from the original thin mac to the quadra contain a small amount of battery power ram to hold certain set that properly move with the cpu rather than with the disk such a which disk to boot from unfortunately thi parameter ram can become corrupt and cause unexplained crash to reset it under system hold down the command option p and r key while restart ymy mac under system hold down the command option and shift key while select the control panel from the apple menu click ye when ask if you want to zap the parameter ram since you erase almost all the set in the general control panel you should now reset them to whatever you want the one set that zap the pram do not erase be the date and time but since the internal clock in the macintosh be notoriously inaccurate you probably want to take thi opportunity to reset it anyway resize the system heap even after rethink their extension a per step two most person still have at least half a row of icon march acros the bottom of their screen every time they restart all these extension and most application too need space in a section of memory call the system heap if the system heap be big enough to comfortably accommodate all the program that want a piece of it they all start play king of the mountain on the system heap knock each other off to get bigger piece for themself and try to climb back on after they get knock off all thi fight amongst the program severely degrade system performance and almost inevitably crash the mac if you use system ymy macintosh will automatically resize the system heap a necessary but if you run system it important to set ymy system heap size large enough to manage all ymy extension and application by default thi size be set to way too small for most mac with any extension at all the system heap size be store in the normally non-editable boot block of every system disk bill steinberg freeware utility bootman not only let you resize ymy system heap but even check how much memory ymy heap be already use so it can tell how much need to be allocate if you run system get bootman use it and be amaze at how infrequently ymy macintosh crash reinstall the system software system file can become corrupt and fragment especially if you store lot of font and desk accessory inside them merely update the system software will often not fix system file corruption i recommend do a clean reinstall here how boot from the installer floppy of ymy system disk copy any non-standard font and desk accessory out of ymy system file into a temporary suitcase trash the system file on ymy hard disk also trash the finder multifinder da handler and all other standard apple extension like control panel and chooser these will all be replace in the new installation if you run or instal system move everything in the extension control panel and preference folder into the top level of the system folder rename the system folder any name other than system folder be fine double-click the installer script on ymy system disk then choose customize select the appropriate software for ymy model mac and printer you could do an easy install instead but that will only add a lot of extension and code you do need that waste ymy memory and disk space once installation be finish move everything from the temporary folder you create in step into the new system folder if you ask if you want to replace anything you forget to take something out in step you need to replace thing individually until you find the duplicate piece reinstall any font or da you remove in step reboot you should now have a clean defragmented system file that take up le memory and disk space and a much more stable system overall disk utility much like system file hard disk have datum structure that occasionally become corrupt affect performance and even cause datum los apple include disk first aid a simple utility for detect and repair hard disk problem with it system disk it also available for anonymou ftp from in the directory even if you have an earlier version you should get the latest version from and run it on all ymy hard disk several company have release payware disk utility that detect and repair considerably more problem than disk first aid though interestingly none of them detect and repair everything that disk first aid do the three most effective for general work be central point mactool deluxe fifth generation public utilite and symantec norton utility for the macintosh a department or work group should have all of these a well a disk first aid since none of them fix everything the other do for individual mactool street be about half the price of norton street or public utility street so feature and ease of use be roughly equal i recommend mactool all of these product occasionally encounter problem they ca fix when that happen it time to backup and reformat backing up thi be one part of preventative maintenance that should be do a lot more often than every three month the simplest back up be to merely copy all the file on ymy hard disk onto floppy or other removable medium if you keep ymy datum file separate from ymy application and support file then it easy to only back up those folder which change frequently nonetheles every three month you should do a complete backup of ymy hard disk a number of program be available to make back up easier apple include a very basic full backup application with system with the performa apple ship a new apple backup utility that can backup the entire disk or just the system folder onto floppy the previously mention norton utility for the mac and mactool deluxe include more powerful floppy backup utility that incorporate compression and incremental backup finally if you lucky enough to have a tape drive network server or removable medium device to use for backup you should check out the more powerful payware utility redux street do support tape drife and diskfit pro street there be no freely available backup utility other than the old hd backup from system disk defragmentation a disk fill up it get harder and harder to find enough free space in the same place to write large file therefore the operate system will often split larger file into piece to be store in different place on ymy hard disk a file become more and more fragment performance can degrade there be several way to defragment a hard disk the most tediou but cheapest method be to backup all ymy file erase the hard disk and you might a well reformat while you at it see question and restore all the file a number of payware utility include norton utility for the mac and mac tool deluxe can
