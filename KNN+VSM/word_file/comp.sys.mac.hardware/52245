from tthiel terry thiel subject re centri flaky scott jay scott write a rep at the dealer actually it a university order center so they do have any immediate financial interest tell me that they have be have lot of problem with their centri he do go into detail but mention problem with the floppy drive and intermittent problem with print file it sound to me like they be have both hardware problem and software compatibility problem with the machine he not recommend the centri to anybody he say to consider a centri or a iivx why he would recommend a iivx over an lciius i do know but that what he say so what do the net think did the dealer just get one flaky machine or do apple send the out the door too early is ymy work just great or be it buggy too my be work great i have hear of any problem sound to me like ymy dealer do know what he talk about it pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the centri on the basi of problem with one machine recommending the iivx over the lciius do make a lot of sense either if thi person be so convince the be buggy have they talk to apple about it or be they just assume it a problem with all of them terry
