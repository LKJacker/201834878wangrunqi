from guykuo guy kuo subject iisi clock poll result long thi poll wa conduct to help user decide whether or not to alter their iisi clock oscillator i have attempt to gather a many case history a possible to find some estimate of succes and risk the number of reply probably show how rare thi modification be but give the impression that succes rate may be higher than the previou estimate of machine be able to run at mhz when no add on board be present thi be not a scientific survey but it be the best we have to work with thank to all who contribute to thi poll issue speed mhz to mhz appear to be the norm for machine without add on card all report machine be able to use mhz a long a no add on card be present several apple nubu card be in use no machine with the nubu adapter wa able to go faster than mhz one wa even able to achieve mhz with the nubu adapter in place at speed of and mhz the startup sound be distort and hi density floppy disk problem have be report note unles specifically list below machine be not test with a higher speed clock to failure hence the mhz operational machine may well work at higher speed damage one user report pull out the plat of one pad thi wa repair and the machine be operational one other report pull the pin out of the original clock oscillator during desoldering there be one second hand report of a user put a gash in the motherboard with a slip solder iron no report of static discharge damage no report of high speed operation cause damage then again i also do have any report from user of defective parachute add on board compatibility appear to be a problem with apple nubu adapter several other add on board have be use with succes see case history heat sink virtually all modify machine have a heat sink instal these be often the style power transistor type some use epoxy some use a dab of heat sink compound with a dab of cyanoacrylate glue there wa also use of a clamp with a bolt through the hole in the motherboard case history all speed be the effective cpu speed of clock oscillator all report cpu version be mhz mhz operational ran for minute at mhz before crash no fpu or other add on card heatsinked cpu only on no damage during installation mhz operational without apple nubu adapter mhz top speed with apple nubu card instal heatsinked cpu only on no floppy problem no damage during installation mhz operational unable to boot at mhz heatsinked cpu only no floppy problem no damage during installation mhz operational work with the follow two configuration a realtech fpu adaptor card realtech cache card supermac pdqsi b supermac fpu adaptor card supermac video spigot supermac pdqsi mhz operational fuzzy startup sound problem with hi density disk mhz operational fuzzy startup sound heat sink on cpu and chip to right of cpu mhz operational occasional crash at mhz mhz operational using fpu rat at mhz without difficulty mhz operational pd adapter with a spectrum graphic card and a videospigot a fpu heat sink on cpu mhz operational mhz fail after several hour mhz operational only upgrade mhz operational tried mhz system wo start heat sink on cpu configured with realtech card supermac pdqsi realtech cache cpu on continuously no problem floppy work fine at mhz mhz operational heat sink on cpu mhz operational heat sink on cpu mhz operational heat sink on cpu mhz operational heat sink on cpu mhz operational heat sink on cpu on hour per day mhz operational heat sink on cpu cool fan no floppy problem at mhz mhz operational bombed soon after startup at mhz with nubu adapter mhz rat cpu ram n in slot on motherboard mhz operational heat sink add to cpu later no damage while unheatsinked apple nubu adapter with fpu instal mhz operational heat sink on cpu mhz operational heat sink on cpu mhz operational heat sink on cpu mhz operational heat sink on cpu guy kuo guykuo
