from rvenkate ravikuma venkateswar subject re how do they compare ray ray fischer write dhk dave kitabjian write i sure intel and motorola be compete neck-and-neck for crunch-power but for a give clock speed how do we rank the follow from to how about some number here some kind of benchmark if you want let me start it while you at it where will the follow fit into the list pentium powerpc fastest then pentium with the first version of the powerpc somewhere in the vicinity number pentium powerpc note thi be the alpha just for comparison and about clock speed do double the clock speed double the overall processor speed and fill in the below mhz mhz no computer speed be only partly dependent of speed memory system speed play a large role a do video system speed and speed a processor clock rate go up the speed of the memory system become the greatest factor in the overall system speed if you have a processor it can be read another word from memory every sure you can put all memory in ymy computer but it will cost time a much a the slower simm not in a clock-doubled system there be a double in performance but it be quite significant maybe about a increase in performance beside for wait state performance you need a cache anyway i mean who use a processor that run at the speed of simm note that thi memory speed correspond to a clock speed of mhz and roughly the be twice a fast at a give clock speed a be the number ray fischer conviction be more dangerou enemy of truth ray than ly friedrich nietzsche ravikumar venkateswar rvenkate a pun be a no bless form of whit
