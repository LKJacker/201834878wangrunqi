from tbower tyson s bower subject re the iisi re method for attach heat sink to processor go to radio shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound it come in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap at radio shack it catalog number it a mix of silicone and zinc oxide and conduct heat very well plu it tacky usually you would smear a bite between the chip and the sink and then bolt or clamp the sink down but if you do move ymy mac gravity and the stickines of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold thing in place just make sure you remember it in there in case you tilt ymy mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose you would want a loose piece of metal run around inside ymy mac
