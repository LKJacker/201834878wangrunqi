from mene rainer mene subject re quadra clock chip followup i have replace the osz to mhz yesterday and no truble at all my quadra now work at mhz stable for more than hour i have also try a mhz osz but after hmy my quadra die i be not sure what wa the reason for that but it be to risky to run it to fast most of ymy quadra should work at mhz without any problem but a safety tip do a backup from ymy harddisk befor you start to upgrade during my mhz test i damage my harddisk and have a hardtime to get it work again so once again do a backup befor you start now the speedometer result after replace the osz speedometer report for mene rainer prepared april machine record version user comment quadra and ram disk mbyte ram mbyte vram system information computer mac quadra cpu fpu integral fpu mmu integral mmu color quickdraw bit qd system version finder version appletalk version laserwriter version laser prep version not found imagewriter version rom version rom size bit depth horizontal dpus vertical dpus primary screen size x physical ram logical ram result use mac classic a cpu graphic disk name of hard disk test ram disk math performance rating pr benchmark result use mac classic a kwhetstone dhrystone tower quicksort bubble sort queen puzzle permutation fast fourier matrix multiply integer matrix multiply sieve benchmark average fpu test use mac ius a ffpu fast fourier fpu kwhetstone fpu matrix mult fpu test average color test use mac ius a black white color color color color test average very interest be the graphic result graphic could belief thi but it be true two point which my cause problem be the mbyte ram solder on the board the be only ram and run at the upperlimit with mhz the next part which may cause trouble be the video ram i have the orignal vram from apple in my quadra here you be also at the upperlimit where most of the chip run but it be garantied to run most of the other part on the quadra board run on there o wn clockspeed so they wont make truble the most importaned question be do i neat a new heat sink i would say no after run my quadra for more than hour the heat sink be really cool a mhz with heat sink be mutch warmer than the in the quadra so i do see any problem the room temperatur wa celsiu f if you live in a area be it be hot f c and ymy room temperatur be not mutch below i would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side hope you will have the same succes than i have rainer email mene
