from mark rogowsky subject re powerpc rumination wa re lciius powerpc in article seanmcd write in article andrem andre molyneux write in article mirsky david joshua mirsky write hi i own an lciius and i recently hear an interest rumor i hear that the lciius ha a build in slot for a powerpc chip is thi true i hear that the slot be not the same a the pd slot is that true thank david mirsky mirsky well i also have an lc iius popping the top reveal one socket for an additional vram simm one socket for a ram simm one socket for a flat-pack fpu a processor-direct slot pd identical to the ius but with an additional set of connetion to one side for the full datum path that the ius lack that it i gues a board with a powerpc chip could be make that would fit in the pd but that the only place so will it be possible to have a nubu or pd powerpc upgrade or will it require a logic board swap it would be interest for apple to come out with a nubu powerpc that allow use of the cpu like rocketshare but i gues that get a bite fantastic i wa wonder since macweek report that developer be with powerpc on a nubu card also any word on machine arrival or estimate speed last i hear the estimate be around time the speed of a quadra in native risc mode i hear an apple employee mumble something about the arrival of powerpc machine at a much earlier date that but i doubt it true finally be the powerpc developer cd available i saw it advertise in the developer university calendar and i like to know if it at all interest sean seanmcd radiu speculate publicly that they could provide a powerpc-based rocket for exist mac it would have the plu of rocketshare and the minu of nubu accelerator no true boot off the accelerator nubu bottleneck to video and other apple it seem will not compete with third party here except perhap for not-yet-available mac like cyclone where a powerpc slot might be advertise look for daystar and such to make powerpc accelerator one potential problem with any accelerator though be that it will need a rom companion and apple ha license only radiu with rocketshare to use any of it proprietary code apple be between the line try to let u know that powerpc mac will have simplify logic board due to the magical nature of risc and that these board should be much cheaper to build than those in exist mac perhap then we see groundbreaking price in mac-logic board upgrade much the same way we see much cheaper high-performance cpu thi year first generation powerpc will also hopefully have socketed cpu so that they be chip upgradeable to a year later thi should be possible in much the same way that can be pull for clock doubler if there be too much technical baggage which i doubt since the external bus be the same to do thi perhap we can have cpu daughterboard a la powerbook a standard to facilitate better cpu upgrade thi be an area where apple ha fall far behing the intel-based world perhap catchup be in order by the way last week pc week have an excellent story on powerpc pentium mip dec alpha the big fmy on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future worth read for junkie also the latest pc ha a cover story on pentium read it and all the other story about how intel be unstoppable and preeminent right now once anyone be thi secure they be due to fall intel market position will never again be a dominant a it be today especially if amd get the go ahead to sell it thi week a it appear it might the competition from all front be gear up for an awesome battle apple user should be excite that powerpc while not guarantee dominance be a guarantee winner even if it one of several mark
