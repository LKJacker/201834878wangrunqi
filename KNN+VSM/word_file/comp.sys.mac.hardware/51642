from tom dicken subject re iisi clock upgrade i too have be watch the iisi speedup report and plan to upgrade in the next few week the plan i have be to build a small board with a few different crystal on it and to be able to switch between the different speed use a front pannel switch thi way i can get the speed when i want but i can also run at slower stock speed it i experience any compatability problem with any application i do expect to be able to switch clock speed with the system run but if i can switch without any lock-up problem then i could switch to when need and put it back to idle mhz when not needeed thi would further reduce the wear-and-tear on the cpu even with a heat sink of course i would not want to run the different clock signal through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desire and route it directly to the mother board i have start probe around inside my si yet do anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilator thank tom dicken boeing computer service these statement be mine and not boeing
