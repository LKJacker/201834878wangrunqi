from sukenick syg subject re ad conversion i be work a datum acquisition and analysi program to collect datum from insect sensory organ another alternative be the use of the sound input port can you really make due with the non-existent dynamic range of an converter of probably dubiou linearity and monotonicity and perhap ac-coupled a well it would depend on the requirement of the poster datum for some purpose resolution with or without calibration curve otherwise the other possibility would be get a digital voltameter with serial output connect to serial port on mac collect datum with some communication program buy an chip from analog device burr-brown etc connect to a parallel to serial converter use serial port for acquisition nah too much solder and trouble shoot get a board from national instrument datum translation omega etal the finest solution but possibly the most costly to the original poster if the signal be too large why not use a voltage divider two resistor cost very cheap george sukenick
