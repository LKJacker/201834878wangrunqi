from panlilio victor p panlilio subject re what thi thermal recalibration on quantum drife in article gary write whether the drive be hook up to the computer or not the make a disk seek noise every second thi be consistent and will continue a lomg a the drive be power up even if i disconnect the drive from the computer thi drive activity continue at second interval someone try to tell me the drive wa do a thermal recalibration not know bean about the internal physical work of the lastest disk drive technology i gues i might believe anything what the scoop on thi standalone drive activity every sec i can only comment on thermal recalibration in general some new drife perform it in order to increase overall integrity of datum write basically the firmware instruct the actuator to perform a test to see if the datum track be within a certain physical tolerance since when the medium heat up or cool down some track drift be inevitable and the drive ha to monitor it thi become especially critical at very high record density and so wa use primarily on very large-capacity mechanism but it seem to be find it way into more smaller drife a a way of boost the drive long-term reliability and mtbf rat i first become aware of thermal recalibration when it wa point out that the technique conflict with prolong write time when digitize say audio or video to hard disk some manufacturer explicitly state that drife with thermal recalibration be not to be use for application that have prolong disk write hope thi help victor
