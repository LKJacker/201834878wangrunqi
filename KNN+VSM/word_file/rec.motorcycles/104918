from egreen ed green pixel cruncher subject re please post in article mj mike sixsmith write all of u that argue about gyroscope etc throughly understand the technique of countersteering including all the one who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner well all the way through a decreasing-radiu corner anyway thi be really the only thing we disagree on maybe we should agree to disagree ok but i right the official line here though i do have my doubt about it be that the front brake be apply first follow by the rear brake the idea be that you avoid lock up the rear after weight transfer take place if that the official line teach in those rider education class you be refer to that also do teach countersteering i have to question the quality of the class the official line in msf curriculum be a i describe maximum brake be achieve by apply both brake equally when the weight distribution be nominally even and both tire have equal normal force and ease off on the rear to prevent lock it and increase brake on the front a more traction be available to the front due to increase normal force due to weight shift the official line you have be teach seem ineffective on the face of it applying the rear brake after the front be not take advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time and be halve the available brake power by use only the front at time saying brake until the tire just begin to slide be next to useles advice to a newbie he ha to go out and slide the tire to find out where that be it also gife him zero information from which to develop a brake technique that change a the brake and correspond weight shift develop if you do slide the tyre you have no way of know whether you achieve maximum brake or not i not suggest that you should alway aim to brake a hard a you possibly can but if you want to find the limit of the machine you have to go beyond them not necessarily true chirping the tire indicate impend lockup on most surface and serve a a good guide to newby to indicate maximum brake i agree that totally lock the front occasionally make one a better rider but it be a manuver best save for an experience rider unles you have one of those outrigger bike like code use to use in any case for maximum brake if a i suggest you aim to keep both wheel just on the point of slide then you be do exactly a you suggest true but from the point of view of how to best teach rid skill which be how thi discussion start keep both wheel just on the point of slide be nearly useles information you need to teach a technique or at least a strategy to achieve thi ed green former ninjaite i wa drink last night with a biker and i show him a picture of you i say dod go on get to know her you like her the grateful dead it seem like the least i could do
