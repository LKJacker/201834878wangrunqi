from thompson paul thompson subject re need advice for rid with someone on pillion rwert bob wert write are there traditional signal for slow down or go faster or i haftum go pee etc my experience be when they pound their fist on ymy back it mean slow down seriously concentrate on be very smooth and you will make her experience much more enjoyable even a normal upshift cause ymy passenger to bob so i ease off the throttle before pull in the clutch to eliminate thi it more work but ymy passenger will appreciate it also i find that use more rear brake than normal help keep the bike from dive a much during routine stop which make it much easier for the passenger to hang on if you go sport rid have the passenger reach around you and brace themself against the tank so you do have to bear both ymy weight with ymy arm again ymy bike will dive le too paul thompson apple computer
