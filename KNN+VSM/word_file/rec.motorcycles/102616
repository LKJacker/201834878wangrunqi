jorgenson dod updated stat ride info by ed green dod and other how do i get a dod number if the most frequently asked question in be what be the dod then the second most frequently asked question must be how do i get a dod number that be a simple a ask the keeper of the list kotl accept no substitue keeper for a number if you feel creative and ymy favorite number ha be take already you can make a request subject to kotl approval warning non-numeric non number request be likely to earn a flame from the kotl not that you wo get it but you will pay for it oh and just one little tiny suggestion ask the kotl in e-mail you just be play the lightning rod for flame if you post to the whole net and you look like a clueles newbie too by now you probably ask so who the kotl already well a john sloan note below that about the only real secret leave around here but a few un subtle hint can be divulge first it be not myself nor anyone mention by name in thi post maybe though john wa the original kotl second in keep with the true spirit of unix the kotl first name be only two letter long and can be spell entirely with hexadecimal character the kotl share hi name with a line orient text utility third he ha occasionally be see post message bestow new dod number mostly to bonehead with weenie mailer fourth there be reason to suspect the kotl of be a dead-head newsflash a message from the kotl once you have surmount thi intellectual pinnacle and electronically grovel to the kotl please keep in mind that the kotl do indeed work for a live and occasionally must pacify it bos by get something do ymy request may languish in mailer queue for gasp day perhap even horror a week or two during such time of economic activity on the part of the kotl employer send yet another copy of ymy request will not speed process of the queue it just make it longer verification of thi phenominon be leave a an excersize for the reader if you suspect mailer problem at least annotate subsequent request with an indication that a former request wa submit lest you be assign multiple number what you think the kotl memorize the list one more thing the kotl say that it telepathic power be what they use to be so provide some information for the list will ya the typical dod list entry contain number name e-mail addres for example ed green ca ps while john mention below that net acces and a bike be the only requirement for dod membership that not strictly true these day a there be a number of denizen who lack one or both blaine dance with biker gardner blgardne denizen of doom by bruce

corrosion control personality pun double entendre culture absence of culture first ride and friendship they argue with each other and plan ride together the difference between thi group and ymy local motorcycle club be that although they get together just about everyday most have never see each other face to face the member of thi group live all over the know world and communicate with each other electronically vium computer the computer range from laptop to multi-million dollar computer center the person range from college and university student to high-tech industry professional to public-acces electronic bulletin-board user currently pronounce wreck-dot-motorcycle it the file name for the group primary on-line meet place carry about article per month it be read by an estimate person most of the frequent poster belong to a motorcycle club the denizen of doom usually refer to a the dod the dod start when motorcyclist john r nickerson write a couple of parody design to poke fun at motorcycle stereotype fellow computer enthusiast bruce robinson post these article under the pen name denizen of doom a while later chuck roger sign off a dod nr keeper of the flame bruce wa then designate dod nr retroactively and of course nickerson the originator of the parody wa give dod nr the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meet and no rule appeal to many so john

from northern californium ride south rider from southern californium to ride north meet at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle an additional plan for be to hold an official denizen of doom homecoming in conjunction with the ama heritage homecoming in columbu ohio in july though it a safe bet the the denizen of doom and their collective communication hub will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organization for those who prowl the electronic pathway in search of two-wheeled camaraderie it a great way for kindred spirit to get together long may they flame live to flame flame to live centerbar thi official motto of the denizen of doom refer to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do anything like that face to face these insult be know a flame issue them be call flame flame often start when a member disagree with something another member ha post over the network a typical sophisticate intelligent form of calm reason rebuttal would be something like what an incredibly stupid statement you spandex-clad poseur thi will guarantee that five other person will reply in defense of the original poster describe just what they think of you ymy rid ability and ymy cat the denizen of doom the saga unfold by john sloan dod periodically the question what be dod be raise thi be one of those question in the same clas a why be the sky blue if there be a god why be there so much suffer in the world and why do woman inevitably tell you that you such a nice guy just before they dump you the kind of question steep in mysticism tradition and philosophy question that have inspire research and discussion by philosopher in locker room motorcycle service bay and in the hall of academe for generation a long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few minute be an eternity and the halt problem really be a problem on a computer far far away on the net topologically speak two machine in the same room in atlantum might route mail to one another vium a system in chicago a chap who wish to remain anonymou but who wa eventually assign the dod membership write a satire of the variou personality and flame war of and sign it the denizen of doom not wish to identify himself he ask that stalwart individual who would in the fullnes of time become dod to post it for him dod not really give a whit about what other person think and generally be a right think individual do so flaming and other amusement follow he who would become the holder of dod membership think thi wa the funniest thing he see in a while be the sort that be pretty easily amuse so he claim membership in the denizen of doom motorcycle club and start sign hi post with hi membership number perhap reader of be strike with the vision of a motorcycle club with no due no rule no restriction a to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organize electronically it may well be that reader be yearn to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole wa greater than the sum of it part it could also be that we all computer nerd who wear black sock and sneaker and pocket protector who just happen to also love take risk on machine with awesome power to weight ratio social outcast who saw a clique that would finally be open mind enough to accept u a member in a clear case of self fulfil prophesy the denizen of doom motorcycle club wa bear a club in which the majority of member have never meet one another face to face and perhap like it that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough give some of the electronic personality in the newsgroup a club organize and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteer through the network vium electronic news and mail with a list often use to organize group ride amongst member who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo album circulate around the country organize by dod club patch organize by and even an mtv-style music video produce by and distribute on vh by where will it end who know will the dod start sanction race place limit on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computer will the dod organize poker run where each participant collect a hand of hardware and software reference card will the dod have a rally in which the attendee demand a terminal room and at least a unix system only time will tell the dod ha no due no rule and no requirement other than net acces and a love for motorcycle to become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask be one of the few really good club secret new member will receive vium email a membership number and the latest copy of

movie top gun a few time too many rise to the occasion and reply that classify we could tell you but then we have to kill you and the rest be history a variation on the security theme be to supply disinformation about what dod stand for notable contribution and contributer where know include daughter of democracy dod doer of donut dancer of despair dod debaser of daughter dickweed of denver driveway of death debaucher of donut dumper of dirtbike note that thi be not a comprehensive list a variation appear to be limit only by the content of one imagination or dictionary file the archive first a bite of history thi all start with ilana stern and chuck roger organize a photo album many copy be make and several set be send on tour around the world only to vanish in unknown location then bruce tanner decide that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album bruce ha not only provide the disk space and ftp e-mail acces but he ha take the time to scan most of the photo that be available from the archive not only can you see what all these folk look like you can also gawk at their motorcycle a few non-photo file be available from the server too they include the dod membership list the dod yellow page the general faq and thi faq post here be a couple of excerpt from from message bruce post about how to use the archive vium ftp vium e-mail the addres be server the command be give in the body of the message the current command be dir and send give one per line the argument to the command be vm style file specification for the file spec be dod file for example you can send dir dod send dod send dod and you get back mail message a directory list uuencoded part of and the file in ascius oh wildcard be allow but a maximum of mail message round up to the next whole file be send a dod gif would send file of each not a good idea bruce tanner x tanner cerrito college norwalk ca cerrito tanner a couple of comment bruce ha put quite a bite of effort into thi so why not drop him a note if you find the archive useful second since bruce ha provide the server a a favor it would be kind of you to acces it after normal work hour californium time patch what patch you may have hear mention of variou dod trinket such a patch pin and ymy reaction wa probably i want or that sick or perhap that sick i want well there some good news and some bad news the good news be that there be an amaze variety of dod-labeled widget create the bad news be that there be anywhere you can buy any of them thi be because of any exclusivity attempt but
