from gruncie gillian e runcie subject re how to act in front of traffic jerk be a mere female i have often find i ca really take the big offensive line with asshole car driver so i find a more subtle and nastly ooop i mean nasty way to get back at them if somebody cut you up just wait till they have pull out past you and then gently lean over and bend their aerial every time i have do that it ha eventually snap off near the base which tend to go undetected for a while and be a bummer to replace gillian
