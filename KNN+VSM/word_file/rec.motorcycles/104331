from sturge richard sturge subject re rejetting carb now i be jump into the middle of thi thread so i may not know what be talk about but i have a few comment in davet dave tharp cd write unles an engine be supercharge the pressure available to force air into the intake tract be atmospheric at the time the intake valve be open the pressure differential available to move air be only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure leave over after the exhaust stroke and atmospheric a the piston decend on the intake stroke combustion chamber pressure be decrease allow atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract at no time do the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good vacuum there be a number of other factor that be very important the three biggest be air velocity air momentum and shock wave velocity stack have be use for year and be now be use inside of stock airbox on a number of bike at a tune engine rpm the stack can greatly increase the speed and thu momentum of the air rush in air momentum be critical in get good air intake the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force it way inside long after the piston ha begin it compressive up-stroke shock wave be use to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escape out the exzhaust port shock wave be the product of expansion chamber or any other mean of present a open or close to the air in motion beyond thi i be lose in the mystery of how they design for shock wave rich sturge h nswc carderock division w i speak for no one else and listen to the same
