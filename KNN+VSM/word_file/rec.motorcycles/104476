from mj mike sixsmith subject re please post leavitt mr bill write mj mike sixsmith write mj also imho tell newby about countersteering be er counter-productive mj co it just confuse them i ride around quite happily for year mj know nothing about countersteering i can not say i ride any differently mj now that i know about it i interpret thi to mean that you representative of every other motorcyclist in the world eh mike rather presumptive of you imho in my humble opinion leavitt mr bill write leavitt the time to learn countersteering technique be when you be first leavitt start to learn before you develop any bad habit i ride for leavitt five year before take my first course msf erc and learn leavitt about how to countersteer it now eight year later and i still leavitt have to consciously tell myself do steer countersteer old leavitt habit die hard and bad habit even harder mj sorry bill but thi be complete bollock you learn how to countersteer mj the first time you ride the bike it natural and intuitive sorry mike i not go to kick over the can you not countersteer over stone that one be kick around enough for the sake of argument i concede that it countersteering sake of argument only mj msf do not teach you how to countersteer it only tell you what mj you be already do and there no value in that i do say there wa no value all i say wa that it be very confuse to newby there a big difference in know what happen and how to make it do it especially in the extreme case of an emergency swerve and just let the bike do whatever it do to make itself turn once i know precisely what wa happen and how to make it do it abruptly and on command my emergency avoidance ability improve tenfold not to mention a big improvement in my normal corner ability i be much more proficient know how to countersteer the motorcycle rather than let the motorcycle steer itself that be when i remember to take cognitive command of the bike rather than let it run itself through the corner whereupon i return to my original comment better to learn what happen right from the start and how to take charge of it rather than develop the bad habit of merely go along for the ride bill you be kid yourself here firstly motorcycle do not steer themself only the rider can do that secondly it be the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry and the grind clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacle and not the knowledge of physic between the rider ear are you seriously suggest that countersteering knowledge enable you to corner faster or more competently than you could manage otherwise mike i extremely gratify for you that you have such a natural affinity and prowes for motorcycle that formal train wa a total waste of time for you assume ymy total train ha come from simply from read however of the motorcyclist i discuss formal rider education with have regard the experience a overwhelmingly positive thi regardles of the amount of experience they bring into the course range from minute to year formal train in thi country a far a i be aware do not include countersteering theory i find out about countersteering about six year ago from a physic lecturer who wa also a motorcyclist i do believe him at first when he say i steer my bike to the right to make it turn leave but i go out and analyse closely what i wa do and realize he wa right it an interest bite of knowledge and i have a lot of fun since then tell other about it who be at first a sceptical a i wa but that all it be an interest bite of knowledge and to claim that it be essential for all biker to know it or that you can corner faster or better a a result be absurd formal train be in my view absolutely essential if you go to be able to ride a bike properly and safely but by include countersteering theory in newbie course we be confuse person unnecessarily right at the time when there be far more important matter for them to learn and that wa my original point mike
