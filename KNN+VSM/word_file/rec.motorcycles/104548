from karr david karr subject re new to motorcycle in article gregh gregory humphrey write hello everyone i new to motorcycle so no flame please i do have my bike yet so i need a few piece of information any story on how you all learn i tell you my story a an example of what not to do early in i take some rid lesson from my college roommate on hi old honda he have take the msf beginner course so i actually learn some of what i need to know to ride i proceed to buy a beat-up honda for and a helmet and ride around wear thi and a cotton windbreaker then i decide to invest in a full-face helmet first smart move sometime around then i also pass my road test on may i get catch in a rainstorm on my way home from a trip entering the town where i live a rather urban suburb i have to stop suddenly for a red light that i notice too late skid the rear tire out and wa eject face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic fortunately for me the oncoming traffic wa also stop for the same red light otherwise i might have slide under a car and be kill now thi be anecdotal evidence to be sure but i later take the experienced rider course from the msf and saw that earlier train could have help me greatly in ymy case the need be even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff a i do so my advice be to take the msf beginner course first thing i would even buy a bike until you take the course unles you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you ready to use it i only have about to work with so that would have to cover everything bike helmet anything else that i too ignorant to know i need to buy while you wait to take the course it might take a few week in dc a i recall there be alway wait list in boston could you save up some more money to start out right say for rid gear plu the cost bike plu maybe gues to a mechanic to make sure the machine be safe assume you economize by buy some old beat-up machine from a private individual plu insurance plu registration and license fee plu the course you look at maybe not include the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance what be buy a bike go to do to my insurance i turn in about a month so my parent have be take care of my insurance up till now and i need a comprehensive list of cost that buy a motorcycle be go to insure i live in washington dc if that make a difference i pay about insurance now upstate ny but it wa closer to in boston more urban for decent insurance include substantial coverage for liability which you want unles you plan alway to be poor i gues dc be more like boston than like a rural area ergo more expensive any recommendation on what i should i should look for it there use to be annual buyer guide in the usual motorcycle magazine i find those helpful in get an idea of what new or recent model might be available you could probably look through past issue to size up what use bike might be available my first bike wa year old when i buy it so i go on my friend advice instead also look at the bike that you see person rid or that be park on the street i basically settle on my present bike by notice that there be a lot of high-mileage bmw run around and they be generally set up the way i want nothing wrong with talk to variou dealer in ymy area or visit showroom dealer in the boston area at least when i wa shop be very nice about let you look around their showroom and quote price for bike that be the latest model hence cheaper although i end up buy both bike in private sale david karr karr bmw dod also bmwmoa nra aclu et al
