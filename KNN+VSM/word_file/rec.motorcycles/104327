from davet dave tharp cd subject re rejetting carb in article jburney jeff burney write if we be only talk about i think i can understand exhaust pulse affect in a the intake valve be close on the exhaust stroke and the ga be push out by the cyclinder i gues there be some ga compression that may affect the amount push out but the limit factor seem to be the header pipe and not the canister meaning would gas so far down the line the canister really have an effect on the exhaust stroke do the gas really compres that much for discussion purpose i will ignore dynamic effect like pulse in the exhaust pipe and try to paint a useful mental picture unles an engine be supercharge the pressure available to force air into the intake tract be atmospheric at the time the intake valve be open the pressure differential available to move air be only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure leave over after the exhaust stroke and atmospheric a the piston decend on the intake stroke combustion chamber pressure be decrease allow atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract at no time do the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good vacuum at the time of the exhaust valve close the pressure in the combustion chamber be essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction the muffler note that the volume of ga that must flow through the exhaust be much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake because of the temperature difference and the product of combustion in the last year the japanese manufacturer have start pay attention to exhaust and intake tune in pursuit of almighty horsepower at thi point in time on high-performance bike substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance because the stock intake system flow very well anyway substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference unles in general the new exhaust system be much louder than the stocker on older bike exhaust back-pressure wa the dominate factor if free-flowing air filter be substitute very little difference wa note unles a free-flowing exhaust system wa instal a well in general an engine can be visualize a an air pump at any give rpm anything that will cause the engine to pump more air be it on the intake or exhaust side will cause it to produce more horsepower pumping more air will require recalibration rejetting of the carburetor dave tharp dod you ca wear out davet mra an indian scout indian chief ahrma or it brother the chief ama they build like rock nsu max to take the knock bmw compulsive it the harley that my employer ha no idea joiner give you grief
