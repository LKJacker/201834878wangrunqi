from galway deni mckeon subject re how to act in front of traffic jerk in article nielsmm niel mikkel michelsen write the other day it wa rain cat and dog therefor i wa go only to the speed limit on nothing more on my bike thi guy in hi bmw wa drive meter behind me for meter and at the next red light i calmly put the bike on it leg walk back to thi car he roll down the window and i tell him he wa a total idiot and the reason why did i do the right thing well i use to get mad and either try to communicate my anger to jerk or to uhm educate them in how to improve their manner in traffic now i just try to get them off my tail in heavy traffic i slow down a bite mostly so i have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind but i also often find that the jerk behind will notice traffic move faster in other lane switch into one of them and pa me which be fine because then i can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind while look ahead rather than from in front while split my attention between ahead and the mirror in traffic so heavy that there be no way for the jerk to pa i might pull over a if to look for a street number or name still ignore the jerk just to get the jerk off my tail if thi all sound well wimpy or un-denizenly or pessimistic or perhap for any psych type passive-aggressive consider that i prefer to get my adrenaline jolly from rid rather than from yell at jerk a ride can improve my whole day while yell at a jerk be likely for me to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger in the worst case yell at the jerk could ruin my life since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me be better arm with the cage than i be on a bike on the other hand you might try subtly arrange to be the last vehicle to legally cro one or more intersection leave the jerk wait for cro traffic and thu off ymy tail or cross illegally hopefully in front of the wait polouse like almost everything here ymy choice and mileage will vary deni mckeon galway
