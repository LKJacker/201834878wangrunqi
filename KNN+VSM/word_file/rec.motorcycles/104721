from jlevine jody levine subject re please post in article egreen write in article jlevine jody levine write in article egreen write single-track snow vehicle with front ski and snow ski attach to skier leg deform the surface of the snow create their own bank ice skate alter the phase of the ice and also carve out their own track so what so they have bugger all to do with motorcycle hence any apparent similarity in handle characteristic may or may not be analagou in it underlie physic to that behind motorcycle handle characteristic ok a one last attempt i take a different tack we all seem to be in agreement that there be two explanation for why one can use the handlebar to lean a move motorcycle the question be be one of the effect dominant and which one be it the idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristic and see which effect produce a similar result to the one with which those of u who have bike be familiar let look at the one that so far ha spark no controversy on it own gyroscopic precession to examine thi alone we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect by not allow the contact patch to transmit any force the wheel and steer mechanism would have to remain and be attach to a vehicle with about the same weight a a bike through suspension so that the wheel transmit force to the bike the same way similar to a bike an experiment would be to ride a bike along a dry road to get move and to get the wheel spin then change surface to something that wo transmit force through the contact patch and try a steer manoeuvre to see if the bike lean it probably would since some of u know how easy it be to fall down on ice but we would get a good idea of how well or what it feel like because without the contact patch we ca turn maybe there a better way beside even ice do get rid of the contact patch force altogether so we have to find a really frictionles surface you have to try it again with the wheel lock to really know if it wa the rotation that do it looking at the contact-patch effect only however be fairly simple now we have to find a vehicle that get the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch force a a motorcycle and transmit them about the same way to the vehicle but without rotate wheel how it get the contact patch force be irrelevant we just look for something that ha contact patch that can go straight and not sideway and ski or skate would do fine i do know of any snow-ski or skate bike but up here we have the suzuki wetbike that be arrange like a motorcycle but ha fat water ski where there should be wheel i think the propellor be in front of the rear ski or something like that but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of it effect now i admit that thi be second hand info although i love to try one of these but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sell them both say that thi machine handle very much like a motorcycle in that you countersteer it to turn so we have contact patch that transmit similar force to a bike a similar suspension arrangement and no gyroscope but we do have countersteering conclusion you do need gyroscope to countersteer vehicle that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangement we still do know what real effect the gyroscope have when they there but from my observation of how handlebar angle force etc relate to steer in general i will to bet that they not the dominant factor in countersteering if you do like thi conclusion then do accept it but my motorcycle behavimy be consistent with it if someone can prove otherwise go ahead i bike like jody levine dod kv get a you can if you pf ride it toronto ontario canada
