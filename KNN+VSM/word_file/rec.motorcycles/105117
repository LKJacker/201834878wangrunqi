from subject re countersteering to know or not to know what be the question in article mj mike sixsmith write lotto jerry lotto write the understand and ability to swerve wa essentially absent among the accident-involved rider in the hurt study the average rider do not identify that countersteering alone provide the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themself even after many year of practice i would agree entirely with these three paragraph but do the hurt study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure to swerve in most of the accident and near accident that i see rider will almost alway stand on the brake a hard a they dare simply because the instinct to brake in the face of danger be so strong that it over-ride everything else hard brake and swerve tend to be mutually exclusive manouvre do hurt draw any conclusion on which one be generally preferable apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger be a strong a the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger hurt find that a surprise number of accident-involved motorcyclist have use their brake at all prior to impact i think the only way you ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in a crisi be to make it the only consciou method of directional control you ever use and to practice it constantly even when you have no need to do any turn if you follow me down a long straight and i seem to be wiggle back and forth randomly or suddenly without obviou need it because i practice countersteering and avoid imaginary obstacle directly in my path all of thi practice may indeed be futile but if i have even millisecond to react the most familiar tactic available and hopefully the most automatic will be countersteering the same logic apply to brake with the front brake of course chuck roger
