from erick eric a kilpatrick subject re drinking and riding personally i follow the no alcohol rule when i on a bike my view be that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardou to my bike if i get hurt it my own fault but i do want to wreck my katana i develop thi philosophy from an impromptu experiment i have one beer at in the even and have volleyball practice at i wa even close to leagle intoxication but i could perform even the most basic thing until thi make me think about how i view alcohol and intoxication you may seem fine but ymy reaction may be affect such that you be unable to recover from hit a rock or even just a gust of wind i greatly enjoy social drink but for me it just do mix with rid max enjoyment eric
