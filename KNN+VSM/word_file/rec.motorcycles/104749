from mj mike sixsmith subject re x never need valve adjustment smead steve smead write i buy a yamaha with mile over the last year i put of commute mile onnit valve adjustment interval be suppossed to be every well every or so i check the pad clearence and they never change if anything the clearance seem to be get a little smaller which make no sense to me with the pad system the pad should wear until the clearance be too great right i know that thread adjuster can tighten up but i do think these kind could bottom line be that i have touch my valf for on thi bike and they be still nice and quiet and if anything the clearance be tighter what the deal any other yam triple owner notice extremely long valve adjustment interval yeah i have an that wa the same the valve seat tend to wear very slowly and anything that might get take off the pad which should really wear will tend to compensate so it a sort of self-compensating system
