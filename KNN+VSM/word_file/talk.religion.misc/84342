from mathew mathew subject moral relativism what if we all agree wa re after etc frank frank write in article mathew mathew write got it in one similarly a moral relativist will not judge one moral syste to be better than another in every possible circumstance thi do not however preclude him from judge one moral system to be better than anothe in a specific set of circumstance nor do it preclude a set of moral relativist from collectively judge a moral system from some set of circumstance which they all agree they be in thi make sense to me i seriou you explain something to me which i never understand before but just for grin suppose we almost all agree that we be in a set of circumstance call reality what then then we all live happily ever after seriously if we all agree on the circumstance we in i suspect we all agree on the best course of action unfortunately i have no confidence that such a situation will ever arise some of u think there a big god in the sky some do some think they be choose by god other disagree some think they be infallible other think otherwise until those disagreement over circumstance can be iron out there little hope of everyone agree or say for all practical intent and purpose there be no frame of reference in which thu and such be good be that approximately objective in the same way that we usually expect a speed bullet to outrun a snail ye i think that for example only a vanishingly small number of person would hold that there a frame of reference in which gas six million jew be good so that probably about a close to an objective moral value a i encounter in my life so far for example if we hear of a bomb in a crowd area be it a rather sensible first gues that thi be an immoral act even though there conceivably might be some tail-end case that would justify it well i think ymy example poor if the bomb in iraq for example and wa drop by an american plane many person would hold that it wa a moral act and what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if it be an objective reality for value i sorry i ca parse an objective reality for value could you tr y again objective reality for value be real even in the face of disagreement i still do quite see what you try to say i assume by value you mean moral value ye in which case what do you mean by real what be a real moral value a oppose to an unreal one i mean to say that value be a real a horse whatever you understand by a horse be real be pretty much what i mean about a value be real hmm so these moral value have a perceptible physical presence if you be say that some moral system be better than other in ymy opinion then all you get be infinite regres sorry but in what way be it an infinite regres it look extremely finite to me i mean that it never more than ymy opinion right and the chain end right there the buck stop with me it not an infinite regres you clarify thi for me above my understand be now that if a supermajority of relativist agree that thu and such be wrong in almost any or all frame of reference then they say something which be to all practical intent and purpose no different than what i say right the key point however be that there be vanishingly few of these moral issue where we can get of person to agree on the outcome for all frame of reference and agree on the frame of reference what you do not get be any justification for say that the moral system of the terrorist be inferior to that of the man of peace sorry but that not so i can provide a justification for assert that the moral system of the terrorist be inferior to that of the man of peace i just ca provide a justification which work in all possible circumstance logically possible or actually possible i ca manage either killing hitler use a car bomb would have be a terrorist act but i have to admit that i could exactly condemn it although there be tricky philosophical issue to do with hindsight by which i mean be you stretch possible to include event such a the atom in my terminal switch place so that the terminal turn upside down or do you think it likely that circumstance will arise in which terrorism be superior to peace i think that circumstance have already arise where terrorism would have be better than peace better in term of number of innocent person kill assuming it wa successful terrorism of course mathew
