from parker robert s parker subject re tieing abortion to health reform is clinton nut exuptr patrick taylor the sounding board write in article parker robert s parker write read the whole thing there some pretty hot stuff in here apparently you read the whole thing you continue to mi the point skinner gregg skinner write parker robert s parker write deletion soapbox on if it ok to pay for legal procedure with money then let get the government to pay for counsel that provide abortion alternative let get the government to pay for adoption fee let get the government to pay for all the thing that make abortion necessary why not they be certainly legal procedure counselling that only provide alternative to abortion would be just a bias a counsel that only provide abortion information how about provide counsel that will give a woman help in find what she be comfortable with ymy adoption-funding idea may be a good one any idea if it be feasable the only way hell be involve be that it be go to be a good ski resort before i give in to pay for abortion i believe it be wrong and i wo pay for it without a gripe i not for make them unlawful i rather spend money on save life than a bunch of investigation and court hear and all thi other crap we be spend my time on you know who really clean up on all thi abortion stuff lawyer i say let pa law to make adoption cheaper easier and infinitely more supportive of the birth mother let eradicate the stigma reduce the cost pay the price for life making adoption easier on the birth-mother may help reduce abortion but it will not eliminate the need for it abortion be not do just because the mother ca care for the child and do feel good about give it to stranger abortion be do because the mother can not afford the pregnancy soapbox off a person ha a right to do anything that do not interfere with the right of another person cool enough you have more trouble define the term in that statement than get person to agree to it for example i perceive i have a right not to participate in what i feel be murder i do think the government should either on the other hand since we be have trouble prove that it be murder there be no right to stop someone from do it if they so choose either by legal mean or harassment of course persuasion be allow but watch that line between persuasive and harass the second part be a definition of a person a simplistic explanation be that a person be a member of society most normal adult human be be good example of person most child over two year old be person a well the simple way of determine thi be that you can have a conversation with them it be actually more complicate than that but i have no desire to spend the time it would take to explain it to you read the thread why be bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and justification but why be ymy definition authoritative enough for the whoe u surely you can understand there be other definition with equal right of consideration then please justify why be human automatically make something valuable and why that include the unborn if the government refuse to fun abortion due to the qualm of a minority of the population then it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of baby whose mother want an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby will also require care for year true that need to be fix it be part of the problem if clinton ha a medical program to get underway let him addres thi too it be cheaper in the long run to save life later they will be productive member of society at least if hi plan work no they be not guarantee to become productive member of society even if they do that be many year in the future until which they be a burden on someone or society there be also the matter of the mother forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent her from be a productive member of society actually i wa refer to the minority that object to abortion not those who object to federal fund i admit i do not say it very clearly and apologize for that to refuse to fund abortion be to remove that choice from some woman and add the additional burden to society for no reason no thi be really flaw logic it would be like me say i wa bear with a disfigure face and i want cosmetic repair it be discriminatory that i can not make that choice and so you must pay for it that a person ha a right to make a choice do not imply legally or otherwise that someone else should foot the bill sic for that choice ok look it like thi we be foot the bill maybe they will take choice a maybe they will take choice b maybe they will take choice c they ca afford any one of them if they take choice a we have to pay them say if they take choice b it would cost u if they take choice c it will cost u now and a hell of a lot more for the next year which one sound the most realistic for u to be will to pay for now some person happen not to like choice a other person happen not to like choice c pay for it that be c ha be around and pay for for year even though it mean we spend a lot of money we ca in conscience refuse to pay for it now a ha be around and be perfectly legal but it ha be fund in the past now a be go to be fund but some person object they do like the idea of their tax money go to pay for choice a so we could refuse to fund a at all then those woman who ca afford any of those choice will be force to take choice b or c which will cost all of u more money most of u do see any reason at all why more money should be spend to the effect of remove personal choice from some woman the alternative be to fund a if that be what the mother choose we will also still fund b and even c if that be what the mother choose however some woman will certainly choose a and that will then save u we otherwise would have have to spend ymy taxe be not be raise to fund a choice you object they be be lower because we will fund a choice that be legal despite ymy objection to it actually ymy taxe be not really go to go down a i sure you would point out but the amount that be save in that area can help out in another like my massive debt if you disagree then give u some reason given that abortion be legal and the right to abortion be support by the majority of the population it be not justifiable to refuse abortion to woman who can not afford them who will simply require even greater fund for the delivery you would force upon them i refuse to pay more taxe to remove choice from those woman just because you object to a legal medical procedure what i say objection to the procedure be irrelevant uncle bill do pay for breast augmentation facelift etc why abortion it elective surgery those other procedure you mention only cost money there be no save in other procedure that would be require down the road without them in fact there could be additional cost down the road because of them thi be quite different from the case of abortion a for ymy argument you be entice a young girl to kill a baby by make it affordable and refuse to make the alternative affordable too so you are just a guilty of removing a choice by withholding fund think about it a poor girl be pregnant and abortion be federally fund what she gon na do what choice have ymy plan give her ymy kind of double talk really make me ill thi be bullshit we be not refuse to make the alternative affordable too if we refuse to pay for the more expensive choice of birth then ymy statement would make sense but that be not the case so it do if clinton try to block fund for pre-natal care and delivery or leave it out of hi health-care plan i would certainly object i would also be quite surprise pro-choice ha pro-abortion really fit in ymy case ye but probably not ymy definition of it or for the reason you think if you gon na fund one choice you have to fund them all at the very least you stupid fuck we do want to fund all the choice you be the one who want to not fund all the choice imho if we fund the adoption choice right mean not just throw money at it but cut cost esp legal cost we wo need abortion anymore ymy humble opinion be still wrong even with easy adoption there be still the fact that pregnancy take several month month in which a young woman could need to be get an education like finish high school enter college finish college get a job thing that be much harder to do if you have to take a break for a few month thing that have a massive impact on her future productivity have a right to life a fetu be not a person you can not have a conversation with them ah let kill the mentally incompetant a well or how about person we just do like since we ca have a conversation with them you can have a conversation with the mentally incompetant and even though you personally may refuse to have a conversation with person you just do like it be still possible for other to have a conversation with them it be not possible for anyone to have a conversation with a fetu they be not biologically independent nor wa my son at the age of week he wa breastfed and would not take a bottle just what do biologically independent mean i be happy to punch any definition full of loophole he wa still biologically independent at least to the same extent you be now he consume nutrient and digest them in the normal manner he breathe hi own air a fetu on the other hand get it nutrient already digest by the mother it get it oxygen from the mother a well that be not biologically independent their awarenes be questionable aha you admit it be questionable yet you be will to kill it even if it may be very aware i suggest you re-think ymy viewpoint awarenes be only part of what make a member of society it be the minimal conceivable requirement yet many person seem to think that something without awarenes could still be important enough to justify the suffereing of a true member of society i keep ask but i still have see a real justification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth the suffer of a sentient be i have read every response on the thread i be ask on yet so we see if i see one later they have no experience in the real world to make up a personality thi be also true of quite a few unix programmer so what d anyone who can program in unix ha a lot of experience in the real world rob
