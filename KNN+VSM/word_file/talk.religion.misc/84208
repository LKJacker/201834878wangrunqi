from trajan stephen mcintyre subject theist and objectivity can a theist be truly objective can he be impartial when question the truth of hi scripture or will he assume the superstition of hi parent when question i often find it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wonder about god and hi scripture i see it in the christian the jew the muslim and the other theist alike all assume that their mother and father be right in the aspect that a god exist and with that belief search for their god occasionally the theist may switch religion or aspect of the same religion but overall the majority keep to the belief that some creator wa behind the universe existence i know muslim who be once christian and vice versa i know christian who be once jewish and vice versa and i even know christian who become hindu yet throughout their transition from one faith to another they keep thi belief in some form of higher be why it usually all ha to do with how the child be bring up from the time he be bear the theist be bring up with the notion of the truth of some kind of scripture the bible the torah the etc he be tell of thi wondrou god who write or inspire the scripture of the prophet talk about in the scripture of the miracle perform etc he be also tell that to question thi a child be apt to do be a sin a crime against god and to lose belief in the scrip ture truth be to damn one soul to hell thu by the time he be able to read the scripture for himself the belief in it truth be so ingrain in hi mind it all seem a matter of course but it do stop there once the child be able to read for himself there be an endeavor to inculcate the child the right read of scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant read to glos over the worse one and to explain away the unexplainable with mystery circular argument self-evdent fact and truth unreasoning belief and fear of hell be the meat of religion the child must eat of every day to doubt of course mean wrath of some sort and the child must learn to put away hi brain when the matter concern god all of thi ha some considerable effect on the child so that when he become an adult the superstition he be teach be nearly impossible to remove all of thi lead me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when question god hell heaven the angel soul and all of the rest can he for a moment put aside thi notion that god do exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view obviously most theist can somewhat especially when present with mythical god homeric roman egyptian etc but can they put aside the assumption of god existence and question it impartially stephen atheist libertarian pro-individuality pro-responsibility jr and all that jazz
