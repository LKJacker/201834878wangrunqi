subject re ld rick reply from isscck robert weis psyrobtw write rick anderson reply to my letter with ra in article ra psyrobtw robert weis say ra just briefly on something that you mention in pass you refer to differ interpretation of create and say that many christian may not agree so what that be really irrelevant we do not base my faith on how many person think one way or another do we the bottom line be truth regardles of popularity of opinion it may be irrelevant to you and ymy personal belief or should i say bia but it be relevant to me and many other you right the bottom line is truth independant from you or anyone else since you proclaim truth a a self-proclaimed appointee may i ask you by what authority you do thi because it say so in the bible do the bible say so or be it you or someone else who interpret whether a scripture or doctrine conform to ymy particular like or disapproval excuse mous but ymy line of truth have move me one bite to persuade me that my belief be erroneou of all the preacher of truth on thi net you have strike me a a self-righteou member of the wreck crew with no positive message to me or other latter-day saint whatsoever btw thi entire discussion remind me a lot of the thing say by jesu to the pharisee ye hypocrite s ye preach about me with ymy lip but ymy heart be far remove from me also i find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create and eternally existent be equivalent you say grant the mormon belief you ca grant ymy conclusion and then expect the point to have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to addres and answer the point that wa raise and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant sophistry look who talk jump to conclusion you would do that yourself right all you addres be ymy own conviction regardles whether we come up with any biblical scripture which support my point of view because you reject such interpretation without any consideration whatsoever the bible state that lucifer wa create the bible state that jesu be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the ld belief be that jesu and lucifer be the same a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of ld doctrine the former kgb would have love to employ you jesu and lucifer be not the same silly and you know it the mormon belief be that all be child of god literally there be nothing symbolic about it thi however contradict what the bible say the bible teach that not everyone be a child of god correction it may contradict would you think the bible say the bible indeed do teach that not all be child of god in the sense that they belong to or follow god in hi footstep satan and hi follower have rebel against god and be not child of god but it do mean that they be not once create by god but choose to separate themself from those who choose to follow god and hi plan of salvation the field be the world the good seed be the child of the kingdom but the tare be the child of the wicked one matthew so thi illustrate nicely what i just say the child of the kingdom be those who have remain valiant in their testimony of jesu and have show work of repentance etc and the child of the wicked one be those who rebel against god and the lamb the issue of satan spirit-offspring and those who follow him ha not be address in thi and other verse you copy from ymy bible you purposefully obscure the subject by swamp ymy right with non relate scripture lot of nice scripture delete not robert w copyright though ra we be tell that and thi be life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesu christ whom thou hast send ra john life eternal be to know the only true god yet the ra doctrine of the ld that i have mention portray a vastly ra different jesu a jesu that can not be reconcile with the jesu of ra the bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim correction my jesu be indeed different than ymy jesu and can be reconcile with the jesu in the bible not ymy interpretation of him i concur but i honestly could care le ra one a be true deny the other from be true according to the ra bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination in thi single post of your i see more construct of imagination than in all of the pro-ld mail combine i have read so far in thi news group first get ymy lds-fact straight before you dare preach to u about the only true god whom you interpret accord to ymy own like and dislike but whose image i can not reconcile with what i know about him myself i gues ymy grandiose self-image do not allow for other faith believe in the divinity of jesu christ but in a different way or fashion than ymy own not that it really matter the mission and progress of the ld church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progress until it ha visit every continent sweep every clime and sound in every ear thi be really a red herring it do addres any issue raise but rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read something into the bible do change what the bible teach sigh what the bible teach or what the bible teach accord to robert weis and co i respect the former i reject the latter without the remotest feel that i have reject jesu on the contrary and by the way i do respect ymy interpretation of the bible i even grant you be a christian follow ymy own image of him a much a i be a christian follow my own image of him in my heart most of the other reply have instead hop-scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether hi view be doctrine i do think that it matter if mcconkie view be canon that be not the issue were mcconkie write indicative of mormon belief on thi subject be the real issue the indication from rick be that they may certainly be the issue be of course that you love to use anything to either mi represent or ridicule the ld church the issue of official doctrine be obviously very important mcconkie view have be controversial the seven deadly heresy ha make me a heretic at best or erroneou at worst black not to receive the priesthood in thi dispensation i respect him a someone who ha make hi valuable contribution to the church but i personally do not rely on hi personal interpretation hi book mormon doctrine be oftentime refer to a mcconkie bible in mormon circle on mormon doctrine i rather look to official doctrinal source and to hugh nibley book the last comment be an lds-insider reference summarizing mcconkie wa a wise man who contribute undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of god than i have but whose view be by no mean dogma or accept doctrine some of it clearly belong to personal interpretation and speculation but have say thi i find mcconkie even in hi most bias and speculative moment far more thought-provoking than the trash come from ymy proverbial pen i somewhat appal that i have allow myself to sink a low
