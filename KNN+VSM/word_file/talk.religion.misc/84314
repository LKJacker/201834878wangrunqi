from pharvey paul harvey subject daniel v zoroaster wa the jewish discomfort with jesu in article bill carlson write since everywhere i look zoroaster be suggest a be a probable descendant of daniel suppose you prove he wa zoroaster be far older than daniel if anything one could claim that in a sense daniel be a descendant of zoroaster a daniel though be hebrew ha assimilate into zoroastrianism and ha successfully introduce the religion into the tanakh of judaism however the majority of the book be in hellenistic aramaic not babylonian aramaic and only ha kethuvim or writing statu ref encyclopedium of religion mircea eliade daniel or in hebrew hero of the biblical book that bear hi name daniel be present a a jew in the babylonian exile who achieve notoriety in the royal court for hi dream interpretation and cryptography and for hi salvation from death in a lion pit he also appear in the last chapter of the book a the revealer of divine mystery and of the timetable of israel restoration to national-religiou autonomy a a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court describe in daniel write in the third person daniel per form hi interpretation alone while a a visionary-apocalyptist in daniel write in the first person he be in need of an angel to help him decode hi vision and mystery of the future it be likely that the name daniel be pseudonymou a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteou man know from ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition ez the authorship of the book be complicate not only by the diverse narrative voice and content but by it language daniel and be write in hebrew wherea daniel be in aramaic the language division parallel the subject division daniel concern legend and dream interpretation concern apocalyptic vision and interpretation of older prophecy the overall chronological scheme a well a internal thematic balance daniel be chiliastically relate suggest an attempt at redactional unity after the prefatory tale emphasize the life in court and the loyalty of daniel and some youth to their ancestral religion a chronological order be discernable a sequence from king nebuchadrezzar to dariu be report dn much of thi royal date and even some of the tale be problematic for example daniel speak of nebuchadrezzar transformation into a beast a story that be report in the qumran scroll of nabonidu belshazzar be portray a the last king of babylon although he wa never king and dariu be call a mede who conquer babylon and be place before cyru ius of persium although no such dariu be know the mede follow the persian and dariu be the name of several persian king presumably the episode of daniel depict a series of monarchical reversal episode of ritual observance and report of miraculou deliverance be collect in the seleucid period late fourth to mid-second century bce in order to reinvigorate wan jewish hope in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith the vision of daniel report event from the reign of belshazzar to that of cyru ius but actually predict the overthrow of seleucid rule in palestine be collect and publish during the reign of antiochu iv prior to the maccabean revolt for it wa then begin in bce that the jew be put to the test concern their allegiance to judaism and their ancestral tradition and many refuse to desecrate the statue of mosis and endure a martyr death for their resolute trust in divine dominion all of the vision of daniel dramatize thi dominion in different way for example vium image of the enthronement of a god of judgment with a son of man invest with rule thi figure wa interpret by jew a michael the archangel and by christian a christ in chapter vium zodiacal image of cosmic beast with bizarre manifestation a in chapter or vium complex reinterpretation of ancient prophecy especially those of jeremiah a find in daniel the imagery of the fmy beast in chapter parallel by the image of fmy metal in chapter represent fmy kingdom to be overthrow by a fifth monarchy of divine origin be one of the endure image of the book it sur vived a a prototype of jewish and christian historical and apocalyptic scheme to the end of the middle age the role and power of thi imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete isaac abravanel the scientist isaac newton and the philosopher jean bodin and among the fifth monarchy man of seventeenth century england for example be abide testimony to the use of thi ancient topo in organize the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinker and group the schema be still use to thi day by variou group predict the apocalyptic advent the encouragement in the face of religiou persecution that be find and propagandize in daniel contain a remarkable reinterpretation of isaiah regard the suffer servant of god not a all israel but a the select faithful neither the open story about daniel and the youth nor the final martyrological allusion advocate violence or revolt they rather advocate a stance of piety civil disobedience and trustful resignation victory for the faithful be in the hand of the archangel michael and the martyr will be resurrect and grant astral immortality persumably the circle behind the book be not the same a the maccabean fighter and may reflect some proto-pharisaic group of hasid or pietist the theme of resistance to oppression freedom of worship preservation of monotheistic integrity the overthrow of historical dominion and the acknowledgement of the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have serve a a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hmy zarathushtra founder of the religion know a zoroastrianism or mazdaism from mazda or ahura mazda the name of the god prophesy by zarathushtra the etymology and history of zarathushtra the avestan and oldest form of the name a uncertain both in variou iranian language and in relate form else where there may have be an old persian form zara-ushtra from which the greek form zoroastre may be derive and there may have exist an old iranian form zarat-ushtra to which may be link the middle iranian zrdrwsht several middle persian form such a zrtwsht and the new persian zardusht we can state with certainty only that the second half of the name ushtra mean camel the form zoroaster derive from the greek zoroastre wa use traditionally in european culture until the eighteenth century when zarathustra closer to the original and a find in nietzsche come into common use after the rediscovery of the avestum the collection of sacred book of zoroastrianism and the result study in iranian philology see avestum notwithstanding the great and continue popularity of zarathushtra even in western culture the source available to u be few extremely fragment and heterogeneou my principle source be the five gatha song attribute to zarathushtra himself and include in the yasna section of the avestum gatha ahunavaitus yasna gatha ushtavaitus yasna gatha spentamainyu yasna gatha vokukhshathra yasna and gatha vashishtoishtus yasna the last of which wa probably write after the prophet death other source of considerable albeit vary importance be the younger avestum and the remain zoroastrian religiou literature in particular the pahlavus text of the ninth and tenth centure ce although the achaemenid inscription sixth to fourth centure bce never mention zarathushtra he be mention by some greek source of the time not however by herodotu who seem unaware of him the avestum do not provide any direct or explicit datum concern the true chronological history of zarathushtra but the text be useful in an indirect way a it clearly imply that the environment in which zoroastrianism arise wa not that of iran under the mede or the persian the greek source on the other hand do provide some information concern the time of zarathushtra although from a historical point of view they be unreliable some place him six thousand year before the trojan war xanthu of lydium eudoxu of cnidu hermippu hermodoru aristotle plutarch diogene laertiu and pliny the account by xanthu of lydium however ha also be interpret by some to mean six hundred rather than six thousand year before the expedition of xerx against greece thi interpretation be favor by diogene laertiu who make reference to xanthu but although a few scholar a s shabazi helmut humbach have recently attempt to rehabilitate it under variou pretext it be generally reject although the historical value of the greek source be negligible they be nonetheles important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmo have already be develop in iran by the achaemenid period a the above account would seem to demonstrate they also show that by thi time zarathushtra wa already see a an almost mythical figure one from an extremely distant past all of thi lead to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belong to a historical period contemporary with or even close to that of the achaemenid later zoroastrian source the pahlavus text do provide an absolute chrono logy for zarathushtra one that wa also accept by some arab author accord ing to these source zarathushtra live or year before alexander again scholar be divide on the validity of the chronology some view it a historically reliable while other believe that it be devoid of historical justification the most convince argument however seem to support the latter position the figure of year be accurate only on the surface because it represent in fact the more general one of which wa employ by sasanid propagandist to locate zarathushtra lifetime roughly around the begin of iranian domination for a number of reason connect with complex problem inherent in the iranian chronology there wa also a desire on the part of the sasanid propagandist to avoid any millenarian threat in thi context zarathushtra whom tradition place early in the ninth millennium after the begin of the cosmo convert vishtaspa at the age of forty-two and vishtaspa conversion wa view by some a the begin of the millennium thu explain the double date of and year before alexander given the unreliability of the few available source we be force to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basi of other element principally on the contention that zarathushtra must have live a few century before cyru the great cambysis and dariu a there be no mention in the avestum of the great political achievement that take place in western iran in the middle of the first millennium bce nor be there any mention of the history of that period which wa to lead iran to a position of such predominance at the same time for a number of reason go back much further in history would not be justify consequently the traditionally accept theory of place zara thushtra around the begin of the first millennium bce appear to be the most legitimate a to zarathushtra land of origin many scholar agree on the basi of valid argument that he must have come from eastern iran some have hold that he wa a mede largely because of a late iranian tradition link zarathushtra with azerbaijan but also because of linguistic reason base on the language of the avestum thi hypothesi however should be discard a we can suppose both on historical and linguistic grind that zarathushtra come from the east even though we do not know precisely from which region there be a considerable variety of opinion on thi particular matter include the improbable view that he come from chorasmium or present-day khorezm or from a wider chorasmian region reach a far a the oase of merv and herat most likely however zarathushtra land of origin be somewhere in the vast area stretch from the hindu kush mountain range to the more southern region of bactrium and arachosium modern qandahar a well a drangiana the area of lake helmand it would thu be locate in what be now afghanistan or in the border region of iran zarathushtra himself tell u that he belong to the priestly caste yasna he wa a zaotar cf sanskrit hotr that be a priest belong to a specific group connect with a school that produce very elaborate and learn religiou poetry even in the so-called younger avestum he be describe a an athravan yasht a more general term encompass the entire priestly caste to enter it he have undergo a long and rigid train which he use to lend dignity a in the gatha to the content of hi new message the product of a great and original ethical mind zarathushtra also belong to that venerable priestly tradition link indium to iran in another way by center hi teach on the praise of the ashavan or possessor of asha that be the one who a in the vedic rtavan seek truth and master it thu become ashavan in thi life almost an initiate and bless after death any good follower of such teach seek the vision of asha just a those chosing the right path in vedic indium aspire to the vision of the sun a manifestation of rtum behind these concept and thi language ly the great tradition of aryan mysticism that be of indo-iranian mysticism zarathushtra greatnes however do not lie in hi have belong to a particular religiou tradition rather it ly in the innovation and strength of hi message which wa in itself a break in the tradition one that force fully and effectively introduce two great revolutionary idea dualistic monotheism the wise lord who father two twin spirit the beneficent and the evil and the expectation of a transfiguration av frashokeretus pahl frashgird of life and existence see frashokeretus both hi monotheistic and dualistic idea and hi particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate zarathushtra teach from the indo-iranian tradi tion of hi upbringing they exemplify hi rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that do not provide adequate answer to the problem of evil because of hi basic tenet zarathushtra who advocate an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperative of tradi tion can be number among the greatest of religiou figure another original facet of zarathushtra message one that be not easy to understand but which however hold the key to a deeper understand of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the gatha be the doctrine of the amesha spenta the beneficent immortal these be spiritualization of the abstract notion of good think best truth desirable power bounteou devotion wholenes and immortality all of which operate accord to a system of interrelation and correlation and can simultaneously be the manifestation of a divinity and of human virtue see amesha spenta other than the name of hi father pourushaspa possess gray horse and of hi mother dughdova one who ha milk we know almost nothing of zarathushtra life a late pahlavus text also give the name of fmy brother according to tradition zarathushtra leave home at the age of twenty and at thirty he wa subject to a revelation both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision only after ten year have pass however do he succeed in convert a cousin of hi maidhyoimah to hi belief he wa strongly oppose in hi native land by kavi karapan and usij priestly group associate with traditional teach and practice thi hostility cause him to leave hi region yasna and to seek refuge at the court of kavus vishtaspa a ruler who have be convert to the new religion together with hi wife hutaosa when the prophet accord to tradition wa forty-two year old we also know the name of a son isat vastra desire pasture and of three daughter bear of hi first wife a well a the name of two more son urvatatnara command man and hvarecithra sun-faced bear of hi second wife hvovus a member of the influential hvogva possess good cattle family two other figure belong to the hvogva family be mention frashaoshtra and jamaspa the former a hvovus father and the latter a the husband of the third daughter of the prophet pouruchistum very thoughtful whose wed be celebrate in the fifth hymm in the gatha yasna again accord to tradition zarathushtra die at the age of seventy-seven he wa assassinate by a karapan a priest of the old religion who belong to the tuirya tribe and wa call tur i bradre hi name be know only in the pahlavus form the paucity of information on the prophet life be compensate by a tradi tion rich in legendary detail that arise through the century in zoroastrian community the main text document the tradition be the seventh book of the denkard a pahlavus work date from the ninth century ce a well a passage from other pahlavus text and a new persian work from the thirteenth century the zarathusht-nama book of zarathushtra write by zaratusht-i bahram-i pazhdu mythical and ritual element prevail in the later legend about zarathushtra which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man zarathushtra great popularity in the ancient world continue throughout the renaissance until the enlightenment during the classical and hellenistic period he wa view a a wise man a typical representative of an alien wisdom a master of the secret of heaven and earth a seer astrologer psychologist and wonder worker pythagorean thinker go so far a to see the influence of zarathushtra on pythagora himself and the academician alway openly admire the persian thinker who found the school of the magi and advocate a doctrine of dualism earliest christianity view zarathushtra a a precursor of the christian faith one who not only prophesy a have the biblical prophet the advent of the messiah but also predict the supernatural sign of hi come the star that wa to appear in the east and guide the three magi to the manger in bethlehem see magi thi christian interpretation be derive from the zoroastrian doctrine of the saoshyant the savior of the future see saoshyant later however religiou struggle arise during the sasanid empire in persium third to seventh century ce which link the spread of christianity with the roman empire zarathushtra popularity in the christian world begin to decline the iranian prophet who have be praise often by the gnostic school and who have be see by mani a one of the three great messenger from the past wa now see instead a a leader of imposture and heresy a teacher of the diabolic art of witchery but during the renais ance and the enlightenment european culture revert to the image of zara thushtra that have come down through classical and hellenistic antiquity he wa view once again a a great and wise man a the author of the chaldean oracle and probably inventor of qabbalah a a teacher of astrology a a possible bridge between christianity and platonism and at time a in voltaire a a symbol of non-christian wisdom after western philology rediscover zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth century friedrich nietzsche in an intentional paradox give the name zarathustra to the hero of hi work also sprach zarathustra nietzsche saw the iranian prophet a the first to have discover the true motive force underlie all thing that be the eternal struggle between good and evil
