from keith keith allan schneider subject re the universe and black hole wa re year salem bruce salem write is thi zeno paradox no zeno paradox be resolve by show that integration or an infinite series of decrease term can sum to a finite result nothing can get out of a black hole because the escape velocity be the speed of light i do know how time dialation can prevent matter spiral in from get to the event horizon can any one explain how matter get in well suppose a probe emit radiation at a constant frequency wa send toward a black hole a it get closer to the event horizon the red shift would keep increase the period would get longer and longer but it would never stop an observer would not observe the probe actually reach the event horizon the detect energy from the probe would keep decrease but it would vanish exp t never quite reach zero i gues the above probably do make thing any more clear but hopefully you will get the general idea maybe keith
