from rcander mr nice guy subject no-knock wa re who next mormon and jew isaackuo isaac kuo state in reply to delete article about no-knock search arrest hmm the polouse strategy of burst in with weapon draw clearly mark a officer and yell polouse repeatedly thi be use every day to bust drug house the idea be to awe the suspect into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight a for not knock it a sad necessity in many case since the suspect will attempt to escape or even fight usually thi strategy work if it do then it would be use so commonly now would it in general no-knock raid be to preserve evidence like drug which can be flush down the toilet they be not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber if there be no need to search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwell and order the suspect to come out with her hand up if the suspect do not come out tear ga will be use comment on the bd omit i merely point out that it is a valid strategy which be use every day furthermore we do know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehend potentially dangerou and arm suspect do you suggest it be not a method to apprehend criminal that the polouse alway knock with gun holstered and never arrest any suspect until they have be allow to inspect the officer badge just what should the polouse do when apprehend potentially dangerou and arm suspect how far can they reasonably go to identity themself what do you suggest they can do which ca be fake by the competition it be a very dangerou method to obtain evidence that might be destroy if a warrant be serve in the normal way it be the most dangerou way to arrest anyone the cop be charge into a room and they do know what be in it it be much safer to surround the place and announce yourself even if you get deadly enemy who may pretend to be cop that not an excuse to murder polouse in the case of the bd there wa almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimy who would pretend to be cop cop be not cop until they identify themself a polouse officer most drug dealer and professional criminal be aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system work if they be arrest they call their lawyer post bail and hope for a plea bargain if they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charge with first degree murder if they survive the raid drug dealer have gun for protection from their customer and other criminal not to shoot cop cop be shoot on no-knock drug raid because the criminal be aware that they be cop no-knock raid on home occupy by non-criminal be more likely to end in disaster mom and pop citizen know that they have not commit any crime they know that anyone break into their house can not be a cop because they have do nothing wrong if they have the mean to defend themself they may because they know that the housebreaker be criminal not cop cop and homeowner may die the first report from waco state that the atf have a warrant to search for illegal weapon and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapon be find in thi case the no-knock warrant wa not call for it be difficult to flush a gun down the toilet the atf could have surround the compound a mark polouse car could have drive up to the entrance and uniform officer could have knock and serve the warrant usual way it thi have happen and and koresh refuse the warrant or drive the cop off at gun point then most of the folk would have keep quiet rod anderson i do not think the united state government boulder co be responsible for the fact that a bunch of rcander fanatic decide to kill themself satellite on slick willie the compassionate
