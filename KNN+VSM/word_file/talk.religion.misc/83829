from bskendig brian kendig subject re is it good that jesu die brian brian ceccarelli write bskendig brian kendig write and i maintain some person do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone be their own master because they fear it they be too afraid of have to face the world on their own term are you ymy own master do you have any habit that you can not break if i have a habit that i really want to break and i be will to make whatever sacrifice i need to make to break it then i do so there have be bad habit of mine that i decide to put forth the effort to break and i do so there have be other bad habit that i decide be not worth the effort to break it my choice either way i be my own master i choose what i want to do i weigh the benefit of my action against their consequence and i use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected which in turn make me more experience i do alway succeed but i never fail either i learn do you have any habit you ca break why not for one you seem unable to master ymy lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the bible i have arrive at my own understand of christianity just a you probably arrive at ymy own understand of islam that be most likely very different from the way a moslem think of hi religion are you unable to master ymy lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the quran if that different then how be it different from what you accuse me of can i accuse you of have no desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism how about sexual sin got tum any of those secret desire in ymy head that you harbor but can get control of do you dehumanize woman when they walk past you do you degrade them to a sex object in ymy head of course not that disgust for century religion have be discriminate on sex and treat woman a second-clas human that one of the reason i renounce my christianity do you insult person unknowingly then regret it later yet do it again the next time opportunity present itself no i do insult person period it not in my nature and it not something that i want to do either are you truly the master of yourself not yet but my life be the grind i use to practice on the fun be in the get there i have admit that i be not the master of my think life at all time that i sometime say thing i do want to say and then repeat my mistake unwantingly i have admit to myself that i can not control every aspect of my be there be time i know i should say something but then say it anyway there be time i simply forget a lesson i in fact be not my own master we do start out perfect we get to strive to be something better i know my shortcoming and i know my strength and i live my life accord to the decision i make and i be content to abide with the consequence of my decision a easily a i accept the praise for them there have be time in my life when i make mistake ye i try to never make the same mistake twice i need help jesu promise me thi help and i take him up on hi offer i have willfully let jesu be my master because jesu know what be better for me than i myself do i regard christ a a myth i feel that there be far too many person offer far too many interpretation of what he supposedly say and do the only person who can really judge me be me i choose the road i travel and i decide whether or not i want to reach the end of any give road or turn back and a long a i do alway turn back there no shame in it when i need help i seek out my friend do you see my point i think you the one under the rock and i get a great tan out here in the sunlight my life ha improve immesurably since i abandon theism come and join me it will be a difficult trip at first until you build up ymy muscle for the long hike but it well worth it then i gues ignorance be blis for you because brian you enjoy not have a clue about the bible and you do have a clue about what i say either open ymy eye and see open ymy ear and listen i not just spout off empty word thi be my life thi be what gife me meaning do you see i not go to accept anything that i ca witnes with my own eye or experience with my own sense especially not something a mega-powerful a what you try to get me to accept surely if you believe in it thi strongly you must have a good reason to do you can you witnes motherly love with ymy sense how do care and concern for you register with ymy sense if nothing register to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become a vulcan and fast you better get rid of ymy emotion huh you go way off the track here i say my mother love me how do i know you ask i can point to definite thing she do for me and i can even just bring her to you so you can ask her face-to-face you say ymy deity love you how do you know i ask you ca even convince me that it exist my god say that you will not cease existing you have life forever you can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there be no communication whatsoever or can choose to live it in paradise with god that be what my god say and that wa the issue ymy made-up theism be what it be make up it wishful think if any god dangle before me like a carrot promise untold pleasure to me if i only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just thi once then i would choose i can not lie to myself to placate another be no matter how powerful it be note also that there be several god try to lure me thi way yahweh allah zeu odin ra please give me a solid reason to choose one of them over the other description of kendigism delete hee hee why would you want to live a good life to you you die and that it do contradict yourself you have no reason to live a good life it do do you any good in the end ymy life do do anybody else any good either because everyone dy anyway so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life be meaningles why do you do such a meaningles thing that paragraph demonstrate that you have listen to a single word i say have you ever go to an amusement park why i mean after a few hour it close and nothing different except that you a few dollar lighter going to the amusement park do do you any good at all why do you do such a meaningles thing the answer be that you think it fun you play the skee-ball over and over because you like to get better at it even though you not go to win anything better than a stuff animal even if you blow ten dollar on it you ride the roller coaster because it an thrill experience even though because it scare the dicken out of you in the same way i think life be fun and i do intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night d i sorry i do feel that sacrifice jesu wa something any god i worship would do unles the sacrifice wa only temporary in which case it not really all that important ha the resurrection sink in jesu be alive jesu be not dead so you and ymy holy book say by the same token therefore santum clau deliver toy every xma do you see i have no reason to believe that what you say be true please give me some reason that i ca similarly apply to santum clau forget the bible for a minute forget quote verse forget about who say what about thi or that show me picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop and convince me that you right forget that i be a person forget that i know how to type forget that i know how to put a sentence together forget that i know how to send e-mail forget my existence proove to me that i exist i ca do it because ymy existence mean nothing more to me than just ymy communication over the net you have no more bear on nor importance in my life than that remove it and you will cease to be significant to me are you thereby infer that ymy deity be nothing more than a collection of verse in a book and can not be support without invoke them or do you mean that the existence of ymy deity and in fact any other deity that can be write about be a real a ymy own existence why do you believe what you believe brian kendig je ne sui fait comme aucun bskendig de ceux que vu croire fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent the mean of life si je ne vaux pa mieux au moin je sui autre be that it end rousseau
