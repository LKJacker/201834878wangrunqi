subject re who next mormon and jew from isscck dan sorenson viking write in mcclary michael mcclary write just think i clear up a few of the murky area actually after survive be drive out of nauvoo and later carthage the mormon did fortify utah they still arm themself to defend the faith and stockpile food a well they have be involve in quite a lot of illegal activity include multiple and often underage wife for the leader a practice still in vogue with some splinter of their sect the parallel between koresh and joseph smith be strike by they you mean the leader of the ld church i grant you that when joseph smith wa still alive plenty of accusation be file most of which have little bear with reality a evidence by variou verdict i have study ld history for year now and i have yet to see prove that the ld leadership wa involve in quote illegal activity plural marriage ye but ymy charge of underage wife sound like it could have originate from a tabloid and discredit the high moral standard which characterize these leader and family unlike a it appear those of david koresh joseph smith start the sect after he and hi brother hyram be murder in a nauvoo il jail cell church membership split over who to follow initially smith wa consider a prophet just like mohammed a rather interest parallel consider muslim consider christ to be a prophet the same a jew i lead to understand make no mistake thi wa no messiah we talk about in smith the and neither do he claim he wa a the church reflect the moral aptitude of it leader and especially those of joseph smith i have nothing but the highest respect for thi inspire man whose only crime wa that he refuse to deny that he have see a vision many have try to explain the smith phenomenon away but the bold presence of an million member strong church stand a a witnes that joseph smith testimony have enough resilience and power to carry on the message think at the time wa that the gift of prophecy wa to be hand down father to son after joseph smith die hi son wa only enter hi teen brigham young and a few other claim to have be bequeath the gift and leadership prior to hi death the council of twelve the church govern body wa of much help here and thi basic conflict be still a wedge between the sect brigham young take hi follower to salt lake the rest wait for smith jr to grow up enough to assume leadership the other claimant to the leadership be soon ignore like mike dukaki the rest be apostate and excommunicate member of the church while the great majority of the membership the twelve and the variou auxiliary organization choose to accept brigham young a the new prophet and leader of the church if you know ymy ld scripture and doctrine you would have know that brigham young wa the first in line to fill the prophet joseph smith vacancy he wa the senior apostle in the quorum and variou comment make by joseph indicate that it wa brigham who would lead the latter-day exodu to the west other rightful heir be either dead hyrum smith or excommunicate oliver cowdery and while persecution abound and intensify joseph smith have already give order to look for a new place an empty land beyond the boundary of the united state at that time thi rekhabite principle pseudographium wa well understand and antipated by the great majority of ld faithful and wa not question by them granted a couple of do-it-yourselfer stay behind unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilou journey to the unknown but thi also wa necessary to separate the tare from the wheat the church benefit from thi purification proces they become even more unify and will to carry out their mission to the world both sect practice the food stockpile doctrine and thi be frontier and farm country most carry or at least own weapon there be little evidence that they be a militaristic sect give that they tend to move on rather than face large-scale opposition brigham young have suffer a great deal get to salt lake seem to have be quite justify in make military train a good thing remember thi wa far beyond where even the u army go and these person have nobody to turn to save themself just a little context to put thi all in perspective btw since when be the church of jesu christ of latter-day saint one of the largest denomination in the country a sect it do splinter from any other religion a do say the southern baptist or methodist so what do the mormon get it seem that j edgar hoover wa very impress with the way they keep secret they pledge to defend secret with their life and atone for sin with blood many actually do even to the point of suicide what a balloney suicide be sinful and against the law of god i be not comfortable with thi allege cosine with mammon i assure you that many among u reject thi attitude categorically period my only true allegiance be to my god and to the leader which he ha appoint to represent him in any regard to read thi trash about suicide and atone for sin with blood be yet another insult misrepresentation of what my church believe in and stand for the rld the reorganized ld be friendly rival of the ld and delight in tell story about them which generate quick retort from the ld member and everybody ha a grand time at no time have i ever even hear thi hint at i take it with a salt block make it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top so he hire virtually no one but mormon until the fbi wa almost exclusively staff by member of the church of later day saint though j edgar be finally go the fbi personnel especially the field agent be still heavily mormon i have often wonder how thi might affect the fbi treatment of religiou organization a mormon would consider heretical preposterou even if thi be true reliable datum please i be convince that those officer would perform to the highest code of honor and conduct that why they be select for in the first place remember beside one of my article of faith strongly state the principle of freedom of religion and that all person be free to worship how where or what they may if it true there would be little affect ld and rld philosophy be that all other religion have stray from the true church a set down by jesu but that god will judge each on hi own merit in addition the rld also contend and the ld may a well that ignorance of the true way tm be an excuse you can only be condemn if you have be tought the way and reject it in short ld and rld suffer everybody from lutheran to buddhist secure in the knowledge that though they be wrong they will not be penalize for ignorance it be more likely that hoover like them because of their rather strict upbringing which forbid alcohol tobacco hot drink like coffee or tea and the like these person be the salt of the earth and a such be more easily make to follow order and have few vice to be use against them a good explanation i can accept that you be right that ld person be sometime a little too cosy with mammon order the late president kimball for example wa an exception with hi strong opposition of the selection of the mx peace keeper missile maze in utah that my somewhat educate gues anyway both sect have splinter group that do mirror the mass but these be small and rare and hardly worth note their common ancestry none of thi ha any relevance to gun though when a man religion be use to deny him the right of self-protection with the weapon suitable for the job he find an ally in me dan sorenson dod viking isu only censor what i read not what i say do blame them usenet post to exotic distant machine meet
