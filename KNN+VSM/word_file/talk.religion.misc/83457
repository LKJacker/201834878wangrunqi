from david david bold subject re question for those with popular morality in article jame owen write in a previou article david david bold say i do mean to be rude but i think that you get hold of the wrong end of a different stick david i have a look at ymy post again and i see what you mean i wa so intent on explain how jung think we could be more moral than god that i overlook ymy main line of think you seem to be say that god be unknowable hi morality be unknowable yep that pretty much it i not a jew but i understand that thi be the jewish way of think however the jew believe that the covenant between yhwh and the patriarch abraham and mosis in thi case establish a moral code to follow for mankind even the jew could not decide where the boundary fall though a i understand it the sadducee believe that the torah wa all that wa require wherea the pharisee the ancestor of modern judaism believe that the torah wa available for interpretation to lead to an understand of the require morality in all it nuance talmud the essence of all of thi be that biblical morality be an interface between man and yhwh for a jew or christian and do not necessarily indicate anything about yhwh outside of that relationship although one can speculate the first thing that come to mind be that man be suppose to be create in hi image so there be an argument that we be commit to whatever moral code he follow a part of try to live up to that image if we be suppose to live by christ example you would be hard press to argue that god be a do what i say not what i do kind of guy the trouble with all of thi be that we do really know what the create in hi image mean i hear a number of different opinion on thi and have still not come to any conclusion thi rather upset the apple cart if one want to base a life script on thi shaky foundation to mix metaphor unashamedly a to live by christ example we know very little about jesu a a person we only have hi record utterance in a set of narrative by hi follower and some very small reference from comtemporary historian revelation aside one can only know christ second-hand or worse thi be not an attempt to debunk christianity although it may seem that way initially the point i m try to make be that we only really have the bible to interpret and that interpretation be by humanity i gues thi be where faith or relevation come in with all it inherent subjectivenes metaphysically if there be multiple moral code then there be no absolute moral code and i think thi be theologically questionable no there may be an absolute moral code there be undoubtably multiple moral code the multiple moral code may be found in the absolute moral code a an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child may assume that the parent never swear simply because the parent ha tell the child that it be wrong now the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar where there be no child the wrongnes here be if the child disobey the parent the parent may feel that it be inappropriate to swear in front of child but may be quite happy to swear in front of animal the analogy do not quite hold water because the child know that he be of the same type a the parent and may be a parent later in life but you get the gist of it incidentally the young child consider the directive a absolute until he get older see piaget and learn a morality of hi own david on religion oh where be the sea the fish cry a they swim it clearnes through
