from kilroy dr nancy sweetie subject re food for thought on tyre there ha be a lot of discussion about tyre in sum ezekiel prophesy that the place would be mash and never rebuild a there be a lot of person live there it would appear that ezekiel wa not literally correct thi do bother me at all because i understand the language ezekiel use differently than do so-called biblical literalist for example it sometime happen that someone say my grandson be the cutest baby and then turn around and see the granddaughter and say oh is she the cutest thing thi person be not literally claim to have line up all the baby in the world accord to cutenes and discover hi own grandchild tie for first rather he be try to expres hi emotion use word that be very object-oriented because thi example be one that be common to many person nobody misunderstand the intent of the statement the bible however be often at the mercy of person who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true for those person the existence of tyre be a problem for me it be not turning to the latest person try to defend ezekiel we read thi from john e king the prophesy clearly imply that person would still be live in the area no it imply nothing of the kind if you have nothing but the prophecy from ezekiel and you be tell you interpret it literally you would never say oh he mean that there will be house and business and plant and stuff like that you would read i will make you a bare rock and you will never be rebuild and you conclude that tyre would be a bare rock the only way to get from fish net to house and build and a medium-large population be if you know that all that latter stuff be there in other word ymy answer mean that ezekiel mislead everybody who read the prophecy at the time it wa write there be no way that give a literal read they could read thi passage and conclude medium-size city you seem to feel that never be rebuild mean be rebuild maybe so but it be hardly a clear implication mr king also write so far i see state figurer range from to let assume the latter one be correct by modern standard we be talk about a one-horse town well no that only a bite le than the population of annapoli where i from you know the naval acadamy the state capital george washington resign hi commission in the statehouse annapoli may not be new york but it at least a two-horse town but suppose person be a small town it still person more than ezekiel predict and you say nothing about the other problem in chapter ezekiel predict that nebuchadnezzar will will destroy tyre and loot all their valuable however nebuchadnezzar do not destroy tyre and in chapter ezekiel even quote god a say he and hi army get no reward from the campaign he lead against tyre let ignore alexander for a moment and just pay attention to chapter ezekiel say n would destroy tyre and n do not destroy tyre ezekiel say that n would plunder their valuable but n do not plunder their valuable regardles of what you think about tyre now the fact be that n die before the place wa destroy ezekiel say n wa go to do it and n do not thi post be of course pointles inerrantist have an amaze ability to rewrite the bible a need to fit whatever they want it to say for example i expect mr king to respond to the comment about ezekiel by pull some clear implication out of hat when ezekiel say that n would demolish ymy tower that clearly imply that the wall would still be stand so person would know where the tower use to be and when ezekiel say that n would demolish ymy fine house and throw ymy stone timber and rubble into the sea that clearly imply that n would never set foot on the island and when ezekiel write that n would build a ramp up to ymy wall that clearly imply that n would spend year stomp around on the mainland and never get close to the wall see a few clear implication that be totally contrary to the text and you can reconcile anything you want darren f provine kilroy do you know why i the enabler because you demand it cliff claven
