from daveb dave butler subject objectivity wa after year thi discussion on objective seem to be fall into solipsism eg the recent challenge from frank dwyer for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomenon someone even make the statement that science be subjective and that even atom be subjective thi be get a bite silly and the word objective be lose all mean let start by remember the definition of objective which ha be already present objective adj of or have to do with a material object a distinguish from a mental concept having actual existence unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice b based on observable phenomenon the objectivity of a thing be not base on whether everyone agree on that thing eg the world be objectively round regardles of the fact that there exist flat earther but rather whether it be base observable and verifiable phenomenon instead of be base solely on people wish feel mental process etc thu atom be base on very observable and repeatable phenomenon be indeed consider to be objective rather than subjective even weird high energy physic be base on observable phenomenon even though that observation can change the outcome nor be those observable phenomenon affect by emotion or personal prejudice eg chemical reaction do not change to the whim of different person thu to say that science be not objective ie objectively verifiable be a bite silly a that be the point of science now i will agree that science be not objectively good i will not thereby conclude though that science be not objective now some example thing which be objective a tractor be larger than the average breadbox chlorophyll be green seawater contain salt there exist ozone in the atmosphere at least presently ozone block ultraviolet light ultraviolet light increase the incident of skin cancer good on the other hand be a value judgement it do seem to have an existence apart from what we give it unles someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which ha define good we can not quantify it touch it or collect it in any concrete sense eg i have a bag full of good now we do sometime attempt to give the word good an objective mean good ha be use to denote strength resiliency speed etc that though be a subjective definition a some might not see strength and etc a necessarily good eg strength inspire by naziism be not generally view a good a to a morality i can not say that i have ever see a morality strictly base on verifiable observable phenomenon the closest i have see be some form of the golden rule which conclude that it be best not to deliberately pi person off a they will likely then involve themself in ymy life in a manner you wo like thi be verifiable when you get in someone face they will often retaliate another objective fact about morality be that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group and thu can at time ignore that form of the golden rule without fear of reprisal now a to whether thi enforce of morality be good or bad be quite subjective by the way remember that subjective do not mean that a thing can not be formally state or even commonly agree upon it only mean that that it be not verifiable from observable phenomenon or ha a physical existence unto itself also note that i have not state that there be no such thing a an objective morality or that i could not accept any such a morality i have simply state that i have see no evidence of any such morality one other thing to notice objective be many time use a synonymou with true absolute and subjective sometime ha the connotation of false relative tai necessarily so for instance when a conclusion be base on objective but insufficient evidence then it can be both objective and false a to absolute it be easy to note that while we can objectively show that tnt be explosive but that do not absolutely mean that all tnt will explode and thu objective be not necessarily absolute either on the other hand something subjective can also be either absolutist or true for instance there be some theist who be specifically absolutist in their morality even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up further many a scientist and detective ha be motivate by subjective reason eg a gut feel or hunch to investigate a phenomenon or situation and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesi on the whole though i would have to agree that objective evidence be much more trustworthy than subjective evidence later dave butler in start any thesi it seem to me one should put forward a one point of departure something incontrovertible the expression should be simple and dignify diogene
