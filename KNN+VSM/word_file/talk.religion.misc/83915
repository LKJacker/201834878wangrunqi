from turpin russell turpin subject re christian meta-ethic i write and who be to say that thi interpretation be twist there be many passage in the bible that in their most straightforward read show the christian god behave in just thi way in article ddavi dave davi write thi require the assumption that all interpretation be equally valid that there be no way of reasonably distinguish among them i would make that assumption i do think it be a reasonable assumption no it follow from the fact that most christian choice of interpretation stem from a mix of belief that be influence by the secular ethic of their culture and that be not fully determine by scripture whether or not there be some right interpretation matter not few christian claim the ability to read the mind of their god dave davi should note that it wa michael who first state the importance of secular and cultural influence in thi thread i think michael be right in thi but regardles it should be note that thi ha not be a point of contention between michael and myself i have argue beyond michael claim that the christian scripture be open to so many interpretation include a wide divergence within the christian tradition that even their most important theme be vague again it do not matter that there be some right interpretation unles there be a way to determine what that right interpretation be it be the lack of an objective measure not the presume lack of an answer that put the force behind the line i argue michael and i and other read bible with christian glass among the thing that thi should imply be that the nt inform the ot even to the point of dominanting it some point in the ot ceremonial dietary law be explicitly abrogate by the nt text there be enough christian glass vary over a sufficiently broad range of color that i can find a few that support my example no michael the conservative christian also take the gospel seriously what differentiate you be the way you interpret the gospel russell turpin here be misplace not to say inappropriate michael self-description must govern the equation of radical liberal which seem imply by russell turpin be wrong in my opinion what make michael radical be that he fully acknowledge that christian scripture and tradition fail to determine the doctrine that so many branch within christianity hold dear he be will to live and practice hi religion within thi indeterminacy and he be will to acknowledge that much of hi understand of thing christian be influence by idea that be not purely christian those christian i have call conservative must also interpret but they do not recognize or at least be unwilling to admit the extent and importance of thi russell turpin in an earlier post have say that michael michael theological position actually do tell him much about christianity dean simeon respond thi time gently do you mean more direct perhap would have be could you possibly mean the imply rhetorical effort to separate michael from the tradition be a failure michael be in the tradition if ymy idea of the tradition do include him change ymy idea of the tradition i recognize that michael be part of the tradition but what do it tell one about a tradition cover origen aquina jerry fallwell and jesse jackson that it also include michael siemon not very much in short it be the extra-christian principle that make michael christianity beneficial and i suspect they would be a beneficial perhap moreso without be filter by christian interpretation thi conclusion do not follow even in short from the argument that go before a surprise logical ellipsi i think the conclusion do follow the purely christian principle that michael ha be the one he share with other in the christian tradition or that can be derive from christian scripture these necessarily vague be not enough to drive hi political stance that one should love one neighbor be a purely christian principle that thi mean show tolerance for homosexuality be not a to these political stance they be often at odd with what be commonly hold in most of current christendom and so i suspect they could be better press outside it on the other hand i can well understand the counterpoint that these political stance become most influential when present to those who need them most thi be a theological statement worthy of barth dr turpin dd may wear the black robe of geneva yet having barely survive the effort to finish in computer science i doubt i will attempt a more difficult field any time soon russell
