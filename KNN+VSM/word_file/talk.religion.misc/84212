from sandvik kent sandvik subject re to rob lanphier in article brian brian ceccarelli write my hope be that brian will look and will see the ramification of the truck come toward him my hope be that brian will want to step out of the way my fear though be that brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway where he will certainly get run over but if he so choose he so choose and there be nothing i can do beyond that to change hi mind for it be hi choice but at thi very moment brian ha get even that far he be still at the point where he do not want to look sure he move hi eyeball to appease me but hi head will not turn around to see the entire picture so far he be satisfy with hi glimpse of the mountain off in the distance the problem be that you imagine him inside thi huge wall unable to see reality while he imagine the same about you clearly we have a case where relativity play a big role concern look at opposite frame of reality cheer kent sandvik alink ksand private activity on the net
