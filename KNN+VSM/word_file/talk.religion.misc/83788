subject re ld rick reply from librba in article psyrobtw robert weis say just briefly on something that you mention in pass you refer to differ interpretation of create and say that many christian may not agree so what that be really irrelevant we do not base my faith on how many person think one way or another do we the bottom line be truth regardles of popularity of opinion i sorry i think we be discuss heresy i assume that heresy mean a departure from orthodoxy in which case generally accept belief be indeed an important issue in thi case the definition of the word create be of great importance since creation be the issue be discuss also i find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create and eternally existent be equivalent you say grant the mormon belief you ca grant ymy conclusion and then expect the point to have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to addres and answer the point that wa raise and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant i should have say give the mormon belief if you disagree with the mormon belief that creation be more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation then that be the important point the bible state that lucifer wa create the bible state that jesu be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the ld belief be that jesu and lucifer be the same correction you interpret the bible to mean something very specific by such term the mormon belief be that all be child of god literally there be nothing symbolic about it thi however contradict what the bible say the bible teach that not everyone be a child of god it alway crack me up when anti-mormon presume to tell mormon what they believe mormon do in fact believe that all person include christ and lucifer be child of god in the sense that we be all create or organize or whatever by him we also believe that be offspring of god ha a symbolic sense when apply to be spiritually bear again of him thu the same word can be use to convey different mean thi be how language work robert and it why make someone an offender for a word be dangerou thi be really a red herring it do addres any issue raise but rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read something into the bible do change what the bible teach for we first look to the bible to see what it teach to discount or not even addres what the bible teach because there be some group that have differ view be self-defeating to see what the bible teach you have to look at the bible on the contrary robert it be not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the bible can not seem to agree on what it say you say that one must simply look at the bible to see what it teach but century of person do just that have that no one be really sure what it say are we to believe that you be the only one who really understand the scripture i find thi rather curiou when i mention that the mormon belief be that jesu need to be save i put forward some quote from the late apostle bruce mcconkie the curiou part be that no one address the issue of jesu need to be save rick come the closest with hi i have my own conclusion to address the point let me clarify thi one more time you do not refer to the mormon belief that jesu need to be save but rather to mcconkie belief in same we keep try to point out to you that bruce mcconkie be not the source of mormon doctrine and you keep ignore it see below most of the other reply have instead hop-scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether hi view be doctrine i do think that it matter if mcconkie view be canon that be not the issue were mcconkie write indicative of mormon belief on thi subject be the real issue the indication from rick be that they may certainly be on the contrary robert if you be quote mcconkie word a mormon canon then the question of whether they be canon or not be of great importance the fact be that they be not whether or not they indicate general mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interview a large number of mormon robert weis psyrobtw rick anderson librba
