from whitten david whitten subject re merlin mithra and magick caldwell larry caldwell write there evidently wa a feast of bread and wine associate with mithra i have often wonder if yeshua intentionally introduce thi ritual to expand the appeal of hi religion or if it wa appropriate by later worshiper you could argue that if you want but i think a more reasonable argument would point out the fact that the remembrance feast wa very similar to the pesach passover meal during seder a very jewish ritual the fact that there appear to be an abuse in the early church of person eat too much a very real concern with some passover meal and not treat the meal with respect show the simplify of the ritual to just bread and wine to be a way of deal with the inherent problem of person human nature and try to keep the essential of the remembrance aspect david whitten u i do speak a a company rep
