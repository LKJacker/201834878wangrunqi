from hedrick charle hedrick subject re clarification of personal position jesu and the law sandvik kent sandvik write my online bible be on a cd but i do own a cd-rom system for the time be so i ca search for the famou cite where jesu explicitly state that he do want to break exist jewish law in other word technically speak christian should use saturday and not sunday a their holy day if they want to conform to the teach of jesu i think the passage you look for be the follow matthew think not that i have come to abolish the law and the prophet i have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them matthew for truly i say to you till heaven and earth pa away not an iotum not a dot will pa from the law until all be accomplish matthew whoever then relaxe one of the least of these commandment and teach man so shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven but he who do them and teach them shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven matthew for i tell you unles ymy righteousnes exceed that of the scribe and pharisee you will never enter the kingdom of heaven there be several problem with thi the most seriou be that the law wa regard by jew at the time and now a bind on jew but not on gentile there be rule that be bind on all human be the so-called noachic law but they be quite minimal the issue that the church have to face after jesu death wa what to do about gentile who want to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them do say that the law wa abolish it simply acknowledge that fact that it do apply to gentile thi be a simple answer which i think just about everyone can agree to a discussion of the issue in more or le these term be record in act however there more involve in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grip with paul apparent rejection of the law and how that relate to jesu commendation of the law at least a i read paul he say that the law serve a purpose that ha be in a certain sense supercede again thi issue be one of the abolition of the law in the middle of hi discussion paul note that he might be understand thi way and assure u that that not what he intend to say rather he see the law a primarily be present to convict person of their sinfulnes but ultimately it an impossible standard and one that ha be supercede by christ paul comment be not the world clearest here and not everyone agree with my read but the interest thing to notice be that even thi radical position do not entail an abolition of the law it still remain a an uncompromising standard from which not an iotum or dot may be remove for it purpose of convict of sin it important that it not be relax however for christian it not the end ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical category they use be rather different in the end i think jesu and paul come to a rather similar conclusion the quote passage from mat should be take in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesu show u how he interpret the law the not an iotum or dot would suggest a rather literal read but in fact that not jesu approach jesu interpretation emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial detail indeed he be well know for take a rather free attitude toward the sabbath and kosher law some scholar claim that mat need to be take in the context of cent jewish discussion jesu accuse hi opponent of care about give a tenth of even the most minor herb but neglect the thing that really matter justice mercy and faith and care about how cup and plate be clean but not about the fact that inside the person who use them be full of extortion and rapacity mat thi and the discussion later in mat suggest that jesu ha a very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talk about maintain the law in it full strength he be think of these aspect of it paul conclusion be similar while he talk about the law be supercede all of the specific example he gife involve the ceremonial law such a circumcision and the sabbath he be quite concern about maintain moral standard the net result of thi be that when paul talk about the law be supercede and jesu talk about the law be maintain i believe they be talk about different aspect of the law paul be embroil in argument about circumcision a be natural in letter respond to specific situation he look at the aspect of the law that be currently cause trouble the law a specifically jewish ceremoney he certainly do not intend to abolish divine standard of conduct on the other hand when jesu commend the law he seem to be talk the law in it broadest implication for moral and human relationship and deemphasizing those aspect that be later to give paul so much trouble it unfortunate that person use the same term in different way but we should be familiar with that from current conflict look at the way term like family value take on special mean from the current context imagine some poor historian of the future try to figure out why family value should be use a a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the i think law have take on a similar role in the argument paul wa involve in paul wa clearly not reject all of the jewish value that go along with the term law any more than person who concern about the family value movement be really oppose to family value
