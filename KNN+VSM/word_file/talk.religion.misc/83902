from turpin russell turpin subject re christian meta-ethic in article ml michael siemon write well the whole point of make these the base commandment be that they reducible to rule a set of rule be a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for act such thing can be very helpful to individual or society but not if they be use instead of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one action the two commandment be rule they be merely rule that be so vague that they be practically devoid of mean michael siemon acknowledge thi every time he write that the resolution of an argument over them turn on secular and cultural assumption that be independent of these rule the great commandment be more than anything else a call to act a if you be god and accept ultimate responsibility in ymy every action the commandment to love ymy neighbor a yourself can be view in part a remind man that he be not god and can not act a if he ha ultimate responsibility indeed many tradition present an interpretation where believer be suppose to interpret love one neighbor a follow variou other rule and rely on their god to make thing come out right precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility once again we be confront with good sound goo that mean whatever the reader want it to mean conservative may twist thi act a if you be god to mean lay down rule for other person and be a nasty to them a possible if they do keep ymy rule they be so insistent and obviou about thi that they have convince a lot of person who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy is how god act and who be to say that thi interpretation be twist there be many passage in the bible that in their most straightforward read show the christian god behave in just thi way michael can not refer to base claim or base commandment to show that such read be twist because thi divergence in understand occur even in try to interpret the base claim and commandment in address conservative christian michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notion that these conservative christian will reject but why should anyone be look for an ethical system since my society be eager to hand u one or more no matter what we do it may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical system in which case i will profer the agapate allelou once again but these base commandment be too vague to serve a a principle for the critique of ethical system the mean of these base commandment for any believer derife from the secular and cultural notion that the believer bring to them from how the believer mix their demand with straightforward read of other biblical passage from a particular sectarian tradition or from some combination of these thing these commandment lack sufficient substance in themself to serve a a basi for criticize ethical system what mean they have come from the ethical system the believer bring to these commandment and different body of christian have from the begin urge different ethical system or in some case none a a result it be bizarre to identify any one of these system however popular or infamou with christianity christianity do not have a torah it do not have a specifically christian scripture ha very little if anything in the way of commandment so little that the christian who desperately want commandment go mine for them with almost no support the one single thing in the gospel which jesu specifically gife a a commandment to u be love one another jesu explicitly state that thi summarize jewish law which would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what it mean to love god and love my neighbor there be many parable and teach the gospel attribute to jesu that be straightforwardly read a ethical commandment the pauline epistle be similarly full if it be not clear that these all come together in a sensible understand of ethical behavior the problem be not a lack of raw material i be a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously no michael the conservative christian also take the gospel seriously what differentiate you be the way you interpret the gospel why do i and the myriad of other christian like me tell you something about christianity in a sense the wide variety of interpretation do tell u something about christianity it tell u that the new testament author leave a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve a the source text for many vastly different belief about the nature of the christian god and about what man should and should do the irony here be that there be nothing in christianity per se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbian and gay every christian principle he turn to thi cause be effective only through the extra-christian principle through which michael interpret hi religion and the homophobe apply the same christian principle with equal justification to their cause in short it be the extra-christian principle that make michael christianity beneficial and i suspect they would be a beneficial perhap moreso without be filter by christian interpretation michael paint a picture of standard american atheism a the rejection of the evil in many conservative christian interpretation of the bible but i think it be even more damage to christianity to note that the new testament present such a vague hodge-podge of notion about the nature of god and the nature of the good except of course when it be order by an interpretation that rely on extraneou principle here i think we should apply a christian parable where a cold drink can have it value and a hot drink can have it value but the lukewarm we should spit out russell
