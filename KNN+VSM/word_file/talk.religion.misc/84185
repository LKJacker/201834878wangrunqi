from halat jim halat subject the fact of the theory in article adpeter andy peter write stuff delete andy i think we do agree give ymy clarification of how we be each use the term fact and theory i only add that i think perhap i feel more strongly about separate them though ymy usage be quite valid note that the fact of evolution be still a theory in other word it could theoretically still be falsify and reject but since it so predictive and so consistently support by evidence it seem pointles to explicitly try to falsify it anymore i add here that any falsification or rejection do not in any way reduce it current usefulnes so long a it accurately predict or describe thing we can observe not to be a pain in the a but be there any reason you do just say the theory of evolution rather than the fact of evolution be still a theory i ask because thi whole thread get start because i wa bother by a post that refer to the fact of evolution basically leave off the phrase be still a theory without a clarification like the one you just give just say the fact of evolution ha a very different mean to me description of atomic theory and alternative theory of gravity delete both be very useful model that have no religiou overtone or requirement of faith unles of course you want to demand that it be a factual physical entity describe exactly the way the theory now formulate talk about it here be where you fail to make an important distinction you have shoehorn the fact of the existence of gravity and atom and evolution into one category with the theory which have be propose to explain the mechanism the existence of these thing be so predictive a to be consider fact the mechanism on the other hand be still worth discuss i not sure i agree here again it may be because i feel stronger about separate term i wa try to say that the theory propose to explain the mechanism and the mechanism themself be the only reality here it be the existence of mechanism not the thing themself that be so predictive a to be consider fact a you would say there be really little planetary particle system call atom out there or i should say and more to my original point it would be a leap of faith to say there be because we observe only the mechanism there be no need to believe there be actually atom out there a we have decide to think about them it enough to discus the mechanism at any rate i not sure i be be any clearer than before but i think it wa worth a shoot the bottom line though be i think we agree on two fundamental idea evolution be a theory support by observational evidence my way the fact of evolution be a theory support by observational evidence ymy way creation be just an opinion if a theist want to call it a theory then he can i wo it ha no support evidence and it neither predict nor support any observation that can be make with no mechanism to talk about there really be much to say do you agree jim halat halat bear-stearn whatever do kill you will only serve to annoy you nyc i speak only for myself
