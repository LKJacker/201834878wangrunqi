from emarsh eric marsh subject re after year can we say that christian morality be in article mr frank frank write in article pww peter walker write in article fkt frank frank write objective morality be morality build from objective value but where do those objective value come from how can we measure them what mediate thair interaction with the real world a moralon or a scalar valuino field science the real world ha it basi in value not the other way round a you would wish it if there be no such thing a objective value then science can not objectively be say to be more useful than a kick in the head simple theory with accurate prediction could not objectively be say to be more useful than a set of tarot card you like those conclusion i do i think that you be change the mean of value here perhap it be time to backtrack and take a look at the word value n a fair equivalent or return for something such a good or service monetary or material worth worth a measure in usefulnes or importance merit a principle standard or quality consider inherently worthwhile or desirable precise mean a of a word an assign or calculate numerical quantity mu the relative duratation of a tone or rest the relative darknes or lightnes of a color the distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound in context of a moral system definition fmy seem to fit best in term of scientific usage definition six or eight might apply note that these definition do not mean the same thing in my mind to say that science ha it basi in value be a bite of a reach science ha it basi in observable fact even the usage of the word value above do not denote observable fact but rather a standard of measurement i would conclude that science do not have it basi in value and so ymy statement above fail in fact if one conclude that a scientific set of measurement value be base on system derive from observation then it must follow that in a scientific context there be no such thing a there be no such thing a objective value back to the present thi ha nothing to do with a moral system anyhow just because the word value be use in both context do not mean that there be a relationship between the two context if one be to argue for objective value in a moral sense then one must first start by demonstrate that morality itself be objective considering the mean of the word objective i doubt that thi will ever happen so back to the original question and objective morality be if you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will be a good begin frank not hatch that odwyer from hen by evelyn conlon eric
