from kltensme kermit tensmeyer subject re rw is robert weis the only orthodox christian in article psyrobtw robert weis write in article librba write rick anderson write ra robert you keep make reference to orthodox belief and say ra thing like it be hold that cf kermit thread on what ra exact body of theology be you draw for what you call orthodox orthodox be a compound word it come from straight true right and from opinion doctrine teach i use orthodox to refer to teach a oppose to universal or catholic or foursquare gosple i think that the greek orthodox church would take high offense at ymy misuse of the word ymy version of christianity be neither mainstream nor bible derive you make claim of bible-centricity that be not derivable soley from the bible about six-seven month ago you claim that ymy primary objection to the ld wa that my doctrine wa not bible-derived and now thi and other claim can be show be also not bible interpeting bible right teach be derive from let god speak to u through the bible thi can be from read simple truth in the scripture and by use the bible to interpret the bible simple truth oh for example ra who be that hold that luke mean what you say he mean i think that it be apparent from read the scripture that be pertinent luke record christ promise to the repentant thief who hang on an adjacent cro truly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise but wa it not until later that christ rise from the dead and ascend to heaven if christ himself wa not in heaven until sunday how could the repentant thief have be there with him the answer ly in the location of paradise when jesu die apparently paradise wa not exalt to heaven until easter day paradise exalt to heaven paradise wa equal to heaven and now it be yet you claim that peeple can not be exalt to heaven nicht wahr jesu refer to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and lazaru a abraham bosom to which the godly beggar lazaru wa carry by the angel after hi decease luke thu abraham bosom refer to the place where the soul of the redeem wait till the day of christ resurrection when i read the story i find that abraham bosom wa so much a place but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to abraham it wa not yet lift to heaven but it may well have be a section of hade hebrew sheol reserve for believer who have die in the faith but would not be admit into the gloriou presence of god in heaven until the price of redemption have actually be pay on calvary or even that none would precede the presence of jesu back to glory with the father gee thi be fairly close to what the ld call spirit prison and what you have call false doctrine doubtles it wa the infernal paradise that the soul of jesu and the repentant thief repair after they each die on friday afternoon but on sunday after the rise christ have first appear to mary magdalene john and her two companion matthew presumably he then take up with him to glory all the inhabitant of infernal paradise include abraham lazaru and the repentant thief we read in ephesian concern christ ascending on high he lead captivity captive he give gift unto man ver delete reproduce below quote from the sunspot gopher archive presumably he lead the whole band of liberate captive from hade the whole population of preresurrection paradise up to the glory of heaven thi part be not support from scripture nor do it support ymy claim that the paradise where christ descend wa exalt making such claim on thi little evidence ignore the witnes of the scripture sun wherefore he saith when he ascend up on high he lead captivity sun captive and give gift unto man sun sun x-ref psalm sun thou ha ascend on hight thout hast lead captivity captive thou ha sun recieved gift for man yea for the rebelliou aslo that the lord god sun might dwell amoung them sun sun now that he ascend what be it but that he also descend first sun into the lower part of the earth he that descend be the same sun also that ascend up far above all heaven that he might fill all sun thing and he give some apostle and some prophet and sun some evangelist and some pastor and teacher for the sun perfect of the saint for the work of the ministry for the sun edify of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of sun the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man sun unto the measure of the stature of the fulnes of christ that we sun henceforth be no more child toss to and fro and carry about sun with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of man and cunning sun craftines whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speak the sun truth in love may grow up into him in all thing which be the head using thi to argue that paradise or spirit prison be now change from a pre-easter postion to post-easter by god postion be not supportable makeing such a claim require more evidence than you have give here ra whenever ymy personal interpretation of biblical passage be ra challenge ymy only response seem to be that one need merely to ra look at the bible in order to see the truth but what of those who ra see biblical thing differently from you i think that thi characterization be faulty whenever my interpretation be question i usually give a reason ye and ymy reason be in general not support by any direct read of the scripture you have demonstrate that you claim to scriptural proof need to be cross-check the referenc that you supply often do not support ymy postion if they be read in the context of the scripture a for those that see thing differently please put forward where there be a valid difference and we can discus it i seem to be see from you the notion that any difference in how one view the bible be somehow legitimate except or course for the stuff that i glean from it put forward a contrary view and perhap we can have a discussion on that topic but to decry something that i put forward without put forward something else to discus and to dismis what i put forward while give credence to other allege view that have yet to be put forward be simply be contentiou how about that those who have be in paradise and have accept the gosple will be judge of jesu christ and then return to the presence of god is that somehow different from ymy express view that the paradise speak of or abraham bosom ra are we to simply assume that you be the only one who really ra understand it if you believe that something that i have draw from scripture be wrong then please show me from scripture where it be wrong simply state that there be other view be not a proof show it to me from scripture and then we can go on should we go back and discus ymy view on why the angle of the lord be the lord again robert weis psyrobtw kermit tensmeyer intergraph corporation kltensme deep in dixie
