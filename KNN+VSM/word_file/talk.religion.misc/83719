from jame owen subject re question for those with popular morality in article david david bold write in article jame owen write you seem to be say that god be unknowable hi morality be unknowable yep that pretty much it a i understand it the sadducee believe that the torah wa all that wa require wherea the pharisee the ancestor of modern judaism believe that the torah wa available for interpretation to lead to an understand of the require morality in all it nuance talmud the essence of all of thi be that biblical morality be an interface between man and yhwh for a jew or christian and do not necessarily indicate anything about yhwh outside of that relationship although one can speculate the point i m try to make be that we only really have the bible to interpret and that interpretation be by humanity i gues thi be where faith or relevation come in with all it inherent subjectivenes god be unknowable i ca comment on hi motive but it would be distress if he allow u to misunderstand him through no fault of my own for sanity sake we must assume if we believe in him at all that hi message come through somehow the question be whether it come through immediately to every individual or be contain in a complex canon that must be interpret by expert in consultation with one another or be transmit directly through appoint representative who be free to interpret extend and modify the canon if god message be indeed mediate the further problem arise a to whether the individual under stand the mediate message fully and clearly since the responsibility for understand ly ultimately with the individual we must assume that god in hi benevolence guide each individual to the appropriate source for that individual whereof the person may or may not drink metaphysically if there be multiple moral code then there be no absolute moral code and i think thi be theologically questionable no there may be an absolute moral code there be undoubtably multiple moral code the multiple moral code may be found in the absolute moral code a an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child may assume that the parent never swear simply because the parent ha tell the child that it be wrong now the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar where there be no child the wrongnes here be if the child disobey the parent the parent may feel that it be inappropriate to swear in front of child but may be quite happy to swear in front of animal the analogy do not quite hold water because the child know that he be of the same type a the parent and may be a parent later in life but you get the gist of it incidentally the young child consider the directive a absolute until he get older see piaget and learn a morality of hi own ymy example be complicate in my age by the thin line between morality and politenes you might have say burp for burp and swear carry about the same stigma today if you be talk about take the lord name in vain a a seriou transgression then thi example be more a case of hypocrisy than of vary moral code if there be an absolute moral code proposition or law in that code apply absolutely and universally by definition conceivably some moral code could be subset of the universal code a you say at the outset so for example god code could include thou shalt not create being without a hospitable planet to live on but thi law would be inapplicable to u nevertheles we would be entitle to suppose that all law applicable to u be also applicable to god but when you begin to ask what law might appear in god moral code you have a sense of the absurdity of the question do god make law for himself to follow perhap god be not the sort of be to which the category morality can be sensibly apply jame owen ottawa ontario canada
