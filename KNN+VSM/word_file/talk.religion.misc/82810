from frank decenso jr subject biblical contradiction answered juda i post thi several day ago for dave butler he may have miss it my usenet board ha change a little just in case he miss it here it be again dave butler write from daveb dave butler newsgroup subject re new biblical contradiction fallaciously answered juda date thu apr i can basically restrict thi post to show the type of evidence mr decenso ha present and answer hi two question and a couple of hi spuriou insult and false claim my reply db by the way mr decenso you really should have look in the index of ymy bauer-arndt-gingrich greek lexicon you would have find that the word in act for lot be klero not chorion a state by mr archer and nowhere in the very large discussion of klero in do the to theological dictionary of the new testament by bromley be the mean burial plot discuss it discus the form of klero eg klero kleroo etc and the variou mean of klero eg plot of land and inheritance but mention nothing about chorion or burial plot why do thi not surprise me thu it would seem to be a very good thing you dump archer a a reference db later correct himself from daveb dave butler newsgroup subject re new biblical contradiction fallaciously answered juda date frus apr i owe the group an apology it be my habit to check my article before and after their submission for error in my last article i state by the way mr decenso you really should have look in the index of ymy bauer-arndt-gingrich greek lexicon you would have find that the word in act for lot be klero not chorion a state by mr archer and nowhere in the very large discussion of klero in do the to theological dictionary of the new testament by bromley be the mean burial plot discuss it discus the form of klero eg klero kleroo etc and the variou mean of klero eg plot of land and inheritance but mention nothing about chorion or burial plot why do thi not surprise me thu it would seem to be a very good thing you dump archer a a reference i wa wrong i admit that i do not have a handle on greek grammar and thu confuse klero the second to last word in act a be the plot of land discuss in actuality it be chorion which be the last word act unfortunately my greek dictionary do not discus chorion so i can not report a to the nuance of the word i do know if someone else would have catch thi though i be sure that someone would be able to do so but i have an aversion to disseminate mistake especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point my reply vary noble of you dave i do want to have to go to x number of source to show you wrong although i be research chorion a little db of course the only other reference mr decenso ha give be bullinger and bullinger use such ridiculou exegisi that when i accuse mr decenso of actually believe bullinger he reply that i misquote him and you maintain that you find such exegesi convince oh dear my reply ymy misquote of me be astound dave read the begin of thi part of my response to see what i really say in my post of thi article actually mr decenso you say that there wa benefit to my argument in that it cause to to rediscover bullinger exegisi i do not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial unles you be convince by it my reply thank you for correct ymy restate of my point db and mr decenso also reply dave these be not necessarily my view they be bullinger we will discus the land issue in later post i sure i only respond to thi one you have direct re bullinger view because it enjoyable thu i apologize for think that even mr decenso could find such drek convince he should specify which part of bullinger he find convince and quit hide behind a disingenuou mask of thi be what bullinger believe not necessarily what i believe so which be it mr decenso do you find the exegisi convince or not my reply one of my purpose in debate these allege contradiction with you and other be to diseminate many different view of possible reconciliation raise by variou bible scholar and student alike when i present my view i will clearly distinguish them from now on db of course without archer and bullinger we find that mr decenso ha present no greek exegisi at all and mr decenso ha make a big thing about my not refer back to the actual greek thu we find thi demand on hi part for quality greek exegisi to be a hypocritical requirement my reply good point but in ymy declare that these passage be contradictory you have produce only superficial reason and observation nor have you dig deeper i glad you have begin in thi post i will begin greek study on these passage in more depth than i think necessary a well db it would be appropriate to look at what mr decenso ha actually used a evidence now we know what he claim for a standard a he ha state it often enough a the text itself b parallel passage c other pertinent scripture d historical context e historical content f other pertinent historical info g cultural context h cultural content i other pertinent cultural info j grammatical construction k hebrew and greek word study l etc but be these actual standard he ha use or simply empty hyperbole let see he ha use a and since he be try to reconcile it to other passage we see that he ha also use b on the other hand he ha present no use of d historical context or e historical content or f other pertinent historical info or g cultural context or h cultural content or i other pertinent cultural info or j grammatical construction or even k hebrew and greek word study remember archer and bullinger do count thu we find hi vaunt criterium for exegisi be just empty mouth my reply question do you find such criterium important if so do you plan on start to use them to the best of ymy ability or will you continue to present shallow observation i do mean thi in a bad way at thi point in my debate i have not find it necessary to present a total exegetical analysi of these passage since we seem to keep beat around the bush and not get into the core of the verse i do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criterium to refute ymy argument re juda in act and matthew but i will do my best from thi point on to use several of the above criterium since you desire me to i hope you will also it will greatly enhance my study of these passage db the only thing he ha actually use beyond the passage itself be any other passage thu mr decenso should be honest and note that most of hi list be red herring and hi only real criterium seem to be a the text itself b parallel passage my reply the reason be simple you be mistating the passage you claim that the passage contradict one another i do not see the passage contradict one another they may very well be complimentary a many scholarly source mention matthew may not be present juda death a you claim but we look at ymy defense of thi later also the reward of iniquity in the act passage may not be the piece of silver in matthew passage although you have a valiant attempt later at state why you believe it be at thi begin stage in my debate we be lay some scriptural groundwork which will be expand upon through deeper exegesi db of course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage a he ha do with juda death be to make it agree with another passage so that both could be consider correct my reply one of the reason i have give a different exegetical view of the passage be that you seem to think the majority of scholarship be wrong in conclude these passage be complimentary however i see no problem in tony rose explanation of juda death how would you explain the inaccuracy between juda hanging himself in matthew and falling headlong he burst open thi question of the manner in which juda die be one with which we be constantly confront in my travel many person point to the apparent discrepancy in the two account a an obviou irreconcilable error some have go so far a to say that the idea of an inerrant bible be destroy by these contradictory account however thi be not the case at all matthew relate that juda hang himself while peter tell u he fell and wa crush by the impact the two statement be indeed different but do they necessarily contradict each other matthew do not say that juda do not fall neither do peter say that juda do not hang himself thi be not a matter of one person call something black and the other person call it white both account can be true and supplementary a possible reconstruction would be thi juda hang himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlook the valley of hinnom after he hang there for some time the limb of the tree snap or the rope give way and juda fell down the ledge mangle hi body in the proces the fall could have be before or after death a either would fit thi explanation thi possibility be entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom be examine from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terrace to foot in height and almost perpendicular there be still tree around the ledge and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it be easy to conclude that juda strike one of the jag rock on thi way down tear hi body open it be important to remember that we be not tell how long juda remain hang from the tree or how advance wa the decomposition of hi body before hi fall loui gaussen relate a story of a man who wa determine to kill himself thi individual place himself on the sill of a high window and point a pistol at hi head he then pull the trigger and leap from the window at the same time on the other hand a person could say that thi man take hi life by shoot himself while another could rightly contend he commit suicide by jump form the tall build in thi case both be true a both be true in the case of matthew and peter account of the death of juda it be merely a situation of different perspective of the same event ymy only reason for reject thi be i believe ymy attempt to discredit inerrancy you have relate how thi be impossible or highly unlikely here what you say in an earlier post db quote tony rose there be still tree around the ledge and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it be easy to conclude that juda strike one of the jag rock on thi way down tear hi body open it be important to remember that we be not tell how long juda remain hang from the tree or how advance wa the decomposition of hi body before hi fall the add text in thi version be so heavy that assume you be truly so oppose to such tactic you should find it not credible but you seem to find tony rose eisegesi satisfactory while clearly reject david joslin here you discredit tony explanation base on what you deem too heavy for the passage but you have address why you feel that way you can say it a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction but that do tell me it do happen nor have you show why you reject that possibility question is matthew lie or be luke lie or be they both lie or be either or both of them misinform why do you think there be such an allege contradiction i do not think you have ever tell u what you believe in thi respect db at present though mr decenso only ask two question of me you claim act and matthew contradict one another in represent juda death i ask you again to provide evidence that matthew state juda die in the hang you claim that the piece of silver in matthew that juda throw down in the temple and the chief priest use be the reward of iniquity in act that picture juda in some way purchase a field with therefore there be a contradiction prove that the piece of silver and the reward of iniquity be one and the same actually i find question to be a rather stupid request but i will answer it because he now restrict himself to two point first i would point out that hang be a very efficient manner for end a life in fact it be a bite of a fluke when someone survife hang except in fantasy cowboy movie and even then it usually refer to a an attempt hang my reply i work at an agency that investigate child abuse and neglect today i get a call re a child that attempt suicide by hang himself because hi mother be on crack he fail in hi attempt and be in a child psych ward at a local hospital hanging attempt be not alway successful to assume that because most hang be successful thi one wa also be beg the question if i may quote you last night listen to the bible answer man broadcast the christian research institute show one of the scholar on there use several of these term that you use i be not all that familiar with them the man on the bam show teach comparative religion and logic it wa interest db thi be so prevalent that so that to say a man hang himself with no other qualifier be synonymou with state that he kill himself my reply qualifier be important at time a we see in an ot passage i mention below do hang alway have thi outcome did matthew who be the only source we have re juda hang himself state that juda die a a result to say it synonymou mean it ha the same mean a a boy age hang himself but he live thi be only one of probably thousand of document case we can discover db now i be not alone in thi think in fact since mr decenso so respect christian scholarly include greek scholar opinion i do some research my reply thank you dave db interestingly not one of the christian reference i read interpret the hang a be anything but a fatal suicide my reply above mine so it ok to use christian source to back ymy point what about tony position do you value it or even consider it a a valid possibility also be it possible that the source you read may be wrong or lie or deceive in other part of their book if so should we do a we have do with archer tos them to the side and not value anything they say include their interpretation of the hang of juda i be sure you would find some error and maybe even some deception in those source you also note they interpret the hang a mean he die although that be very possibly true do you find that in the text itself remember that the first criterium we must examine db thi include the biblical knowledge commentary by woodward and zuck my reply which i own it a good source of commentary info but not inerrant db the interpreter on volume commentary on the bible by laydon the one volume bible commentary by j r dunelow word mean of the testament ralph earl the abingdon bible commentary publish by abingdon harper bible commentary by william neal actually i could have present many more a well my reply i appreciate ymy do thi research dave maybe we be get somewhere in how we both should approach these allege contradiction more in depth study db in each case these reference specifically describe that the interpretation of matt a successful suicide and thu i can only conclude that the greek word apagchw ie hang oneself be translate a a successful hang my reply above mine no you ca only conclude thi although a tony say thi wa a highly probable outcome but matthew do not state death a be a result the greek word be apagcho matthew be it only occurrence in the new testament in the septuagint the greek translation of the ot use at the time of jesu it only use in samuel now when ahithophel saw that hi advice wa not follow he saddle a donkey and arise and go home to hi house to hi city then he put hi household in order and hang himself and die and he wa bury in hi father tomb notice that not only be it state that ahithophel hang himself gr sept apagcho but it explicitly add and die here we have no doubt of the result in matthew we be not explicitly tell juda die also there be nothing in the greek to suggest succes or failure it simply mean hang oneself db but mr decenso you be more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable christian scholar that insist that the hang wa not successful my reply above mine reputable you mean one that have never err a far a insist that the hang wa unsuccessful that ca be do even by me a i say in an earlier post although i still agree with tony exegesi a be the most probable explanation regard juda death take into account several criterium i recently notice some new thing in matthew mat then he throw down the piece of silver in the temple and depart and go and hang himself but the chief priest take the silver piece and say it be not lawful to put them into the treasury because they be the price of blood and they consult together and buy with them the potter field to bury stranger in therefore that field ha be call the field of blood to thi day first of all notice that the text do not say that juda die a a result of hang all it say be that he go and hang himself luke however in act tell u that and fall headlong he burst open in the middle and all hi entrail gush out thi be a pretty clear indication along with the other detail give in act peter speech the need to pick a new apostle etc that at least after juda fall he wa dead so the whole concept that matthew and luke both recount juda death be highly probable but not clear cut i also write my reply here we have a stickler dave that i have to say i just recently notice let look at the passage in matthew mat say i have sin by betray innocent blood and they say what be that to u you see to it mat then he throw down the piece of silver in the temple and depart and go and hang himself mat but the chief priest take the silver piece and say it be not lawful to put them into the treasury because they be the price of blood mat and they consult together and buy with them the potter field to bury stranger in mat therefore that field ha be call the field of blood to thi day notice verse then he go and hang himself matthew do not say juda die do it should we assume he die a a result of the hang what do act say act now thi man purchase a field with the wage of iniquity and fall headlong he burst open in the middle and all hi entrail gush out act for it be write in the book of psalm hi dwell place be desolate and let no one live in it and another take hi office here we may have a graphic explanation of juda death so my line of reason to dispel ymy contradiction myth re the two account of juda death be thi matthew do necessarily explain how juda die he do say juda hang himself but he do specifically say juda die in the hang incident however act seem to show u hi graphic demise therefore there be no contradiction between matthew and act re juda death my reply we do know from matthew that he do hang himself and act probably record hi death although it possible and plausible that he fell from the hang and hit some rock thereby burst open i can no longer assume that to be the case therefore no contradiction matthew do not say juda die a a result of the hang do he most scholar believe he probably do but i quote all that to show that i highly regard the scholar explanation but in look at the text initially we ca assume juda die it be however highly probable db by the way while all agree that juda die from the hang the book have different way of deal with the contradiction we be discuss one simply ignore it entirely and simply refer back to matthew version a the correct version in both matt and act the biblical knowledge commentary suggest the hypothesis that juda hang and then when he rot hi belly explode which do explain hi headlong fall or that hi branch or rope break and he fell to hi death and hi gut gush out which do explain how a hang man would fall headlong rather than foot first my reply the outcome of any fall be dependent upon many factor how high the person wa suspend before the fall any obstruction such a tree branch that may have deviate the fall how steep an incline of rocky surface the victim fell upon thu possibly roll or bounce of several rock etc in a superficial examination of the act passage and the matthew passage we be not give a lot of info on the geographical specific but tony in the above quote post give u some a possible reconstruction would be thi juda hang himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlook the valley of hinnom after he hang there for some time the limb of the tree snap or the rope give way and juda fell down the ledge mangle hi body in the proces the fall could have be before or after death a either would fit thi explanation thi possibility be entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom be examine from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terrace to foot in height and almost perpendicular there be still tree around the ledge and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it be easy to conclude that juda strike one of the jag rock on thi way down tear hi body open db now truthfully i do not see what be comfort about matthew confuse the source of the potter field prophesy but on the other hand the author be correct matthew do make that confusion of course a biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the bible be guarantee true by god will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of juda ie where the prophesy of the potter field come from my reply please when we be do with thi study on hi death remind me to discus thi with you db a to ymy second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that the money with which juda purchase the land wa indeed for the betrayal rather than some other source i would point out that in act where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity act it also specifically mention what act of iniquity they be talk about ie act concern juda who wa guide to those who arrest jesu now i would point out that when the bible describe an act of iniquity and then immediately discus the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that it wa an action of iniquity other than the one discuss my reply dave we be get somewhere be we act and in those day peter stand up in the midst of the disciple altogether the number of name wa about a hundred and twenty and say act man and brother thi scripture have to be fulfil which the holy spirit speak before by the mouth of david concern juda who become a guide to those who arrest jesu act for he wa number with u and obtain a part in thi ministry act now thi man purchase a field with the wage of iniquity and fall headlong he burst open in the middle and all hi entrail gush out act and it become know to all those dwell in jerusalem so that field be call in their own language akel dama that be field of blood act for it be write in the book of psalm hi dwell place be desolate and let no one live in it and another take hi office notice that in verse the word iniquity be not use rather it state that juda become a guide to those who arrest jesu but the writer did not stop there v for he wa number with u and obtain a part in thi ministry what part do juda play in their ministry joh thi he say not that he care for the poor but because he wa a thief and have the money box and he use to take what wa put in it joh for some think because juda have the money box that jesu have say to him buy those thing we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor so now we know what part juda play he wa a treasurer per se right after peter state that juda play a part in thi ministry treasurer accord to john then luke add the parenthetical explanation of wage of iniquity money that should have be put into the ministry but wa steal by juda to purchase a field i believe thi be a better exegetical explanation of what the wage of iniquity be what do you think dave db now since i have give you clear answer and even reference perhap you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you be instead of ask me what type i think you be a you do to mr joslin my reply i will gladly admit that i be a complete inerrantist although i do not have that big a problem with the limited inerrancy view frank if one wish to contend with him he could not answer him one time out of a thousand job
