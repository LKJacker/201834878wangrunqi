from bskendig brian kendig subject is it good that jesu die brian brian ceccarelli write brian kendig write if you can explain to me why the death of jesu wa a good thing then i would be very glad to hear it and you might even convert me be warn however that i hear all the most common argument before and they just do convince me ask jesu himself he himself say why in john it be a mystery to anyone and there certainly be no need for a persuasive argument read jesu own reply to ymy question john most assuredly i say to you unles a grain of wheat fall onto the grind and dy it remain alone but if it dy it produce much grain he who love hi life will lose it and he who hate hi life in thi world will keep it for eternal life if anyone serve me let him follow me and where i be there my servant will be also if anyone serve me him my father will honor why would i want an eternal life if i hate thi one if we be create by a deity why would that deity not wish u to enjoy what he ha give u why would i want to live forever the challenge in my life be that i will die and that i must give my life the mean i wish it to have before that happen my time be here and will someday pa i will be content to live on in the memory of my friend and once they too be dead then i will no longer have any reason to exist in short even if ymy deity do exist that do automatically mean that i would worship it i be content to live my own life and fend for myself so when i die i can be proud of the fact that no matter where i end up it will be because of my action and my choice if ymy god decide to tos me into a flame pit for thi then so be it i would much rather just cease to exist but if ymy god want my respect and my obedience then it have better earn these and if it do then they will be very strong and true jesu gife more reason in john but one obviou reason why jesu die and a with everything else it ha nothing do with hi punishment wa that he could rise to life again so that we would stop doubt and believe john the fact that jesu rise from the dead be my hope that i too will rise from the dead it be an obviou point do not overlook it without thi obviou point i would have no hope and my faith would be vanity jesu wa the only one who rise from the dead i think it wa osiri who do the same a well a a few character from greek or norse legend if memory serve but still why would i want to rise from the dead why do you want to why do jesu suffer in hi death again ask jesu jesu say why in john that no mystery either the world hate him without reason it be a direct proclamation of how far we human botch thing up and thu how much we need a savimy if ymy god want to win my devotion then it know what it can do provide some way for me to believe without have to resort to blind faith that could be apply equally well to any religion and why ca you brian k accept thi how can you the world can not accept him because it neither see him nor know him john that precisely it i neither see nor know zeu either nor odin shall i offer them the same devotion i offer jesu the animosity and the lack of knowledge that come out in ymy twist of robert daily verse be very convince testimony of the truth of john and you get to understand my point-of-view i see christian spout bible verse all the time a if it be some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition truth be it not robert ha never demonstrate that he actually understand what the verse imply he just rattle them off day by day some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality and i point these out where i can but even more than that even when christian do try to explain the verse in their own word they do so from a christian point of view which be that every human be would want to be a christian if only he or she understand the christian message properly and then all strife and suffer on the earth would end here the problem with that substitute moslem or buddhist or satanist instead of christian and it mean the same thing christanity be a very nice belief set around a very nice book but if you want to make me believe that it ha any bear on the real world you get some convince to do i pray and hope that i do blurt out such animosity and lack of knowledge i be not perfect either but regardles of that i thank god that jesu reveal himself to me without whom i also be bumble about blindly though arrogantly slander the very person who create me and who love me and in my opinion you bumble about blindly make up entity where there be any and deprive yourself of a true understand and enjoyment of ymy life a long a you keep ymy belief to yourself i keep my belief to myself but a soon a you start wave them around expect me to tos in my opinion too brian kendig je ne sui fait comme aucun bskendig de ceux que vu croire fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent the mean of life si je ne vaux pa mieux au moin je sui autre be that it end rousseau
