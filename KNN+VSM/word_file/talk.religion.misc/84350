from markp mark pundur subject re after year can we say that christian morality be in halat jim halat write in article arromdee ken arromdee write in article mathew mathew write there no objective physic einstein and bohr have tell u that speaking a one who know relativity and quantum mechanic i say bullshit speaking a someone who also know relativity and quantum mechanic i say go ahead punk make my day my degree can beat up ymy degree simple take out some physic book and start look for statement which say that there be no objective physic i doubt you will find any you might find statement that there be no objective length or no objective location but no objective physic consider for instance that speed-of-light-in vacuum be invariant thi sound an awful lot like an objective speed-of-light-in-vacuum or you can try not confuse a construct with the constructor if you take a look at quantum mechanic many objective observation can be make a well however physic be not objective bohr say the randomnes of atomic motion be inherent in the motion itself einstein say that nature be deterministic it be my method of observation that insert the randomnes they be talk about the exact same result but neither of them claim to have experimental evidence that prove them right in a similar vein there be a yet no experimental evidence for supersymmetric particle so some physicist believe in them and some do but all agree that either there be an objectively true answer to the question depend on how you look at it i gues mark pundur any resemblance between my opinion and those of wolfram research inc be purely coincidental
