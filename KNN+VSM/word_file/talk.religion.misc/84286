from mark fuller subject re rw be robert weis the only orthodox christian in article librba write robert you keep make reference to orthodox belief and say thing like it be hold that cf kermit thread on what exact body of theology be you draw for what you call orthodox who be that hold that luke mean what you say he mean whenever ymy personal interpretation of biblical passage be challenge ymy only response seem to be that one need merely to look at the bible in order to see the truth but what of those who see biblical thing differently from you are we to simply assume that you be the only one who really understand it rick i think we can safely say robert be not the only person who understand the bible and the leadership of the ld church historicly never ha let consider some personal interpretation and see how much trust we should put in orthodox mormonism which could never be confuse with orthodox christianity in one of hi attack on christian the mormon apostle bruce r mcconkie say they thrash around in darknes in try to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promise messiah he also say christian be wrong to believe that jehovah be the supreme deity god the father and that christ come into mortality a hi only begotten son mcconkie then state what mormon believe today to be the truth about the matter he say that elohim be the father and jehovah be the son being thu aware of how far astray the religiou intellectualist have go in define their three-in-one god it come a no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darknes in try to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promise messiah some sectarian even believe that jehovah be the supreme deity whose son come into mortality a the only begotten a with their concept that god be a spirit thi misinformation about the god of heaven be untrue the fact be and it too be attest by holy writ that elohim be the father and that jehovah be the son who wa bear into mortality a the lord jesu christ the promise messiah promised messiah p notice that mcconkie say the christian be a wrong about their three-in-one god and their belief that god be a spirit a they be in their understand of who elohim and jehovah be before examine mcconkie attack and it validity we shall read a few more statement by mcconkie and other mormon source concern the word elohim and jehovah mcconkie state the chief designation of christ that ha be preserve for u in the old testament a that ancient work be now publish be the exalt name-title jehovah promised messiah p elohim plural word though it be be also use a the exalt name-title of god the eternal father a usage that connote hi supremacy and omnipotence he be god above all god mormon doctrine p agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who elohim and jehovah be the apostle jame e talmage state elohim a understand and use in the restore church of jesu christ be the name-title of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit be jehovah the only begotten in the flesh jesu christ jesu the christ p a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve apostle of the mormon church state that god the eternal father be designate d by the exalt name-title article of faith p christ in hi preexistent antemortal or unembodied state wa know a jehovah article of faith p today mormon leader teach that elohim in the ot refer to god the father and jehovah refer to christ mcconkie attack christian for say jehovah can refer to the father he stress that these two name-title should not be change around so that christ be call elohim and the father be call jehovah the father be elohim not jehovah jehovah be christ and christ be jehovah they be one and the same person promised messiah p in the ot of the kjv of the bible the hebrew word elohim be use to refer to the true god false god and goddess and the judge of israel when refer to the true god elohim be translate with a capital g when refer to false god and goddess and the judge of israel it be translate with a small g it be translate fmy time a judge exod once a judge sam twice a mighty gen exod once a angel ps once a godly mal once a great gen and once a very great sam the word jehovah be the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel point take from the word adonai many person believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation wa yahweh or yahveh however since jehovah rather than yahweh be the word use by mormonism thi section will also use jehovah instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claim of mormon leader regard that name jehovah unlike elohim be never use of false god it be the personal name of the triune god of the bible in the kjv jehovah be render primarily lord sometime god and rarely lord now that we understand something about the word elohim and jehovah and their use by mormon leader we shall consider the apostle mcconkie attack on christian for believe the father be jehovah in try to prove that jehovah refer exclusively to christ mcconkie cite several verse from the bible some of these verse and mcconkie interpretation of them will be examine to see whether he wa right remember mcconkie say the father be not jehovah he be only elohim the first example we shall consider involf mcconkie interpretation of ps of thi verse he state of whom spake david when hi tongue wa touch by the holy spirit and he testify the lord say unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemy thy footstool ps two lord be here involve one be speak to the other one be greater than the other one be make provision for the triumph and glory of the other who be they and what message be contain in thi messianic prophecy what think ye of christ my lord ask certain of hi detractor toward the end of hi mortal ministry whose son be he is christ the son of god or of someone else is he to be bear of a divine parent or will he be a other man a mortal son of a mortal father that he wa to be a descendant of david wa a matter of great pride to all the jew and so they answer the son of david david son truly he wa but he wa more much more and so my lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture ask how then doth david in spirit call him lord say the lord say unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemy thy footstool if david then call him lord how be he hi son that be if he be only the son of david how be it that the great king act under inspiration call him lord and worship him a such and we might add who be the other lord the one who spake unto david lord can there be any question a to how jesu be interpret the word of the psalm he be say that it mean father say unto the son elohim say unto jehovah sit thou on my right hand until after ymy mortal ministry then i will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever promised messiah pp emphasi add agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie the follow remark in the mormon pamphlet what the mormon think of christ p read the lord elohim the father say unto my lord jehovah the son bracket in original mcconkie clearly state that it be elohim the father who be speak to jehovah the son in thi psalm however when one look at the hebrew word translate lord it become apparent that either the first lord be not the father or else the father be jehovah either way mcconkie be wrong the psalm read the lord jehovah say unto my lord adon sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemy thy footstool ps the first lord in thi verse be jehovah who mormonism say be christ not the father the second lord be the hebrew word adon singular for adonai mean master or lord if the first lord be the father and the second lord be the son then the father be jehovah and the son be adon however if the father be not jehovah a mcconkie claim then the first lord be jehovah the son but who then be adon obviously the father be jehovah in thi psalm and hi son be adon another example involf isa about which mcconkie state the follow i the lord have call thee in righteousnes isaiah quote the father a say of christ and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the person for a light of the gentile isa promised messiah p emphasi add mcconkie say the father wa speak of christ in thi passage which read i the lord jehovah have call thee in righteousnes and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the person for a light of the gentile isa according to mcconkie i the lord refer to the father and thine and thee refer to christ however the lord who be speak be jehovah which mean either mcconkie wa wrong about who be speak or else the father be jehovah another example involf ps of these verse mcconkie state the same psalm say all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head say he trust on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him see he delight in him ps the fulfillment a jesu hang on the cro be find in these word the chief priest mock him with the scribe and elder say he save other himself he can not save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cro and we will believe him he trust in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he say i be the son of god the thieve also which be crucify with him cast the same in hi tooth matt promised messiah pp emphasi add ps read a follow all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head say he trust on the lord jehovah that he would deliver him let him deliver him see he delight in him mcconkie say these verse have their fulfillment a jesu hang on the cro that mean the person who wa scorn in these verse wa christ who then wa the lord in whom he trust it wa jehovah the father another example involf ps and ps regarding them mcconkie state the follow with reference to the connive and conspire plot incident to my lord arrest and judicial trial the prophecy wa they take counsel together against me they devise to take away my life ps a to the role of juda in those conspiracy the psalmist say mine own familiar friend in whom i trust which do eat of my bread hath lift up hi heel against me ps promised messiah p apostle mcconkie say these psalm refer to christ arrest and judicial trial we shall first consider ps and then ps while mcconkie only quote verse of ps verse will also be include to give a complete understand of the matter for i have hear the slander of many fear wa on every side while they take counsel together against me they devise to take away my life but i trust in thee o lord jehovah i say thou art my god elohim ps mcconkie say verse refer to jesu christ verse go on to tell that he christ trust in the lord who be call hi god or elohim mormonism teach that the god above jesu be elohim the father verse however reveal that the elohim of the man jesu be jehovah the father in ps mcconkie only quote one verse however two verse will be consider in thi examination yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trust which do eat of my bread hath lift up hi heel against me but thou o lord jehovah be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them ps mcconkie state above that verse refer to juda role in christ death since it wa juda who wa the familiar friend who lift up hi heel the pronoun mine i my and me in verse must refer to christ notice that at the begin of verse there be a change of pronoun to thou which refer to the lord jehovah then the pronoun me and i which refer to christ be use again that mean christ wa speak to jehovah the father in these verse another example involf mcconkie follow remark about ps one of the great messianic prophecy speak by the mouth of david say the lord hath swear and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek ps promised messiah p mcconkie admit thi be a messianic prophecy involve christ the question be what in thi verse refer to christ the lord jehovah hath swear and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek ps do the lord which be jehovah refer to christ if mcconkie be right and jesu be jehovah but the father be not then the lord would have to refer to christ but who then be the one address a the priest forever after the order of melchizedek the bible reveal that the one refer to be jesu christ heb therefore the lord jehovah in ps be the father another example involf isa of these verse mcconkie state of the atone sacrifice of the future messiah isaiah say the lord ha lay on him the iniquity of u all it please the lord to bruise him promised messiah p emphasi add mcconkie rightly say these verse refer to the atone sacrifice of the future messiah however what he fail to mention be that they also prove that the father be jehovah verse read all we like sheep have go astray we have turn every one to hi own way and the lord jehovah hath lay on him christ the iniquity of u all and verse read yet it please the lord jehovah to bruise him christ obviously the lord who lay on christ the iniquity of u all and who bruise him be god the father who be call jehovah in these verse remember mcconkie state that some sectarian even believe that jehovah be the supreme deity and that christ come into mortality a hi only begotten son he call thi concept misinformation that be untrue to prove that it be mcconkie who be misinform and believe untruth two scriptural reference sam ps will be examine mcconkie state the follow regard these scripture in the midst of a passage that be clearly messianic the lord say of the seed of david i will be hi father and he shall be my son sam in the second psalm the whole of which be also clearly messianic occur thi statement thou art my son thi day have i beget thee ps paul quote both of these statement in hebrew and say they be prophecy that christ would come a the son of god promised messiah p mcconkie cite heb to show that sam and ps refer to christ who would come a the son of god since mcconkie first reference sam thi examination will too however along with verse verse will also be include and a since the time that i command judge to be over my person israel and have cause thee to rest from all thine enemy also the lord jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an house and when thy day be fulfil and thou shalt sleep with thy father i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowel and i will establish hi kingdom he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of hi kingdom for ever i will be hi father and he shall be my son sam these verse teach that the lord jehovah would have a son the messiah in the second example mcconkie cite ps thi examination will include verse notice that it be the lord jehovah who say thou art my son thi day have i beget thee i will declare the decree the lord jehovah hath say unto me thou art my son thi day have i beget thee ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost part of the earth for thy possession mcconkie say these verse of scripture be clearly messianic and he acknowledge they teach that christ would come a the son of god what he be not will to acknowledge however be that these scripture also teach that the father be jehovah and that the sectarian who believe jehovah be the supreme deity whose son be jesu christ the only begotten be right in their belief another example involf mic of thi verse mcconkie state the follow and so truly do my lord act during hi mortal ministry truly thi be he of whom it be write he shall stand and fee in the strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord hi god for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth mic promised messiah p emphasi add according to mcconkie the pronoun he at the begin of mic refer to christ during hi mortal ministry who then be the lord hi god mic read and he christ shall stand and fee in the strength of the lord jehovah in the majesty of the name of the lord jehovah hi god elohim for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth obviously the lord of jesu christ be jehovah the father who be refer to a jehovah hi elohim another example involf ps and isa of these verse mcconkie state the follow a number of messianic passage speak of the lord and hi anoint ps signify that the chosen one wa consecrate and set apart for the ministry and mission that wa hi jesu apply these passage to himself by quote isaiah prophecy the lord hath anoint me to preach good tide unto the meek isa and then say thi day be thi scripture fulfil in ymy ear luke promised messiah pp emphasi add the first source mcconkie quote ps read a follow the king of the earth set themself and the ruler take counsel together against the lord jehovah and against hi anoint mcconkie say the anoint one wa christ if that be true who wa jehovah if jehovah be alway christ who wa the anoint one obviously jehovah be refer to god the father and the anoint be indeed refer to christ the second source mcconkie cite be isa which state the spirit of the lord adonai god jehovah be upon me because the lord jehovah hath anoint me to preach good tide unto the meek he hath send me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captive and the open of the prison to them that be bind the one who wa anoint to preach bind up proclaim and open wa jesu christ who then wa the one who anoint him thi verse say the lord jehovah do the anoint again we face the same problem if jehovah do not refer to the father but only to christ then jesu anoint someone but who a mcconkie point out jesu apply these passage to himself therefore the jehovah who anoint christ be god the father other example could be cite to show that mcconkie and other mormon leader be wrong when they say god the father be not jehovah however these should be enough to expose their error now what about mormonism claim that jesu be jehovah but he be not elohim it be true that jesu be jehovah the follow scripture prove thi fact thu saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and hi redeemer the lord jehovah of host i be the first and i be the last and beside me there be no god isa jesu say i be the first and the last i be he that liveth and wa dead rev saith the lord jehovah they shall look upon me whom they have pierce and they shall mourn for him a one mourneth for hi only son zech behold he christ cometh with cloud and every eye shall see him and they also which pierce him rev i be the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel isa ye deny the holy one christ and the just act and it shall come to pa that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord jehovah shall be deliver joel the name of jesu christ of nazareth there be none other name under heaven give among man whereby we must be save act behold the lord god jehovah will come with strong hand hi reward be with him isa behold i christ come quickly and my reward be with me rev the lord jehovah my god shall come and all the saint with thee zech at the come of my lord jesu christ with all hi saint thes the lord jehovah be my shepherd ps jesu say i be the good shepherd john saith the lord god jehovah i will seek that which wa lose ezek the son of man be come to seek and to save that which wa lose luke for i be the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel thy savimy isa looking for that bless hope and the gloriou appear of the great god and my savimy jesu christ tit see also jer and rev mal and heb kin and john isa and tim ps and matt and rev while mormon be right when they say jesu be jehovah they be wrong when they say he be not elohim the bible reveal that jehovah be the only true elohim there be all other be false remember jehovah be the personal name of the triune god who ha reveal himself in the bible before we consider biblical quote which show that jehovah and elohim be not two separate god a mormon claim let u first note that not only be both god the father and christ address a jehovah and elohim but so be the holy spirit whereof the holy ghost say thi be the covenant that i will make with them after those day saith the lord i will put my law into their heart and in their mind will i write them and their sin and iniquity will i remember no more heb emphasi on holy ghost and say add behold the day come saith the lord jehovah that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah i will put my law in their inward part and write it in their heart and will be their god elohim and they shall be my person i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more jer emphasi add for the prophecy come not in old time by the will of man but holy man of god spake a they be move by the holy ghost pet emphasi on holy ghost add the spirit of the lord jehovah spake by me and hi word wa in my tongue sam see also heb with ps let u now continue with the biblical quote which show that jehovah and elohim be not two separate god a mormon claim and when the lord jehovah saw that he mosis turn aside to see god elohim call unto him out of the midst of the bush and say mosis mosis and he say here be i bruce r mcconkie acknowledge that it wa christ voice that speak to mosis in the burn bush promised messiah p and the lord jehovah say and mosis say unto god elohim behold when i come unto the child of israel and shall say unto them the god elohim of ymy father hath send me unto you and they shall say to me what be hi name what shall i say unto them and god elohim say unto mosis i am that i am and he say thu shalt thou say unto the child of israel i am hath send me unto you and god elohim say moreover unto mosis thu shalt thou say unto the child of israel the lord jehovah god elohim of ymy father the god elohim of abraham the god elohim of isaac and the god elohim of jacob hath send me unto you thi be my name for ever and thi be my memorial unto all generation exod and god elohim spake unto mosis and say unto him i be the lord jehovah exod i be the lord jehovah and there be none else there be no god elohim beside me i gird thee though thou hast not know me isa but the lord jehovah be the true god elohim he be the live god elohim and an everlasting king jer thu saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and hi redeemer the lord jehovah of host i be the first and i be the last and beside me there be no god elohim isa therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascu saith the lord jehovah whose name be the god elohim of host amo behold the heaven and the heaven of heaven be the lord jehovah thy god elohim the earth also with all that therein be deut wherefore thou art great o lord jehovah god elohim for there be none like thee neither be there any god elohim beside thee accord to all that we have hear with my ear sam and he say unto them i be an hebrew and i fear the lord jehovah the god elohim of heaven which hath make the sea and the dry land jon for who be god elohim save the lord jehovah or who be a rock save my god elohim ps blessed be the nation whose god elohim be the lord jehovah ps see also ps hast thou not know hast thou not hear that the everlasting god elohim the lord jehovah the creator of the end of the earth fainteth not neither be weary there be no search of hi understand isa the mighty god elohim even the lord jehovah hath speak and call the earth from the rise of the sun unto the go down thereof ps sing unto god elohim sing praise to hi name estol him that rideth upon the heaven by hi name jah and rejoice before him ps regarding the word jah bruce r mcconkie state jah hebrew yah be a contract form of jehovah jahveh or yahweh all of which name have reference to christ the god of israel mormon doctrine p and david arise and go with all the person that be with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god elohim whose name be call by the name of the lord jehovah of host that dwelleth between the cherub sam the great the mighty god elohim the lord jehovah of host be hi name jer o my god elohim make them like a wheel a the stubble before the wind fill their face with shame that they may seek thy name o lord jehovah that man may know that thou whose name alone be jehovah art the most high over all the earth ps the bible clearly teach that jehovah be elohim in fact he be the only elohim there be he be the true the live the mighty the great and the everlasting elohim he be the elohim of israel of all the kingdom of the earth and of the heaven he be the creator who make the heaven and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon jehovah name be elohim of host amo not only be jehovah elohim but elohim be jehovah the bible reveal that elohim name be jah ps jehovah ps and jehovah of host sam jer the nation whose elohim be jehovah be bless ps clearly thi be not the jehovah and elohim of the mormon another mormon error regard elohim and jehovah be the belief that elohim not jehovah be the father of all the spirit include jesu in the article of faith by apostle jame e talmage a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve apostle state that god the eternal father be the literal parent of the spirit of the human race p thi doctrinal exposition also state explicitly that jesu christ be not the father of the spirit who have take or yet shall take body upon thi earth for he be one of them he be the son a they be son and daughter of elohim p the apostle talmage state that elohim be the name-title of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit be jehovah jesu the christ p the apostle bruce r mcconkie state the follow about thi matter jehovah-christ do in fact create the earth and all form of plant and animal life on the face thereof but when it come to place man on earth there wa a change in creator that be the father himself become personally involve all thing be create by the son use the power delegate by the father except man in the spirit and again in the flesh man wa create by the father there wa no delegation of authority where the crown creature of creation wa concern promised messiah p emphasi add mormon leader claim that jehovah-christ do not create either man spirit or hi body they maintain that the mormon elohim who be the father create man both in spirit and body the bible reveal the truth about who create man and mosis spake unto the lord jehovah say let the lord jehovah the god elohim of the spirit of all flesh set a man over the congregation num see also emphasi add the lord jehovah which stretcheth forth the heaven and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him zech emphasi add the lord jehovah make u thi soul jer for i will not contend for ever neither will i be alway wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the soul which i have make saith the lord jehovah isa emphasi on soul i have make add behold i be the lord jehovah the god elohim of all flesh jer emphasi add thu saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that form thee from the womb i be the lord jehovah that maketh all thing isa emphasi add thu saith the lord jehovah i have make the earth and create man upon it isa emphasi add god elohim create man upon the earth unto thee it wa shew that thou mightest know that the lord jehovah he be god elohim there be none else beside him deut thu saith god el the lord jehovah he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the person upon it and spirit to them that walk therein isa thu saith the lord jehovah of host the god elohim of israel i have make the earth the man and the beast that be upon the grind jer most emphasi add the bible reveal that it be jehovah who be the elohim of the spirit of all flesh and of all flesh itself that it wa he who form the spirit of man within him that he make u thi soul and form u from the womb he do indeed create man if mormon leader be right when they say jesu be jehovah then they be wrong when they say he do not create man if they be right when they say the father be the one who create man then they be wrong when they say he be not jehovah although mormon leader teach that jesu do not create man mormon scripture teach that he do the bom state the follow behold i be jesu christ i be the father and the son and never have i show myself unto man whom i have create for never ha man believe in me a thou hast behold thi body which ye now behold be the body of my spirit and man have i create after the body of my spirit eth emphasi add for it be i that taketh upon me the sin of the world for it be i that hath create them mo emphasi add the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob be that same god who create the heaven and the earth and all thing that in them be behold he create adam mor emphasi add d c state that the world be make by him christ man be make by him all thing be make by him and through him and of him emphasi add another error by bruce r mcconkie involve jehovah and hi creation be the belief that jehovah have many pre-mortal spirit help him create included in thi allege group wa joseph smith jr that he christ wa aid in the creation of thi earth by many of the noble and great spirit child of the father be evident from abraham write unto those superior spirit christ say we will go down for there be space there and we will take of these material and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell abra michael or adam wa one of these enoch noah abraham mosis peter jame and john joseph smith and many other noble and great one play a part in the great creative enterprise doctrine of salvation vol pp mormon doctrine p the bible reveal the truth about thi matter thu saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that form thee from the womb i be the lord jehovah that maketh all thing that stretcheth forth the heaven alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself isa which alone spreadeth out the heaven and treadeth upon the wave of the sea job jehovah by himself create all thing he have no allege preexistent spirit helper assist him regarding the mormon the apostle mcconkie state elohim plural word though it be be also use a the exalt name-title of god the eternal father a usage that connote hi supremacy and omnipotence he be god above all god mormon doctrine p he also state that jesu be above all save the father only promised messiah p the bible state that the one who be god above all so-called god be the triune god jehovah for the lord jehovah be a great god el and a great king above all god elohim ps for thou lord jehovah art high above all the earth thou art exalt far above all god elohim ps now i know that the lord jehovah be greater than all god elohim exod see also ps deut if mormon leader be right when they say jehovah be god the son and elohim be god the father these verse from the bible would be teach that the mormon son be above hi father however a mcconkie clearly state mormon believe elohim the father not jehovah the son be the god above all god that jesu be above all except the father yet the bible teach that jehovah be above all elohim at a byu dev on march bruce r mcconkie make the follow remark about pray to jesu another peril be that those so involve often begin to pray directly to christ because of some special friendship they feel ha be develop thi be plain sectarian nonsense my prayer be address to the father and to him only perfect prayer be address to the father in the name of the son it be utter by the power of the holy ghost my relationship with the lord pp mcconkie state on p of hi book promised messiah that the mormon pray to the father not the son on p of the same book mcconkie state that christ the son be jehovah thi be important to remember because although mcconkie say prayer be not to be offer to the mormon christ who be jehovah the bible state repeatedly in the ot that person pray to jehovah and he not only hear those prayer but he accept them a valid request the follow be but a small sample of the vast number of time person pray to jehovah in my distres i call upon the lord jehovah and cry unto my god elohim he hear my voice out of hi temple and my cry come before him even into hi ear ps and the lord jehovah say unto him i have hear thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast make before me i have hallow thi house which thou hast build to put my name there for ever and mine eye and mine heart shall be there perpetually kin and say unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee my supplication be accept before thee and pray for u unto the lord jehovah thy god elohim even for all thi remnant jer o lord jehovah i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servant who desire to fear thy name neh and it wa so that when solomon have make an end of pray all thi prayer and supplication unto the lord jehovah he arise from before the altar of the lord jehovah from kneel on hi knee with hi hand spread up to heaven kin he go in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and pray unto the lord jehovah kin go and say to hezekiah thu saith the lord jehovah the god elohim of david thy father i have hear thy prayer i have see thy tear behold i will add unto thy day fifteen year isa i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hide i say i will confes my transgression unto the lord jehovah and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin for thi shall every one that be godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be find ps notice above in ps that the godly pray to jehovah according to mcconkie and other mormon leader that be christ the very one to whom mcconkie say person should not pray the bible reveal there be only one true elohim and hi name be jehovah all other elohim be false they be idol that cause their follower to commit adultery against the true elohim and idolatry for the lord jehovah be great and greatly to be praise he be to be fear above all god elohim for all the god elohim of the nation be idol but the lord jehovah make the heaven ps thou shalt have no other god elohim before me exod now i know that the lord jehovah be greater than all god elohim exod and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god elohim and walk after other god elohim and serve them and worship them i testify against you thi day that ye shall surely perish deut thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their god elohim they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me for if thou serve their god elohim it will surely be a snare unto thee exod take heed to yourself that ymy heart be not deceive and ye turn aside and serve other god elohim and worship them deut that ye come not among these nation these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their god elohim nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourself unto them josh neither walk after other god elohim to ymy hurt jer but the lord jehovah be the true god elohim he be the live god elohim jer and they forsake the lord jehovah god elohim of their father which bring them out of the land of egypt and follow other god elohim of the god elohim of the person that be round about them and bow themself unto them and provoke the lord jehovah to anger jud shall a man make god elohim unto himself and they be no god elohim therefore behold i will thi once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name be the lord jehovah jer and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord jehovah choose you thi day whom ye will serve whether the god elohim which ymy father serve that be on the other side of the flood or the god elohim of the amorite in whose land ye dwell but a for me and my house we will serve the lord

god elohim of moab and the god elohim of the child of ammon and the god elohim of the philistine and forsake the lord jehovah and serve not him thi examination ha show that the elohim of mormonism like the elohim in ju be not the true jehovah elohim therefore the person who leave the true elohim for the mormon elohim will do evil in the sight of the lord jehovah although mcconkie attack christian for their belief in a triune god who be spirit and for their belief that god the father jehovah send hi son into the world these belief be true god be triune he be spirit he be jehovah and he do send hi son into the world to redeem mankind it be obviou from thi examination that it be not the christian who thrash around in darknes about who elohim and jehovah be one wonder what holy writ mcconkie have in mind when he state that it attest to the fact that elohim be the father and that jehovah be the son he certainly do not mean the bible which teach that the father son and holy spirit be all the one jehovah elohim he apparently do not mean the d c either because chapter verse refer to the father a jehovah summary obviously joseph fielding smith statement that the mormon have a

mormon jesu be different from the christian jesu he state that it be true that many of the christian church worship a different jesu christ than be worship by the mormon or the church of jesu christ of latter-day saint p the person who believe in the mormon jesu be commit adultery against god and idolatry they do not have the son therefore they do not have the father and they do not have eternal life a the apostle bruce r mcconkie rightly state salvation come only by worship the true god promised messiah p mcconkie also rightly state that the mere worship of a god who ha the proper scriptural name do not assure one that he be worship the true and live god because the true name of deity can be apply to false concept of god mormon doctrine p remember that the apostle stephen l richard admit that joseph smith jr give a new conception of god and the godhead contribution of joseph smith p it be important for the person who have leave the true triune god reveal in the bible to repent and return to him they must forsake the sin of idolatry and adultery which they be commit in mormonism the bible say all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be write in the earth because they have forsake the lord jehovah the fountain of live water jer and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god elohim and walk after other god elohim and serve them and worship them i testify against you thi day that ye shall surely perish deut thou shalt make no covenant with their god elohim exod put away the strange god elohim that be among you and be clean and change ymy garment gen flee from idolatry cor it be necessary that christian heed the warn of the bible if they do they will not fall into the sin of adultery against god and idolatry
