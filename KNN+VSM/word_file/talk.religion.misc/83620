subject re after year can we say that christian m from nunnally john nunnally in livesey write in article frank frank write good question my point wa that a world with truth be better than a world with falsehood a world in which it be possible to say ye i be hold a jew the truth and you me the jew and the ss guy all sit down to crack open a bottle of whiskey be better than the grim alternative you present obviously thi be not possible and the best alternative seem to be to lie that because other value be involve such a life now that is just my opinion do confuse the claim morality exist with the claim have a lock on moral i think that at thi point it would actually be quite easy to confuse objective morality with relative morality jon actually jon that be quite true christian person have cause objective morality to look very relative after all that wa the point of the original question in thi thread can we tos out christianity because it be so obviously inconsistent with it own principle if you will bear with me i will attempt to explain thi apparent inconsistency from at least one christian viewpoint if god exist and be the creator of mankind a the bible claim then he ha a pretty well-defined concept of what make person tick physically emotionally etc god ha an objective morality for u that be to say he ha no trouble understand what be good for or detrimental to the creature he create galatian for we mankind be hi workmanship create in christ jesu for good work a morality which god prepare beforehand a well-defined design that we might walk in them however contrary to what many person assume include the pharasee of the bible god morality can not be completely codify in a list of rule and regulation to some extent every activity of a person life create a new situation to which morality must be apply there never could be enough volume to codify god objective morality for u throughout history mankind ha try to reduce morality to a list of rule objectivity if you please in the old testament we have both principle and specific rule by the time of jesu most of the principle be obscure by the emphasi man have place on the rule volume of additional rule have be make to try to codify the application of the principle we mankind be comfortable with the subjectivity of principle for reference see matthew where jesu explain the difference between the law and the principle of the law for example in verse you have hear that the ancient be tell shall not commit murder and commit murder shall be liable to the court but i say to you that everyone who be angry with hi brother shall be liable to the court the objective morality of god get blur by my inept interpretation of it we christian have make my biggest error when we have allow any one person or group of person decide exactly what god intend for u if we christian would stay commit to seek god will instead of try to prove we already have it all figure out we might do a better job of allow other to find god objective morality for themself if jesu be who he say he and that the fundamental question then he is objective morality john nunnally
