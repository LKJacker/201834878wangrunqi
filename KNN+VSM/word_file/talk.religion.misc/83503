from dickeney dick eney subject re swastika wa hitler pagan or christian the observation that the tree of life would rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably do give enough consideration to the feeblenes of the corioli force compare to say the phototropism of vegetation a much more likely explanation be the classic one that the clockwise swastika be the sun-wheel because the sun progress acros the sky that way although that not the historical way it happen clock be first make a little imitation image of the sun move thru the heaven so it more valid to talk of the clock go sunwise but do the engineer listen to me of course not anyway there be still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika go counter-sunwise because that represent evil or because it be the sun twin-opposite the moonwheel the use of anti-sun to represent evil may be because human be so strongly visually-oriented but i not go to try to settle that one just now diccon frankborn dickeney
