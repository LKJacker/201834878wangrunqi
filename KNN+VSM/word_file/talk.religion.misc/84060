from david utidjian subject re the fact of the theory jim and andy both have it incorrect i believe the fact be what be there the process that exist in the present or the physical evidence of the process have occur in the past these fact exist with or without a theory the theory try and explain the fact and how they relate to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that be both coherent and useful that it can be use to make prediction the fact of gravity evolution electromagnetic radiation relativity atom will exist and behave in the way in which they behave regardles of whether we have a theory to try and explain how they interact or even why a theory never really become a fact but a theory can predict the existence of a previously unknown fact and if we find thi fact a the theory predict we say the theory be support by the fact a theory be a mental construct a speculation a model if it be a good model it may be useful in science a theory be something that be support by the evidence considerable evidence sometime all of the evidence a hypothesi be a new fledgling theory because there be not yet enough evidence to support it when a new hypothesi be propose to replace an exist theory it must explain all of the fact that the current theory explain and at least some of the fact that the current theory could not predict new fact it be so simple i surprise that thi subject get beat to death about once a month a quick glance in a dictionary would clear up of the confusion and bandwidth in thi newsgroup then we could talk about really important thing like why do man have nipple david utidjian utidjian
