from brian brian ceccarelli subject re is it good that jesu die brian ceccarelli write that me kent i be not accuse you of evil thing jesu be accuse you and it be not only you that he be accuse he be accuse everyone me you and everyone in the world be guilty whether one see the light or do not see the light ha nothing to do with whether we do evil thing we do them regardles kent sandvik respond hmm it seem that thi be the core of christianity then you have to feel guilty i think i see where you be come from kent jesu do view guilt like my modern venacular color it feeling have nothing to do with guilt feeling arise from the state of be guilty feeling and guilt be mutally exclusive feeling be a reaction from guilt jesu be talk about the guilt state not the reaction let me give you an example have you ever make a mistake have you ever lie to someone even a little white lie have you ever claim to know something that you really do know have you ever hat someone have you ever be selfish are you guilty of any one of these the answer be of course ye you be guilty period that be it what jesu be get at no big surprise feeling do not even enter the picture consider jesu use of the word guilt a how a court use it jesu be concern that everyone should admit that they be guilty of be imperfect the bible call it the state that we be all sinner we all do bad thing even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong be proof of my guilt that we be all sinner it be it in my nature to do bad thing we be sinner therefore we do bad thing being a sinner be fact it be not a pleasant fact but it be just a fact we be not perfect calling u sinner should have no more emotional charge to you than call you a human be guilty a charge and then there thi single personality that will save you from thi universal guilt feel you can handle ymy guilt in one of two way acknowledge you make a mistake learn from it and try to not do it again in the meantime not punish yourself for it which be the way jesu want you to handle or it thi be the healthy way or two the destructive way put yourself down slap yourself and feel like crap never forgive yourself force yourself to say a thousand hail mary even to suicide thi the way jesu do not want u to deal with it all person fall into thi category to some extent in their life jesu be not in the busines of save u from thi guilt feel jesu be in the busines of show u how much he love u despite my guilt jesu know we be guilty that be new to him it be no big deal to him he just want you to realize that thi sinful nature destroy the relationship between you and him that be what he want you to know why because he want to have ymy company you be immensely valuable to him jesu want a relationship with you however in my present sinful nature we be incapable of have thi relationship god be perfect we be not you can not fit a square peg into a round hole however god ha provide a way for u to change my nature so that we can have a relationship with him god ha provide jesu so that whosoever just believe in jesu will have their nature change the holy spirit will move it and now divine nature be now within life my very be and u and god communicate with each through hi unify holy spirit the benefit of thi be endles for with the divine nature live within u we can now see my imperfection better we can now head them off at the pa with the power of the holy spirit live in u we now have hi power to help u overcome my shortcoming because the divine nature life within u we can now understand profound bible passage that never before we could understand because the divine nature now life within u we now have authority over demonic force and lastly because the divine nature now life within u we have eternal life for the holy spirit be eternal the relationship with jesu be of the utmost importance because it be not what you do in life that qualify you to belong to heavenly kingdom it be ymy relationship to the live god remember what jesu say at the tail end of matthew when he separate the goat from the sheep many person in the last day will ask him did i prophesy in ymy name and do miracle and do good thing in ymy name and what do jesu say depart from me for i never know you that be the cornerstone of christianity kent jesu must know you a hi friend it be ymy relationship to jesu if he be ymy friend and you be hi you will be count among those who will share in hi inheritance in heaven brian i will tell you a secret i do feel guilty at all i do mistake and i regret them however i never have thi huge guilt feel hang over my shoulder good it show that you have a strong self-image that you love yourself that be the second greatest commandment jesu teach if only more person could do a you do a i say before in the common english venacular feel guilty ha a different mean than the state of guilt thi all be a very clear indication that you need a certain personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain religiou doctrine and if ymy personality type be opposite then you be not that easily attach to a certain world view system i believe what we all need in my personality be a lot le ego a lot le self-centerednes and a lot more unconditional love there be human that subscribe to the same notion the nice thing be that when you finally shake off thi huge burden the shoulder feel far more relax ye you have state what jesu say remember come to me take my yoke upon ymy shoulder for my burden be light a yoke be use to direct ox to do work once you have a relationship with jesu you and him share the yoke and the burden of life having god at ymy side be of great advantage
