from jeffj chao subject re under literary critical analysi in article dzkriz denni kriz write hi all i go to try to do something here that perhap many would not have think even possible i want to begin the proces of initiate a literary critical study of the pornography post on to identify the major theme and motif present in the story post there open up then the possibility of an objective moral evaluation of the material present there first off let me congratulate you for not post a flame about you sick pervert you be immoral you be all go to hell which seem to be the usual religiou post find on the hierarchy hopefully you wo get flame either you will however be argue with i personally think that ymy project be build on unsteady grind first i do not believe that there be any way to find an objective morality morality and value be inherently subjective they represent the belief of a person or a group of person they can be widely hold perhap even overwhelmingly hold but they be never and can never be objective assumption a christian bedrock assumption that all that be true come truly from god regarding while perhap even from an objective standpoint the majority of it material be indeed repugnant you come to thi conclusion quite quickly when you start think about analyze it material like thi some of it reflect some fairly profound need in person a well a some truth and deserve to be point out second i do not accept the assumption that you make here if a you say you be try to be objective then why accept a morality to begin with by use the christian bible you defeat ymy own purpose by do so in the long run the advantage of make such a analysi be that it will save band-width between christian and non mutually flame each other about the moral acceptability of the stuff on these pornographic group third call me a pessimist but you wo stop the flamage there will alway be person who pop upin to tell u how sick and twist and evil we all be just out of curiosity do reader show up unprovoked in the religion group to tell you all that you be narrow-minded censor overbear totalitarianist basically there should not be a dissonance between a christian morality and a non-christian one either there be value in a particular work or there be not whether one be a christian or not hm let me provide an example fmy person get together over dinner to discus morality you me a rather conservative moslem and a sociopath i start off by say that i think it immoral to force person to have sex with you you agree but also say that it be immoral to have sex with someone of ymy own gender just a note i really do know ymy view on homosexuality i be just use thi a a common view of morality for the purpose of thi example the moslem say that it be immoral for woman to have their face uncover the sociopath who ha become bore kill all three of u and eat u but feel no guilt because he ha do nothing wrong morally in hi own mind in support for the first assumption the christian scripture say thi evidence delete i not go to accept ymy evidence for thi you ask u to accept the word of god that everything good come from god thi be only a valid argument for a person who share ymy belief still i must say that catalog the major theme and motif in erotica could be interest for other reason than your so good luck with thi next part now then what be some of the major in the pornographic literature on place like these be some that i be able to identify please on them motif the male-cinderella in so many of the story there be express a feel of alienation and worthlessnes on the part of the writer or otherwise protagonist of the story with regard to the object the other person of desire often a story involf a protagonist who on the surface be quite average but underneath usually ha an enormou dick who desire to in some way to gain acces in a definitely sexual way to the other person who confess be far more desireable than be and who indeed seem to walk between the rain-drop hmmm do i detect just a wee bite of condescence here motif a celebration of indeed preoccupation with beauty not very objective the vast majority of pornographic literature deal with beauty be it innocence somehow about to be lose grace or simply physical beauty and generally most person christian or non will say that beauty be good one could construe thi to mean that beautiful person be better or more good than non-beautiful person i would hope that person relize that thi be not necessarily true motif one dick is one instrument of redemption might i suggest the word peni it seem more in line with the tone of ymy post blessed be those who be well-hung for they shall get lay from what would thu be a revise matthew bravo i respect you and ymy sense of humor sir motif sex a an expression of sincere giving there be often enough a clear desire on the part of the protagonist to give definitely sexual pleasure to the object person of desire ye and thi theme be usually what the better story be about however they be not alway selfish i could point to example in the work of elf sternberg for example motif describe a sex which is completely removed from the realm of transmitting life so remove be sex from it procreative dimension on that one begin to wonder why sex even involf ejaculation a in the context describe in pornography it serve then no real purpose it serve the same purpose a it do in pornographic movie it affirm the virility of the male involve a well a assure the reader that he the character ha orgasmed the whole picture tm be probably very well describe by the catholic teach on thi of the husband and wife in an act of total mutual self-giving in the sexual union cooperate with god in open themself up for the transmission of new life cf humane vita ymy whole picture tm unfortunately only apply to person who accept ymy church in addition if sex be for procreation then why do god make it pleasurable so that person would want to do it rather than build it in a instinct why do god make it fallible not every sexual encounter result in pregnancy even among catholic do thi mean that they have sin in any case and the catholic teach will probably not see eye to eye on thi for a long time granted motif sex used a an instrument violence power and humiliation why pornography seem to tend in that direction i really do not know probably volume could be write on the relationship between sex and but thi probably gife good reason why traditionally judeo-christianity ha be so negative with regard to sexuality it seem to tend to a great moral moras pornography would not tend in those direction if there be not a demand for it many person have violent fantasy that they would never act out in real life but will think about and read about and mull over later jeff jeffj official generic sig under line under column no amiga check no witty quote no map of australium no asterisk no ascius
