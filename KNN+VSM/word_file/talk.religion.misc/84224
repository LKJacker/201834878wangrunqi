from drake drake subject re rfd in article tim write let u not limit to but if we do limit it to something the discussion degenerate into a big amorphou glob hmm be you a taoist imposing limit do do something useful it gife you something to go beyond it seem to me that these question more properly fall into the category of general metaphysic i would prefer any to deal more closely with topic and work more closely associate with at least semi-orthodox taoism with establish classic work definitely include and work like mantak chium argue about i tend to be a bite critical of any stratification of taoism i especially tend to frown on any suggestion that orthodoxy or classic have any special place in tao i think neo-taoism should be exclude or get it own group what i mean by thi be humpty-dumpty taoism in which taoism mean whatever a poster say it mean thi could also be a refuge for debate about what taoism really mean or speculation on sexual alchemy etc so rather than debate what taoism really mean you be suggest that we take someone else word for it and work thusly i rather not thank you what happen be that that the term taoism be become completely pollute and trivialize like the word magic alchemy zen etc by writer appropriate the word to mean whatever they want thi be see by the spate of new age book entitle the tao of thi that and everything else wherea you of course have a clear idea of what the word mean can you tell the tao any other i look forward to see them on balance i say let rip and let the chip fall where they may wonderful idea it just get fill up with college freshman ask about the tao of sex then it will have be a failure and person will post to these group just a they do now only if you choose to define failure in that way or to define it at all i believe in the flesh and the appetite seeing hear and feel be miracle and each part and tag of me be a miracle walt whitman
