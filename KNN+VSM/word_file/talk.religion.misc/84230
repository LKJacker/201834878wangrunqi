from ekr eric rescorla subject re after year can we say that christian morality be in article mlj frank frank write in article ekr eric rescorla write in article frank frank write in article ekr eric rescorla write if almost all person agree that the sun exist in the usual uncritical sense and almost all person agree that a deal be bad it a reasonable conclusion that the sun really do exist and that the deal really be bad i disagree completely until rather recently most person do not believe in evolution or the possibility of the atom bomb popular opinion be notoriously wrong about matter of fact true but nevertheles the basi of all matter of fact be overwhelm popular opinion and some overwhelm popular opinion be fact the sun shine if it be not so physic would be a personal matter assume to be different for each of u there would be yourgravity and mygravity and no theoretical framework to encompas them and predict both thi be simply complete nonsense the basi for of fact be if any clas of opinion the majority of informed popular opinion for some value of inform i would really hate to base my knowledge of for instance qm on what the overwhelm popular opinion be the basi eric be person peer at the world and say what they see i talk about uninterpreted fact observation person do those agreement on some observation be a prerequisite for a theory that be more than personal ye that true but you have to be clear exactly what be an uninterpreted observation it pretty low level stuff sun shine be already a lot higher level than that we can agree that perceive brightnes perhap now i take an experience of to be every bite a raw a fact a an experience of pain or vision that might seem like a good first pa gues but it turn out to be a pretty cruddy way to look at thing because we all seem to have rather different opinion experience about what be good and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter say you not compare apple with apple if we all look at the same meter we agree if we all in the same situation that when we agree on fundamental value if at all person who say that nobody agree on value to the same extent that they agree on trivial observation seem to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either huh what do you mean in the same situation let take me and denni kriz a example we in pretty different situation but i think we can agree a to whether it day or night i do think we can agree a to whether or not abortion be morally acceptable yet we be certainly in the same difference of situation with respect to each other look like weasel-word to me frank i do see that it any evidence at all a i point out above i really not interest very much in what the popular opinion be i prepare to trust to some extent the popular opinion about direct matter of physical observation because by and large they accord with my own however if everyone else say the dial read and it look like a to me i would hope that i would believe myself believe other person about these matter seem to have a reasonable probability of predict what i would believe if i observe myself but the possibility exist that it be not since i know from observation that other disagree with me about what be good i believe i can discount popular opinion about from the begin a a predictor of my opinion i would say that the fact that it seem almost impossible to get person to agree on what be good in a really large number of situation be probably the best evidence that objective morality be bogu actually firstly if everyone else say the dial wa and i saw i check my len prescription that up to you i gues secondly ymy observation that person disagree show nothing person may be look at different thing by virtue of be in different situation if i look at an elephant i see an elephant that do imply that you will see an elephant if you look at an iguana thi situation stuff be pretty confuse frank how do we decide if we be in the same situation you mind explain thirdly i question ymy assumption that when person disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goal that they therefore do not have the same fundamental goal that seem to be the disagreement you refer to huh i do think so i think that person disagree about fundamental goal ekr eric rescorla ekr would you buy use code from thi man
