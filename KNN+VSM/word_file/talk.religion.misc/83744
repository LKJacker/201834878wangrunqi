from brian brian ceccarelli subject re is it good that jesu die in article bskendig brian kendig write and i maintain some person do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone be their own master because they fear it they be too afraid of have to face the world on their own term and so by their own choice they will remain in darknes sort of like bug under a rock however some person but not many will not like the darknes sometime it get too cold and too dark to be comfortable these person will crawl out from under the rock and although blind at first will get accustom to the light and enjoy it warmth and after a while now that they can see thing for what they really be they will also see the height which they can reach and the place they can go and they will learn to choose their own path through the world and they will learn from their mistake and revel in their success are you ymy own master do you have any habit that you can not break for one you seem unable to master ymy lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the bible seem that ignorance ha you master how about sexual sin got tum any of those secret desire in ymy head that you harbor but can get control of do you dehumanize woman when they walk past you do you degrade them to a sex object in ymy head are you the master of that kind of think do you insult person unknowingly then regret it later yet do it again the next time opportunity present itself are you truly the master of yourself i have admit that i be not the master of my think life at all time that i sometime say thing i do want to say and then repeat my mistake unwantingly i have admit to myself that i can not control every aspect of my be there be time i know i should say something but then say it anyway there be time i simply forget a lesson i in fact be not my own master i need help jesu promise me thi help and i take him up on hi offer i have willfully let jesu be my master because jesu know what be better for me than i myself do and why not do not the creator know hi creation better than the creation do toyotum know what better for the corolla than the corolla do you see my point i think you the one under the rock and i get a great tan out here in the sunlight my life ha improve immesurably since i abandon theism come and join me it will be a difficult trip at first until you build up ymy muscle for the long hike but it well worth it then i gues ignorance be blis for you because brian you enjoy not have a clue about the bible do you see i not go to accept anything that i ca witnes with my own eye or experience with my own sense especially not something a mega-powerful a what you try to get me to accept surely if you believe in it thi strongly you must have a good reason to do you can you witnes motherly love with ymy sense how do care and concern for you register with ymy sense if nothing register to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become a vulcan and fast you better get rid of ymy emotion and i do have a good reason to believe what i do when do i say that i say that i would rather cease existing instead of be subject to the whim of a deity but that if the deity decide to tos me into the fiery pit because of who i be then so be it the topic wa about my god and ymy lack of knowledge about what my god say my god say that you will not cease existing you have life forever you can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there be no communication whatsoever or can choose to live it in paradise with god that be what my god say and that wa the issue ymy made-up theism be what it be make up it wishful think nope most person be christian most person be fond of feel that they be imperfect of believe that the world be an undesirable place of recite magical mystical prayer to make the world nice and holy again of do just a their priest tell them like good little sheep you enjoy darknes and you proud of it is thi the religion of kendigianism most person be not christian most person include christian be not fond of feel that they be imperfect is the world an undesireable place a doctrine of kendigianism it ha nothing to do with my god do kendigism have magical mystical prayer a a part of it worship mine do do kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again mine do do kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tell them like good little sheep mine do is thi a bunch of ly you tell yourself so that you can justify be ignorant of the bible brian follow christ ha nothing to do with the doctrine of kendigianism you would find any of ymy doctrine in the bible i do follow kendigianism i follow christ also to try to again show you ymy ignorance of christ and the bible in regard to priest have you not read about the sole melchizedek priest in hebrew and have you not read what the purpose be of the old testament levitical priesthood and why there should not be priest today ye gues what the catholic mess up i do not follow catholicism or any ism i follow christ nope you make decision enjoy ymy success and accept ymy failure then you die if you be content with the life you lead a you reflect back on it in ymy final moment then you lead a good life why would you want to live a good life to you you die and that it do contradict yourself you have no reason to live a good life it do do you any good in the end ymy life do do anybody else any good either because everyone dy anyway so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life be meaningles why do you do such a meaningles thing i sorry i do feel that sacrifice jesu wa something any god i worship would do unles the sacrifice wa only temporary in which case it not really all that important ha the resurrection sink in jesu be alive jesu be not dead jesu wa sacrified to fufill the old testament sacrificial system in it every detail jesu death wa like a seed he need to fall
