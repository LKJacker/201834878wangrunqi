from david david bold subject re question for those with popular morality in article pmy pete yadlowsky write moral driver distinction delete in thi case the driver do not evolve but simply is there would probably not be any manifestation in an infant because the moral code ha not be learn yet ie the object upon which the driver act upon without manifestation though how can the driver be detect for all purpose it seem not to exist until moral coding begin actually i agree with ymy notion of a driver except that i think it not moral but pre and super moral it be a i mention earlier in thi thread a primal sense of connection a pre and post-natal umbilical the awarenes of which be express in a partial fragment way that accomodate and form in return the language and custom of a give culture thi halt pidgin-english expression be i think what we come to call compare the driver to an urge such a jealousy where there be an urge and an object the jealousy do not technically exist until the object be apparent however the capacity to be jealou be presumably still there even though it be not detectable ymy description of the unbilical take me three pas to understand but i get the gist and i have to tentatively agree i think my two definition can sit side by side without too much trouble though i have attempt to define the reason behind the moral driver only hint through the essence of each moral ymy definition hint that animal be also capable of a similar morality simian have a similar social order to ourself and it be easy to anthropomorphize with these animal is thi possible or have i misunderstand if my suggestion hold true then thi be the area where work must be carry out to prevent a moral deterioration of society what kind of work exactly well here you have ask the big question i have a slight suspicion that you be hop i would say something really contentiou in thi reply from ymy final question no not at all i wa just wonder if you subscribe to some particular school of psycho-social think and rehabilitation and if perhap you have a plan i have be interest to hear it my think fall roughly in line with john stuart mill and hi write on utilitarianism i have no particular plan except to do my bite personal ethic and social work my opinion for what it be worth be that the authority for each moral must be increase somehow and that thi will probably take several generation to be effective i do think that the list of moral ha change for society significantly though the authority element may come from my authority figure and role model see eric berne and hi transactional analysi work mavi klein for reference and thi be what gife rise to a deterioration of moral standard in the long term i have some more think on my definition i wa think that i should add moral character to the list of definition in order to get a dynamic version of the moral nature ie the interplay of the moral code and associate authority a suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a hifi system the moral nature be the set of frequency and the choose and the moral character be the spectrum over time conscience be a little more difficult because i ca define it a the reason of a person between action in the context of hi moral nature because conscience seem to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted i think conscience be manifest when a decision be make at a give time which compromise one moral nature my conscience fit in more with freud superego plu the moral driver with the stimulou be the urge or freud id the reason that i mention before be freud ego i suppose if the moral driver be part of the id then the reason why conscience cut in unbidden be partially explain the question be what provide the stimulou to activate the moral driver i think i need some more time with thi one that about it for now david on religion oh where be the sea the fish cry a they swim it clearnes through
